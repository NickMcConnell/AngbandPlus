-<sob>-
...amen!
...but like a man he died.
3... 2... 1... Liftoff!
A guiltless death I die.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
AAAARRRGGGHHH!!!
Aaagghhh!
Aacch!
Aargh!
Ach, is doch nur 'ne Fleischwunde...
Adios.
AGAIN!?!?!
All clear, guys.
All is lost. Monks, monks, monks!
All my possessions for a moment of time!
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
And I just wanted that fancy suit of armour you were carrying...
And I've *never* done you any harm.
And in my last hour, I'm a slave to the power of death.
And now the dreams end.
And they told me it was not loaded.
And you thought Tristan was unlucky...
Another one bites the dust.
As I lay forgotten and alone, without fear I draw my parting groan.
Ay! Ay! Ay!
Bam!
Been nice knowing you...
Bif!
Blood will follow blood, dying time is here.
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends.
Brutality!
But for all his power I couldn't foresee my own demise.
But I just got a little prick!
But there are some things which cannot be excused.
But what about my Parry Skill? Tumbling?
By the kind gods, 'twas most ignobly done!
Can you say you are proud of what you've done?
Can't it be there's been some sort of error?
Can't we talk this thing over?
Can't you take a joke?
Catch my soul 'cos it's willing to fly away!
CHARGE!
Cover me.
Crapola.
CU!
Cut it out!
Dammit, this thing won't die!
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye.
Death means nothing, there is no end, I'll be reborn.
Death takes my hand and captures my soul...
Did anybody get the number of that truck..?
Did somebody knock?
Die, mortal!
Do let me die in peace.
Do something, SCHMUCK!
Don't let poor Nelly starve!
Don't worry - I have Pilot-7.
Don't worry, be happy!
Don't worry. I've got a plan.
Doough!
Dying, dying!
Eeek!
Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar!
Et tu, Caesar! Then fall, Brute!
Even the best laid plans...
Everyone dances with the Grim Reaper.
Exit: light - enter: night!
F***!
Farewell, cruel world.
Fatality!
Flames? Not yet, I think.
Flash before my eyes: now it's time to die.
Funny, didn't *look* like a cyberpsycho....
Gee, where'd everybody go?
Gee... thanks.
Goodbye.
Greetings, Death, I'm yours to take away.
Guh!
Ha! That's the oldest trick in the book.
Hah haa! Missed me! Ha---
He hit me for HOW MUCH?????
Heaven can wait 'till another day.
Help me!
Help me! I am undone!
Help, ho!
Hey - I've got lawyers!
Hey guys, where are you?
Hey look... ARCHERS!
Hey! Killin' ain't cool.
Hey! Where's my stomach? My hands?
Hey, don't talk to me like that!
Hey, it was only a joke, all right?
Hey, not too rough!
Hilfe, hilfe, hilfe!
Hmm, some things are better wanted than had...
Ho! Murder! Murder!
I am absolutely undone.
I am death incarnate! NOTHING can harm me!
I am dying.
I am innocent, innocent, innocent!
I AM toast!!
I believe my kingdom will come...
I can see armored women on winged horses coming for me...
I can't believe that really my time has come.
I can't probably miss...
I defy your morbid declarations!
I didn't like violence anyway!
I didn't want to live anyway.
I don't believe this!
I don't care. I have a Ring of Regeneration.
I don't care. I have a Scroll of Raise Dead.
I don't like this dungeon...
I don't understand. It should be dead by now.
I don't wanna die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?
I feel I could cast 'Speak with Dead' and talk to myself.
I feel the flowers growing over me.
I had such sweet thoughts...
I hate it when that happens.
I hate the RNG...
I hate you!
I have a very bad feeling about this.
I have led a happy life.
I have rights, too!
I have this dungeon at home, I know where everything is!
I let you hit me!
I must sleep now.
I never get to have any fun!
I pray you all pray for me.
I really screwed up this time.
I see a bright light...
I see it coming...aaargllhhhh! {cough}
I shall hear in heaven.
I should've listened to my mother...
I split my brain, melt through the floor.
I think this guy's a little crazy.
I thought you could be trusted.
I thought you liked me?
I thought you were on MY side...
I told you to be careful with that sword...
I was born for dying...
I will not kneel. Strike!
I will not yield.
I will now enter the Halls of Mandos.
I'll be back!
I'LL BE BACK!!!
I'll be back... as soon as I can.
I'll be back...
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you!
I'll never surrender.
I'll return!
I'll use the Cheat Death option...
I'm death incarnate! Nothing can harm me!
I'm going down.
I'm going home, babe.
I'm heir to the crown. They wouldn't dare!
I'm invincible!
I'm melting!
I'm not afraid of death. I just don't want to be there when it happens.
I'm off to Never-Never Land!
I'm so tired of living, I might as well end today.
I'm sure reinforcements will get here on time. They promised.
I'm the hero of this story! I CAN'T die!
I'm too young to die!
I've fallen and I can't get up!
Idiots! I am surrounded by incompetent idiots!
If you cut me down, I will only become more powerful.
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on!
Indulge your ineffective curse, I'll never die.
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?
Is not this dying with courage and true greatness?
Isn't it strange, as soon as you're born you're dying?
It didn't look so tough.
It is finished.
It is well. I die hard, but am not afraid to go.
It looked harmless.
It wasn't just a job it was an adventure!
It's all over.
It's game over, man!
It's just one of those days...
Join the army, see the world, they said...
Just because you're big and ugly doesn't mean you can push ME around.
Just wait till I get my hands on the crook who sold me this crappy armor...
Kill men i' the dark! What be these bloody thieves?
Later, dude...
Let me die to the sound of sweet music.
Let me handle this.
Life down there is just a strange illusion.
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say.
Life, life! Death, death! How curious it is!
Live and let live, right..?
Look! I'm flying!
Look, behind you!!!
Look, dad! No head!
Mama said there'd be days like this.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Me first! Me first!
Mein Leben!
Meine Lieder!
Mom told me there'd be days like this...
Mommy? Is that you?
Morons! I have morons on my payroll!
My body tries to leave my soul.
My creator will lay my soul to rest.
My god will protect me...
My life suffocates, planting seeds of hate.'
My wallet? In your dreams!
Never happy endings on these dark sets.
Never try to sneak in a plate mail.
New blood joins this earth...
Next time, try talking!
No more mr. nice guy!
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend.
No point asking who's to blame.
No problem. That's easy.
No time to make a testament?
No... a Bud light!
Not me!
Nothing is real but pain now.
Now I am cold, but a ghost lives in my veins.
Now it is come.
Nurse, nurse, what murder! What blood! I have done wrong!
O murderous slave! O villain!
O! I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
O! I die, Horatio...
O, falsely, falsely murder'd!
O, untimely death!
Of course I know what I am doing.
Off to Never-Never Land!
Oh man!
Oh no!
Oh No! Here I blow again!
Oh no, not again!
Oh shit... I'll try to teleport again.
Oh well, you can't always win.
Oh!
Oh, basely done! I had hoped for better of thee!
Oh, dear.
Oh, shit.
Oh, that's just a light wound.
Ohe! Ohe! Ohe!
Ok, ok, I get it: No more pals.
One direct hit can ruin your whole day.
Only the good die young, all the evil seem to live forever.
Oof..
Oops, sorry... didn't mean to disturb you.
Oops.
Ouch! That smarts!
Ouch.
Pow!
Quench the fire that drives my soul, soothing me as death takes toll.
Rats!
Run away!
Scheisse!
See you later, alligator!
Shall this fellow live?
Slave, thou hast slain me!
So what?
So when I die, the first thing I will see in heaven is a score list?
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell.
Somebody get me a Rod of Resurrection... QUICK!
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming!
Somehow I don't feel like killing anymore.
Somehow, I have a bad feeling about this...
Someone call the Gendarmes!
Stop!
Strangely, all of a sudden I don't feel so good.
Such senseless violence! I don't understand it.
Sucker shot!
Sure don't look good...
Surrender? Never!
Tell me this is an illusion... please!
Thanks, I needed that.
That unworthy hand! That unworthy hand!
The fat lady sang.
The higher you walk, the farther you fall.
The Random Number Generator hates me!
The rest is silence.
The shortest straw, pulled for me.'
There'll be nowhere else for you to run, when my hatred comes to life.
There's a time to live, and a time to die, when it's time to meet the maker.
There's got to be just more to it that this or tell me why do we exist?
They need a twenty to hit me! I'm invincible!
They say blood will have blood...
Think I'm gonna fall for that?
This can't be happening to me!
This fell sergeant, Death, is strict in his arrest...
This guy's a little crazy...
This HAS to be an illusion. I attempt to disbelieve it.
This is the End, my only friend.
Time for lust, time for lie, time to kiss your life goodbye.
Toasty!
Too much of a good thing, I guess...
Treason! Treason!
Trust me, I know what I'm doing...
Trust me.
Ugh!
Uhh... oh-oh...
Ungrateful traitors!
Up, up and awaaaayyy!
Violence is no solution!
Violent use brings violent plans.
Wait! Spare me and I'll make you rich! Money is not a problem!
Wally, what is this? It is death, my boy: they have deceived me.
Was that as close as I think it was?
Was that worth dying for?
Watch this.
Watch where you're pointing with that sword! You nearly...
We perish, we disappear, but the march of time goes on forever.
We won't live to fight another day.
Well, at least I tried...?
Well, I didn't much like this character, anyway...
What could possibly have gone wrong?
What do you mean 'aaargllhhhh'? Hey man, I've paid for this...
What do you mean, how many hit points do I have?
What do you mean, my GOI expired?
What hast thou done?
What ho! Help!
What is this? I've been stricken by fate!
What was that noise?
What's with that weirdo with the teeth?
What? Who? Me? Oh, s..t!
When the dream dies, the nightmare begins.
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Who fed steroids to that kobold?
Who knocked?
Who turned off the light..?
Why does everything happen to me?
Why is it some of us are here just so that we'll die?
Wow, what a trip!
Yeah, I knew it was dangerous, but I was thinking about the experience points.
Yes! Yes! YES! YES! YY... AAARRRGGGHH!
Yes?
You die...
You got to watch them - be quick or be dead.
You have been dying since the day you were born.
You labeled me, I'll label you, so I dub thee unforgiven.
You maggots make me sick. I'll be avenged. Lucifer dwells within all of us!
You mean I get to use the critical hit chart too?
You will *pay* for this!
You wouldn't dare!
You'd have to be a GOD to smile after that hit!
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too.
You've fallen and can't get up!
You've run out of life.
Your body tries to leave your soul.
Youth, I forgive thee.
Zonk!
You think by killing me tonight my powers will not rise!
There'll be nowhere for you to run when my hatred comes to life!
