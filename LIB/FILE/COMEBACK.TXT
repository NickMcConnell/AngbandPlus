Oh, yeah?
Bite me!
Put your money where your mouth is! 
Eat me!
Just try it!
We'll see about that!
Yeah, right!
You and what army?
Quit bluffing!
Are you going to talk all day?
Well that's just, like, your opinion, man.
Don't make me laugh!
Stop it, I'm getting all misty.
Your mother!
Your grandmother!
I am rubber, you are glue!
Uh, huh. Tell me another one.
Come here. I have something for you...
Act your age!
Back off!
Calm down!
Chill out!
Cool your jets!
Cut it out!
Cut the comedy!
Cut the crap!
Don't blow a fuse!
Don't blow a gasket!
Don't blow your cork!
Don't blow your stack!
Don't blow your top!
Don't blow your wig!
Don't come unglued!
Don't flip your lid!
Don't freak out!
Don't get your bowels in an uproar!
Don't get your nose out of joint!
Don't go aggro on me!
Don't go ballistic!
Don't have a cow, man!
Don't have a kitten!
Don't splinter your toupee!
Easy, champ!
Easy, tiger!
Get back in your box!
Hold your water!
Keep your nose out of this!
Knock it off!
Stop being such a jerk!
Take a Midol!
Take a chill lesson!
Take a chill pill!
Take it down a thousand!
Take it easy!
Be real!
Big deal!
Big hairy deal!
Clean up your act!
Do something constructive with your time!
Get real!
Get serious!
Get with the program!
Have some ambition!
Improve your social life!
Pull your head out!
Read my lips!
Shape up or ship out!
Pull your head out!
You're about as subtle as a charging rhinoceros!
Bend over!
Forget you!
Get stuffed!
Kiss off!
Put it in your ear!
Shove it!
Stick it!
Stick it in your ear!
Stick it where the sun doesn't shine!
Stuff it!
Up thine with turpentine!
Up yours!
You know where you can stick it!
