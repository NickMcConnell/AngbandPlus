You cry, 'Just leave me alone!'
You whimper pathetically.
You cower in fear.
You moan piteously.
You shiver in your boots.
You weep for mommy.
You scream like a woman!
You yell, 'Help me! Help me!'
You groan with fear.
You babble incoherently.
You fall to your knees and grovel!
You scream, 'Mercy!'
'Enough!', you plead.
You scream, 'Not in the face!'
You mumble, 'Oh, woe is me...'
You are too terrified to attack!
You tremble ineffectually.
You beg, 'Don't hurt me!'
