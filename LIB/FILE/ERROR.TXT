What game do you think you are playing anyway?
Aivan sairas kaveri kun tuollaista aikoo puuhata!
Insufficient data for further analysis.
Non sequitur. Your facts are uncoordinated.
Type '?' or '\' for help.
Invalid command.
What?
WHAT?!
You must be out of your mind!
You're killing me.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you know what you are doing?
Aww, come on!
That makes no sense.
I beg your pardon.
Degreelessness mode on.
Degreelessness mode off.
Syntax error.
That doesn't compute.
I don't understand you.
???
Sure. Piece of cake.
Error.
You can't do that!
Help!
Come again?
Sorry?
Sorry, I'm not sure I understand you.
What's your point?
Unknown command.
Command not found.
An unexpected error has occurred because an error of type 42 occurred.
Somehow, you think that would never work.
Welcome to level 42.
Don't be ridiculous!
lfae aierty agnxzcg?
Soyha, azho bouate!
I don't fully understand you.
Why would anybody want to do THAT?
Yes, yes, now tell me about your childhood.
Satisfied?
Something is wrong here.
There's something wrong with YOU.
You leap up 9' and perform a miraculous 5xSpiral in the air.
Aw, shaddap!
Shut up, smartass!
I see little point in doing that.
Oh, really?
Very funny.
You've got to be kidding!
I'm not amused.
I must have misheard you.
Nothing happens.
Where did you learn THAT command?
When all else fails, read the instructions.
Why not read the instructions first?
Cut it out!
Nothing interesting happens.
Just how exactly am I supposed to do THAT?
That's morally wrong and I won't do it.
I'm not gonna take this abuse.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGG!
No more, if you value your character's life!
Give it up, guy.
Disk error. (a)bort, (r)etry, (f)ail?
