=== Options and Effects (GSNband 0.6) ===

Most of the options are accessible through the '=' command, which provides
an interface to the various sets of options available to the player.

In the decriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary
which is shown on the options screen, plus the internal name of the
option in brackets, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref files
to force the option to a given setting, see command.txt for more info.

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including disturb,
(cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are in progress),
flush (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue, including any
macros in progress), fresh (dump any pending output to the screen).


=== Option Set 1 -- User Interface ===

Rogue-like commands    [rogue_like_commands]
    Selects the roguelike command set (see command.txt for info).

Activate quick messages    [quick_messages]
    Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the -more- prompt
    (useful for monster farming).  Allows most keys to mean no to any
    [y/n] prompt.

Prompt for various information    [other_query_flag]
    Forces the game to ask you before taking various actions, such as using
    things which might cause your pack to overflow.  Forces the game to ask
    you which hand to place rings on.

Prompt before picking things up    [carry_query_flag]
    Forces the game to ask you if you want to pick something up when you
    do something that would normally cause the item to be picked up.

Use old target by default    [use_old_target]
    Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the
    current target if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous
    if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

Pick things up by default    [always_pickup]
    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it up.
    Otherwise, you must use the g command, or the - command while walking.
    Combined with carry_query_flag, allows you to selectively pick up all
    items which you step on.

Repeat obvious commands    [always_repeat]
    Tells the game that when you attempt to open a door or chest, bash
    a door, tunnel through walls, or disarm traps or chests, that you
    wish to repeat the command 99 times, or until succesful (see 
    command.txt).

Show dungeon level in feet    [depth_in_feet]
    Display the dungeon depth in feet instead of as an actual level.
    This also affects the monster memory display.

Merge inscriptions when stacking    [stack_force_notes]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty
    inscription and the other does not.  The resulting stack keeps the
    non-empty inscription.

Merge discounts when stacking    [stack_force_costs]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have different
    discounts.  The resulting stack keeps the largest discount.  This option
    may cause you to lose value, but will give you optimal pack usage.

Show labels in object lists    [show_labels]
    Display the labels for objects in the equipment list, and in any
    special window which is displaying the equipment.  These labels
    indicate what the player is using the object for, such as wielding
    or wearing (in a given location).  After you have played for a while,
    this information is no longer useful, and can be annoying.
    Note that in GSNband this option no longer controls
    the plain flavoured object descriptions: a separate option for them
    has been added in the fifth set.

Show weights in object lists    [show_weights]
    Display the weights of objects in the equipment list
    in stores, and in any special window which is displaying any of
    these lists.

Show choices in certain sub-windows    [show_choices]
    Indicate legal choices in special windows which display lists.

Show details in certain sub-windows    [show_details]
    Indicate extra details in special windows, currently used to activate
    the display of death counts and monster descriptions when recalling
    details about a monster.

Audible bell (on errors, etc)    [ring_bell]
    Attempt to make a bell noise when various errors occur.

Use color if possible (slow)    [use_color]
    This option enables the software support for color.  Since this makes
    the game slower, you should always disable this option if you are using
    a machine which is not capable of using color.


=== Option Set 2 -- Disturbance ===

Run past stairs    [find_ignore_stairs]
    Ignore stairs when running.

Run through open doors    [find_ignore_doors]
    Ignore open doors when running.

Run past known corners    [find_cut]
    Cut sharply around known corners when running.  This will result in
    faster running, but may cause you to run into a lurking monster.

Run into potential corners    [find_examine]
    Fully explore potential corners in hallways.

Disturb whenever any monster moves    [disturb_move]
    Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears.
    This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so
    you should probably turn this option off if you want to rest near
    such monsters.

Disturb whenever viewable monster moves    [disturb_near]
    Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any
    monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any
    viewable monster becomes no longer viewable.  This option ignores
    the existence of telepathy for the purpose of determining whether
    a monster is viewable.  See also the view_reduce_view option.

Disturb whenever map panel changes    [disturb_panel]
    This option causes you to be disturbed by the screen scrolling,
    as it does when you get close to the edge of the screen.

Disturb whenever player state changes    [disturb_state]
    This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state
    changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

Disturb whenever boring things happen    [disturb_minor]
    This option causes you to be disturbed by various bring things,
    including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and
    beginning to run out of fuel.

Alert user to critical hitpoints    [alert_hitpoint]
    Produce a bell noise, and flush all pending input, when your hitpoints
    reach the critical point chosen elsewhere, preventing stupid deaths.

Alert user to various failures    [alert_failure]
    Produce a bell noise, and flush all pending input, when various
    failures occur, as described above.


=== Option Set 3 -- Game-play ===

Auto-haggle in stores    [auto_haggle]
    Disable haggling in stores, resulting in a ten percent sales tax
    on items which you would have otherwise been forced to haggle for.
    When this option is on, all prices listed in stores will be the
    actual price that you pay for an item, as opposed to the price
    that the shop-keeper will suggest.

Allow weapons and armor to stack    [stack_allow_items]
    Allow identical weapons and armor to be combined into a stack.  This
    also allows unidentified, but identical, ammo to be combined, which
    may result in the auto-identification of some of the ammo, but which
    makes it a lot easier to actually use unidentified ammo.

Allow wands/staffs/rods to stack    [stack_allow_wands]
    Allow identical wands/staffs/rods to be combined into a stack.  This
    may force the items to be unstacked to use them, which may result
    in overflow of the stack.  Also, the entire stack can be recharged
    (and possibly destroyed) at the same time.

Expand the power of the look command    [expand_look]
    Expand the look command to allow the user to look at grids which
    are not actually in view of the player, allowing the examination of
    objects/monsters which have only been detected by spells, or sensed
    via telepathy.

Expand the power of the list commands    [expand_wrap]
    Expand the listing commands so that they wrap at the edges of
    the appropriate list.  This allows the look and target commands
    to cycle through all appropriate grids forever, and the identify
    symbol to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.

Map remembers all perma-lit grids    [view_perma_grids]
    Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids
    were perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids,
    unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids.  Turning off this option
    allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line
    of sight, but this is better accomplished by the view_bright_lite
    option.  Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player
    are always memorized, and object which is seen by the player is
    memorized independantly from the memorization of the grid itself.

Map remembers all torch-lit grids    [view_torch_grids]
    Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids
    have been explored, but also which ones are dark, because the use
    of this option activates a special color scheme for the display of
    floor grids, in which dark grids are drawn in dark gray, lit
    grids are drawn in white, and (if the view_bright_lite option is
    set) lit grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in orange.
    Note that grids which are currently torch-lit are considered to be
    lit, and are thus drawn in white, unless the view_yellow_lite
    option is set, in which case they are drawn in yellow.

Generate dungeons with aligned rooms    [dungeon_align]
    Force all rooms to be aligned with the panel divisions.  This results
    in a much prettier dungeon, but may result in fewer greater vaults.

Generate dungeons with connected stairs    [dungeon_stair]
    Always generate a staircase back to the level you came from, if you used
    a staircase to get to the level.  This is more realistic, and safer,
    but less of a challenge for some people.

Monsters chase current location (v.slow)    [flow_by_sound]
    Allow monsters to make paths to the player when they are nearby.  This
    option is extremely slow, but can produce viciously smart monsters.

Monsters chase recent locations (v.slow)    [flow_by_smell]
    As above, but also allow monsters to take advantage of old trails
    that you may have left in the dungeon.

Monsters learn from their mistakes    [smart_learn]
    Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to,
    and to use this information to choose the best attacks.

Monsters exploit players weaknesses    [smart_cheat]
    Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to,
    and to use this information to choose the best attacks.


=== Option Set 4 -- Efficiency ===

Reduce lite-radius when running    [view_reduce_lite]
    Reduce the radius of player's lite to that of a torch,
    when the player is running, which makes running more efficient,
    but is extremely annoying.  Certain older versions of Angband used
    this behavior always, so purists should turn it on.

Reduce view-radius in town    [view_reduce_view]
    Reduce the radius of player's view by half when the player
    is in town.  This makes running faster in town, and also allows the
    player to ignore monsters in town which are more than ten grids away,
    which is usually safe, since none have distance attacks.

Avoid checking for user abort    [avoid_abort]
    Avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting
    or running or repeated commands.  This not only makes the game much
    more efficient (on many systems), but also allows the use of certain
    obscure macro sequences, such as turning this option on, resting until
    done, turning this option off, and casting a spell.  Note that the use
    of this option may be dangerous on certain graphic machines.  Resting
    for long periods of time with this option set is dangerous since the
    resting may not stop until the player takes damage from starvation.

Avoid processing special colors    [avoid_other]
    Avoid processing the multi-hued or clear attributes of monsters.
    This will cause all multi-hued monsters to appear violet and all
    clear monsters to appear as white, and will cause trappers and
    lurkers to be visible on some machines, but it may greatly increase
    efficiency especially when telepathy is active.  Certain systems may
    choose to set this option if they are unable to support the special
    color processing, but if they handle graphics correctly, by using
    attr/char pairs with the high bits set, then not only will the game
    correctly avoid using any dangerous color processing, but it will
    allow such processing to occur when it is not dangerous.  So if you
    are using graphics, and you use a normal attr/char for the floor
    grids, then you can use the special lighting effects for floors.

Flush input on various failures    [flush_failure]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
    failures occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand,
    etc.  This is very useful if you use macros which include directional
    components with commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from
    walking towards monsters when your spells fail.

Flush input whenever disturbed    [flush_disturb]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
    character is disturbed.  This is useful if you use macros which take
    time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being
    attacked by a monster.

Flush input before every command    [flush_command]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input before every
    command.  This option is silly, unless you are very paranoid.

Flush output before every command    [fresh_before]
    This option forces the game to flush all output before every command.
    This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game
    somewhat.  Note that this option is only useful when using macros,
    resting, running, or repeating commands, since the outout is always
    flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the user.

Flush output after every command    [fresh_after]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after not only every
    player command, but also after every round of processing monsters and
    objects, which will give you maximal information, but may slow down
    the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on faster machines
    you normally do not have a chance to see the results anyway.

Flush output after every message    [fresh_message]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after every message
    displayed by the game.  This will give you maximal information, but
    may slow down the game somewhat.

Compress messages in savefiles    [compress_savefile]
    Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent messages that
    the player has received.  This can cut the size of the savefile by a
    drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.

Hilite the player with the cursor    [hilite_player]
    Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on some Unix
    machines, but horrible on most graphics machines.  Note that only some
    machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, hiding
    the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.

Use special colors for torch-lit grids    [view_yellow_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for torch-lit grids in
    certain situations (see view_granite_lite and view_special_lite).
    Turning this option off will slightly improve game speed.

Use special colors for 'viewable' grids    [view_bright_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for non viewable grids
    in certain situations (see view_granite_lite and view_special_lite).
    When this option is set, floor grids which are normally drawn in white
    but which are not currently viewable by the player are instead drawn
    in dark gray.  This makes the viewable grids to appear brighter
    than the others, allowing the player to easily determine which floor
    grids are in line of sight.  Turning this option off will probably
    increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for wall grids (slow)    [view_granite_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all wall grids which
    are normally drawn in white (as walls and rubble normally are).  When
    the player is blind, we use dark gray, else if the grid is torch-lit,
    we use yellow (or white) depending on the view_yellow_lite option,
    else if the view_bright_lite option is set, and the grid is not in line
    of sight, or the grid is dark, or the grid is only partially lit, then
    we use gray, otherwise we use the normal white.  Turning this option
    off will probably increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for floor grids (slow)    [view_special_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all floor grids which
    are normally drawn in white (as they normally are).  When the player is
    blind, we use dark gray, else if the grid is torch-lit, we use yellow
    (or white) depending on the view_yellow_lite option, else if the grid
    is dark, we use dark gray, else if the view_bright_lite option is
    set, and the grid is not in line of sight, we use gray, otherwise we
    use the normal white.  Turning this option off will probably increase
    the speed of the game.


=== GSNband Options ===

All features which are typical to GSNband (i.e. which are not in
vanilla Angband) are collected in this menu (except for the Autosave
options).

Disturb whenever random things happen    [disturb_other]
    In GSNband, uncursed teleporting items may teleport you around
    sometimes, asking for your confirmation (and possibly disturbing
    your rest). If you unset this option, they will stop asking you
    and teleporting you randomly. Cursed items will neither ask for
    confirmation nor stop teleporting you even if this option is
    unset.

Get last words when the character dies  [last_words]
    Display a random line from the death.txt file when your character
    dies. If this option is not selected, the You die. message is
    displayed instead.

Allow shopkeepers and uniques to speak  [speak_unique]
    If this option is in use, shopkeepers may sometimes whisper rumours  to
    you. Also certain monsters start boasting as they attack you, and, when
    they die, they say their 'last words'. A speaking monster may also  (if
    the option is selected) be wanted by the law, in which case you get the
    reward if you kill it.

Allow unusually small dungeon levels    [small_levels]
    This option enables the creation of levels of varying sizes. Levels
    that are as small as the town level (i.e. 1 'screen') are possible,
    yet they can be dangerous, especially for a low level character.
    Note that this option has the side effect of enabling / disabling
    'destroyed' levels (they are enabled if small levels are).

Always create unusually small dungeon levels    [always_small_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than
    usual.  See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option above.

Allow empty 'arena' levels      [empty_levels]
    Normal dungeon levels consist mostly of rock. If this option is in
    use, levels which have various terrain as floor instead of solid rock
    may  also be created (somewhat remniscent of Nethack's big-room
    levels). These levels can be extremely deadly, especially with breathing
    monsters (since there are few obstructions to shield). Arena levels
    may have vaults, nests and pits in them like normal levels. Some
    arena levels are dark when they are created, but most are lit.

Allow convoluted and bizarre rooms [fractal_caves]
    Enables fractal caves from a patch by Steven Fuerst. They may be a
    bottleneck in level generation on slower machines, but the results
    are worth it.  This option does not affect special rooms.

Skip mutations in 'C'haracter Display    [skip_mutations]
    Normally, if your character has gained mutations, they will be
    displayed in an extra 'h' mode window under the 'C'haracter Description
    command. Some players may wish to view mutations only via the knowledge
    command ('~' or '|') and do not want any extra screens in the Character
    Description: they should set this option.

Plain object descriptions    [plain_descriptions]
    In GSNband, this option disables full names for identified
    'flavored' objects, in other words, if this option is not in use, an
    identified Potion of Speed could be listed (for example) as a
    Blue Potion of Speed. If you prefer simpler, less verbose
    descriptions, set this option.

Monsters behave stupidly    [stupid_monsters]
    GSNband incorporates Keldon Jones' improved monster Artificial
    Intelligence patch. While this patch most certainly makes monsters
    behave more realistically, they will also be more deadly with the
    improved AI. If you are a sissy, set this option to get the old,
    really stupid monster AI.
    Note that the new AI is a bit processing power expensive. If you have
    an old computer (386sx) and GSNband is running too slowly, you could
    try turning stupid_monsters on. Or buying that Pentium II so you can
    run GSNband :-)

No query to destroy known worthless items    [auto_destroy]
    It can sometimes be annoying that the Destroy command asks for
    confirmation when you are attempting to destroy a broken sword {cursed}.
    If this option is set, no confirmation will be asked if you attempt to
    destroy an object which you know to be worthless. Of course, cursed
    artifacts cannot be destroyed even if this option is set.

Confirm to wear/wield known cursed items    [confirm_wear]
    Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find themselves
    wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this option is set, you
    should be safe from such typing mistakes: you will be prompted if you
    attempt to wear or wield an item your character knows is cursed.

Prompt before exiting a dungeon level    [confirm_stairs]
    Some players (such as myself) often accidentally press the '<' key
    and exit a special feeling level. If this option is set, the program
    asks for confirmation before you go up or down the stairs. Others may
    find the prompt annoying, they should of course not set this option :-)

Disturb when visible pets move    [disturb_pets]
    The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not apply
    to pets: for example, it can be annoying if your rest is always disturbed
    by a pet dog who pops in every now and then. By default, pets do not
    disturb you even if full monster disturbance options are set. If you
    want your pets to disturb you like normal monsters, set this option.

Automatically open doors  [easy_open]
    If this option is set, moving into a grid with a door will try to
    open it (no need to press 'o' and direction)

Automatically disarm traps  [easy_disarm]
    If this option is set, moving into a grid with a trap will try to
    disarm it (no need to press 'D' and direction)

Display floor stacks in lists   [easy_floor]
    Lets you select an item from a stack on the floor by browsing a list,
    Floor stacks are described as 'You see a stack of n items', whenever
    there is more than one item on a floor grid.

Sense items easily              [easy_sense]
    Whenever you pick up an item or look over it from a distance, it will
    be sensed. Usually the sensing will be {?}, but if your character is
    powerful enough they may extract something useful. Light and heavy
    sensing works as usual. Note that using this option will disable
    normal sensing, and therefore you'll have to identify the item you
    failed to sense (well, not always)
    Easy sensing is affected by class, player level, INT and WIS

Allow logging notes to an external file  [make_log]
    Allows you to use the ':' command to log notes about game progress
    to an external file (placed in the save directory). See the description
    of this command for details

Use silly fighting messages  [flavored_attacks]
    Displays silly comments about how you hit a monster, when attacking
    in melee.  Has no effect except for being fun (for a while, at
    least).

Use metric measurements                  [metric]
    Displays item weights and your height/weight in metric units (kilograms/
    centimeters), instead of the English pounds and inches. The conversion
    factor is not very exact, but errors should not be significant.
    
Use special symbols for the player char [player_symbols]
    If on, lets you see your race and class as represented by various
    letters and colors (replacing the default white @)

Display 'equippy' chars                 [equippy_chars]
    This option will show you a graphical representation of your worn
    equipment on the main screen.  The 'equippy' chars will use the
    standard symbols of the respective items.


=== Startup Options ===

While cheating makes the game easier, the following options can make
GSNband harder.  So if you think the game is too easy, or if you want
to impress your friends, then switch on the following options.  The startup-
options can only be accessed while creating a new character (press '='
while creating the character).  There is no way to change their setting after 
the creation is finished!

=== Left Over Information ===

Stat development is maximized  [maximize_mode]
     The preserve flag, if set when the character was created, cancels
     all level feelings of the special variety, but allows missed artifacts to
     be saved by wandering monsters and found again at a later time. This only
     works for non-identified artifacts.

Artifacts are preserved        [preserve_mode]
     The maximize flag, if set when the character was created, causes the race
     and class stat bonuses to be applied as equipment bonuses. This usually
     makes the character harder at the beginning of the game, but easier later
     on, since the stats are no longer limited to a natural value of 18/100.

Use 'vanilla' town without quests and wilderness   [vanilla_town]
    Uses the basic town known from the standard Angband and older versions
    of ZAngband.  This town is only one screen in size and contains only
    the eight basic stores, your home, and the stairs to the dungeon.
    If you use the vanilla town, then there is no wilderness, no special
    buildings and no set quests (but you can still perform random quests).
    This also speeds up the game on slower machines, since the wilderness
    doesn't need to be created.

Auto-scum for good levels    [ironman_auto_scum]
    This option allows you to force the generation of good levels in
    the dungeon. The minimum goodness of the level is based on the
    dungeon level, so the deeper you go, the better the level will be. 
    This means that there are good items on this level, or that the
    level is protected by especially powerful monsters.  In GSNband it
    often is the later, so use this option with care. A lot of people
    consider this option to be cheating.   

Stores are permanently closed   [ironman_shops]
    This option closes all shops.  Try to survive in the deeps of
    the dungeon without supplies from town.

Always create unusually small dungeon levels   [ironman_small_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than
    usual.  See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option above.

Don't allow climbing upwards/recalling    [ironman_downward]
    You are not allowed to climb upwards, or recall to town.  All stairs
    are down stairs and everytime you teleport level, you'll teleport to
    a deeper level.  This option may be dangerous in combination with the
    'small_levels' options, since the creation of the quest-monsters
    may fail on very cramped levels, trapping you on the level with no
    stairs up or down.

Quest monsters get reinforcements   [ironman_hard_quests]
    Using 'hard quests' mode makes the random quests harder, because
    you have to kill all monsters at the same visit to the quest level.
    If you leave the level while some quest monsters are still alive,
    then all killed quest monsters are revived on your next visit.

Allow unfair monsters       [ironman_unfair_monsters]
    Allows or forbids the generation of some monsters that are considered
    unfair at low levels (for example those that cause insanity). However,
    the rewards of taking the risk can be immense... Your score will also
    be raised considerably if this option is on.

Damage other items          [ironman_damage_items]
    Controls whether weapons and armour get damaged with use.  Turning this
    on results in a harder game, but also yields higher score.

Damage artifacts            [ironman_damage_artifacts]
    Controls whether artifacts get damaged with use.  Turning this
    on results in a harder game, but also yields higher score.

Always create empty levels  [ironman_empty_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be an open arena.
    See the 'Allow empty dungeon levels' option above.
    
    
=== Stacking Options ===

In newer official versions of Angband (2.8.2 and higher) items are
'officially' allowed to stack on floors and monsters are allowed to maintain
inventories.  However, the code for both features is already in 2.8.1 (which
GSNband uses, with bug fixes to the stacking code). To enable these features
set the following options:

Allow objects to stack on the floor   [testing_stack]
    Allows a cave grid to hold more than one object (or one kind of object).

Allow monsters to carry objects    [testing_carry]
    If this option is set, monsters which pick up objects will drop the
    objects they were carrying when you kill them. Note that monsters
    which crush objects are not affected by this option.


=== Base Delay Factor ===

The delay_factor value, if non-zero, is used to slow down the game,
which is useful to allow you to observe the animated effects of bolt,
beam, and ball attacks. The actual delay is equal to delay_factor cubed,
in milliseconds.


=== Hitpoint Warning ===

The hitpoint_warn value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal
hitpoints at which the player is warned that he may die. It is also used as
the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.


=== Autosave Options ===

Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not needed
at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which it, to be frank,
probably is not), the user might forget to and his hardware could fail
him. For all of these reasons, you may want to use these options:

Autosave when entering new levels    [autosave_l]
        If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your
        character every time before creating a new dungeon level. Useful
        if you experience hangups in level generation.
	
Timed autosave    [autosave_t]
        If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your
        character every n game turns, where n is the frequency.
        To set frequency press n: it will increase the frequency
        to the next category (and from 25000 to 0), the categories
        being every 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 and
        25000 turns. Note that the frequency must be higher than 0
        and the Timed autosave set to yes for timed autosaves
        to take place.


=== Window Flags ===

Selects what kind of information is displayed in which window. This set of
options only has a meaning if the game is played in a windowed system,
such as a Mac or X Window (XFree86, for example). DOS binaries can also
use windows, but are limited to the first two (Mirror and Recall).


=== Cheating Options ===

Peek into object creation    [cheat_peek]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

Peek into monster creation    [cheat_hear]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at monster creation.

Peek into dungeon creation    [cheat_room]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at room creation.

Peek into something else    [cheat_xtra]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can see debugging messages.

Know complete monster info    [cheat_know]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

Allow player to avoid death    [cheat_live]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.

Allow player to be invulnerable [cheat_invul]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can be immune to HP loss.
