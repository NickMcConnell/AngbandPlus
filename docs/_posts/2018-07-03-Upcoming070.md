[Delays on the Upcoming Release 0.7.0](https://dgolddragon28.github.io/Unangband/2018/07/03/Upcoming070.html)
==============================


My estimated timeline was too optimistic. Because it was my senior year, I spent this spring concerned
almost solely about making sure everything was in order so that I could graduate. Thus, I was unable to
spend significant time on development of Unangband; it is unlikely that I will be able to release 0.7.0
this summer.

All is not forgotten however, and since my graduation in June I have made significant progress on quests,
to the point that at least one added quest ("Destruction of the One Ring") functions properly (in terms of
advancement and effects) in debug mode tests. The next step is to fix the quest description code, which
currently is just broken.

All in all, I hope to release 0.7.0 by the end of this year. As always pull requests are welcome (even though I have
two in limbo - I don't have a system without xfonts, and hence cannot test those properly).
