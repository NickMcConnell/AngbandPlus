Angband-4.1.0-tr ("Angband tragic?") "metapatch"

What is the idea behind this patch?  What makes it a patch instead of a 
variant?

In general, I tried to implement fewer features rather than more, to prefer
simplicity over game balance.  I did not touch any of the game data.
In this way, the code (or pseudo-code) that I wrote might be ported to 
other variants.

This file contains features from the original idea, found here: 
tilde.town/~l_m_standing/nvrl.html, with these 
decisions made: monster kills do give XP, dungeon time also gives XP.
The features are followed by instructions for how to attempt to 
implement them, worked out to greater levels of specification until we get 
practically to the level of a patch file.

Hopefully this will make it easier for people to port this patch to other 
variants.  If not, it will at least help me organize myself.

The Basic Hack

2. Spending time in the dungeon gives XP, greater at greater depths.

4. Let players set avg_xp_wait at character creation

have it print in character dumps

and high scores.


Sorrow

1. If a player kills a monster, they accumulate sorrow.


There are two sorrow variables, apparent sorrow, and hidden sorrow.


Apparent sorrow is what the player sees, both as a number and as messages.


2. If you don't process apparent sorrow, it turns into hidden sorrow.


Very occasionally a message might show up hinting at what lies beneath 
(hidden sorrow)


If hidden sorrow gets high enough, it increases the risk of a shutdown.




3. A "shutdown" takes the form of the player character losing it 


and immediately reading a scroll of Word of Recall (or praying to Eru 
Illuvatar or the appropriate god for kobolds, half-trolls, half-orcs, etc, 
if different, who grants a Word of Recall at lower depths) 


or running up the stairs, 


refusing to leave town, 


and then turning into a town monster.  


Appropriate town monsters for this might be 
the town drunk or battle-scarred veteran, but new ones could be made up 
for this role.


The @ that has now become a t will never go into the dungeon again and can  
never die, but the player has the option of ending the character by 
quitting (which is not referred to as suicide as usual, but rather 
retirement).


New uniques generated based on shut down @s


4. Processing takes the form of passing time in the dungeon or town 
without being in line of sight of a monster.  


Time passes for the player as well as the character, so resting and 
running are disabled.


As time passes, apparent sorrow diminishes to nothing.


Every turn apparent sorrow is 0, there's a certain chance hidden sorrow 
decrements.


5. The amount of sorrow delivered by killing a monster is determined by 
something like ((Morgoth's base XP) / (monster's base XP)) * coefficient
The coefficient is something like (base coefficient) * (monster type 
coefficients)  


7.  You still get a little sorrow for killing Morgoth, but the message you 
get is that "You are at peace".


After you kill Morgoth, all the monsters don't attack anymore, except for 
beings that wouldn't get the memo that the Dark Lord was dead, such as 
molds, mushrooms, animals, etc.


You can no longer incur apparent sorrow, 


and can only kill monsters that would have incurred sorrow below a certain 
threshold.


You can't attack monsters that can't attack you.


8.  There's a third sorrow, deepest sorrow.


Deepest sorrow is hidden and cumulative and increments proportionally to 
both apparent sorrow and hidden sorrow.

(It's signaled with the occasional message such as "You feel melancholy."
"You feel an overall weariness."  "For a moment, there is no future.")

It only starts decrementing after Morgoth dies.


Deepest sorrow doesn't shut you down, but the player has to process their 
deepest sorrow (out of line of sight of monsters; at either the rate of
apparent sorrow or hidden sorrow, depending on tuning) until it's all gone 
before they can complete the game.


Once they are done, they can continue to explore, or retire.


FIRST PASS

Spending time in the dungeon gives XP, greater at greater depths.

1. Find the file where turns are taken.
2. Every turn, run something like the following:
if(rand_int(avg_xp_wait) == 0)
  xp = xp + (xp_of(depth));


Let players set avg_xp_wait at character creation

1. Find the file responsible for character creation.
2. Find where to insert a new dialog option.
3. Add a dialog option saying something like
"XP Wait = ? (higher equals more difficult game)"
4. Store player response in avg_xp_wait, according to how other dialog 
options at character creation time are stored.



have it print in character dumps

1. Find the file responsible for character creation.
2. Find the code for character dumps.
3. Find a place in the dump to put the "XP Wait"
4. add something like
sprintf(dump_str, "XP Wait: %d\n", avg_xp_wait);



and high scores.

1. Find the file that generates high scores.
2. Find the part that generates high scores.
3. Find a place to add "XP Wait: ..."
4. add something like
sprintf(hiscore_str, "XP Wait: %d\n", avg_xp_wait);



If a player kills a monster, they accumulate sorrow.

1. Find the file that handles killing monsters.
2. Find the part where monsters get killed.
3. Perhaps at the point where XP is granted, insert something like:
last_kill_sorrow = kill_sorrow(monster);
ap_sorrow += last_kill_sorrow;
4. kill_sorrow() contains something like this:
convert variables to floating point
sorrow = ((base_xp(Morgoth) * sorrow_coef) / base_xp(monster)) * 
  sorrow_mult(monster);
convert sorrow to integer
return(sorrow);
5. sorrow_mult returns float and multiplies the different multipliers that 
go along with the given monster killed (multipliers greater than or less 
than 1, prob. no greater than 2 or less than 0.1)


There are two sorrow variables, apparent sorrow, and hidden sorrow.  
(Later a third, deepest sorrow)

1. Find the file that initializes player variables.
2. Find the file that defines the player struct or equivalent.
3. Add apparent sorrow (ap_sorrow) and hidden sorrow (hid_sorrow) and 
deepest sorrow (deep_sorrow) to both.


Apparent sorrow is what the player sees, both as a number and as messages.

1. Find the file that draws the screen.
2. Find the part where the screen is drawn.
3. Find a place on the screen for "Sorrow: ..."
4. Add code such as
sprintf(scr_str, "Sorrow: %d", ap_sorrow);

1. Find the file that prints messages.
2. Find the part that decides what message to print.
3. Print a message proportional to last_kill_sorrow.


If you don't process apparent sorrow, it turns into hidden sorrow.

1. Find the file where turns are taken.
2. Find where turns are taken.
3. Add something like
convert variables to float
hid_up_prob = log(fl_ap_sorrow) / AP_BREAKING_PT;  
  /* AP_BREAKING_PT could be 10 (ap_sorrow threshold near 10,000) */
if(hid_up_prob >= 1.0)
  make a special, dire message /* if this is a legal place to do this */
hid_up_prob_int = hid_up_prob * 100
if(rand_int(100) < hid_up_prob_int)
  hid_sorrow++;


Very occasionally a message might show up hinting at what lies beneath
(hidden sorrow)

1. Find the file where turns are taken / where in there turns are taken.
2. Add something like:
if(rand_int(hid_sorrow) > rand_int(OUTCRY_PT)) 
  /* OUTCRY_PT could be 10000 */
 make an appropriate intrusive thought or flashback message


If hidden sorrow gets high enough, it increases the risk of a shutdown.

1. Find the file where turns are taken / where in file.
2. Add something like:
if(rand_int(hid_sorrow) > HID_BREAKING_PT) 
  /* HID_BREAKING_PT could be 1000 */
  init_shutdown();
3. init_shutdown could be something like
message something like "You cry out to Eru Illuvatar to save you from this
life."  "There is an inaudible silence."
execute code from word of recall scroll
set a timer for the turn taker function to trigger in town, later, to 
become_townie()


In town, become a townie.

1. in turn taker function
2. something like
if(townie_timer)
  {
  if(rand_int(300) < townie_timer)
    become_townie();
  townie_timer++;
  }
3. become_townie()
select a random townsfolk identity
does a flashy thing going between @ and t until only t remains
player can press buttons but the t does whatever it will do
after a number of turns, the game is over
display "You live a quiet life in the town, watching others descend to do 
the task that once consumed you."


Processing takes the form of passing time in the dungeon or town
without being in line of sight of a monster.

1. Find where turns are taken
2. Borrow code from resting/running for detecting monsters
3. if resting / running permitted, then decrement ap_sorrow (by 1?  or
a higher number to be determined? maybe it depends on wisdom, xp, con, 
and race?)
4. something like
if(!ap_sorrow)
  hid_sorrow -= (rand_int(HID_RECOVER) == 0);
/* HID_RECOVER could be 1000 */
6. something like
if (Morgoth is dead),
  deep_sorrow -= (deep_decrement() (start with whatever ap_sorrow's
  decrement is));


Time passes for the player as well as the character, so resting and
running are disabled.

1. Find where resting and running occur.
2. Disable them.


You still get a little sorrow for killing Morgoth, but the message you
get is that "You are at peace".

1. Find message code for monster death sorrow messages.
2. Make a special case for Morgoth that says "You are at peace."


After you kill Morgoth, all the monsters don't attack anymore, except for
beings that wouldn't get the memo that the Dark Lord was dead, such as
molds, mushrooms, animals, etc.  But evil is broken, so evil molds (or
animals? can't remember if there are any) become peaceful.

1. Find the code for monster behavior.
2. Add a special case like so:
if(morgoth_dead && (((monster_type != ANIMAL) || (monster_type != MOLD) 
(etc.)) && (monster_type != EVIL))
  set flag for wont_attack in monster struct
3. Find monster struct; add wont_attack flag.
4. In code for monster attack
if(monster.wont_attack)
  ;
  (or in later pass w/ more color, add do_nice_attack(), like bowing, 
  talking, or touching, make messages w/ no other effect)
else
  business as usual


You can no longer incur apparent sorrow,

and can only kill monsters that would have incurred sorrow below a certain
threshold.

1. Find the code for killing monsters.
2. add something like
if(morgoth_dead && (kill_sorrow(monster) > KILL_SORROW_THRESHOLD))
  set flag in monster struct for "can't target, trade places when moving 
  into their tile"
3. Find the monster struct.
4. add a flag for "can't target, trade places when moving into their tile"
5. Find the code for incurring apparent sorrow.
6. add something like
if(!morgoth_dead)
  incur apparent sorrow


You can't attack monsters that can't attack you.

1. Find code for attacking monsters
2. something like
if(morgoth_dead && monster.wont_attack)
  monster.dont_attack = 1;


Deepest sorrow is hidden and cumulative and increments proportionally to  
both apparent sorrow and hidden sorrow.

1. Find the code for taking turns
2. something like
deep_sorrow += (rand_int(DEEP_AP_INC) < ap_sorrow);
  /* DEEP_AP_INC could be 1000 */
deep_sorrow += (rand_int(DEEP_HID_INC) < hid_sorrow);
  /* DEEP_HID_INC could be 100 */


(It's signaled with the occasional message such as "You feel melancholy."
"You feel an overall weariness."  "For a moment, there is no future.")

1. Find the turn taking code.
2. something like
if(!rand_int(50000))
  message "(message appropriate to level of deepest sorrow)"
3. something like
if(morgoth_dead && deep_sorrow == 1)
  { 
  message "You feel a feeling of release.  (You can retire now.)"
  deep_sorrow = 0;
  }
