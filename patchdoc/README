FILES
=====

These are files which document my process in making the patch.  They might
be useful in porting the patch to other versions of Angband or other variants.
TODO: clean them up.

metapatch.txt is the starting place
firstpass.txt is next
execution.txt is next
bugfixes.txt or execution2.txt are next
lastfix.txt is after bugfixes.txt
execution3.txt is next
executionN.txt is last

miscfeatures.txt are some features cut, for now
tr2execution.txt are some features that might show up if I make another 
  version of this
cleanup0.1.txt are changes made for releasing tr 0.1

QUICK GUIDE TO MODIFYING PATCH
==============================

I might have missed a few spots, but I tried to label every change I 
made with a comment with the tag [TR].  If you want a quick and easy
way to make big changes to the game, look in tr-defs.h and tweak the
numbers there.
