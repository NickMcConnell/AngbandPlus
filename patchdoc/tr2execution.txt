Roll back hss code.

There's a player->deep_sorrow in some number TR_LURK_BASE (25000?) chance 
every turn to incur some lurking sorrow (adds a certain amount to
hidden sorrow without increasing apparent sorrow or producing a message).

This way players have a reason to ration their kills.

Also, a ( player->deep_sorrow plus hid_sorrow / TR_HS_DIVISOR ) in 
TR_BALK_BASE chance to balk from making any aggressive move.  (Saying 
"For some reason, you don't feel like doing that.")

Playtesting:
Add a DS (deep sorrow) counter to see what kinds of deep sorrows occur at 
what depths for different playing styles.
