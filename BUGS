BUGS

BUG: Lights are using wrong descriptions?
	- New game. Create with debug option a stick of dynamite. It appears unIDed (e.g. striped) but has the description of a known flare and behaves like one too.
	- "wax candle" gives something with no description 
	- "firecracker" (the next) has the description of a wax candle
	- It's off by 1, is this just the debug mode & is it just lights?
		- A bike helmet generates OK, and so do rings, cards etc.
		- And is the item being known another bug?
	- Note that other flavored items don't have any description besides "It can be drunk" when created by debug option. This is how lights should be.
	- Could it be the object.txt or flavor.txt?
	** May be a dup or related to the following three issues **

BUG: got am item with {??} generated in a store
		- Light, with the rune being "use energy" or "light"?
			- Is this a problem? It's IDed on buying it. Other stuff doesn't behave like that, though...
	e.g. "a tactical flashlight (RTG Mod) (charging) {??}" in the store
		- The same thing can be made up with play-with-object, and it behaves the same way.
		- Also rune-ID fails silently on these objects
		- May only happen on wiz-command generated items

BUG: Tourists' starting sun hat (resLight) isn't rune-IDed
	- That might be reasonable. But the battery the tourist started with is also unIDed. It becomes IDed mysteriously later.
	- Similar symptoms if they start with a wax candle.
		- which is {??}. Wielding doesn't change it. Using an ID card on it produces no message but removes the ??.
	- Is there something about start items (and wiz-command created?), like having no known object, that is different from normal creation?

BUG: Buying a pair of shoes (retro rocket) {??} from a store was locked up in the store.c "Learn flavor, any effect and all the runes" loop.

BUG: "angband: gen-cave.c:2009: town_gen: Assertion `grid.x > 0' failed." (= the x,y are 0, 0.)
	- Can be triggered by Time Lord regeneration putting you in town, but has also been seen entering the town normally by <. 
	** related to the following? **

BUG: Saw climbing the stair into town put me in the middle of the level (not on a store, or the <)

BUG:"You are too heavily loaded to swim" even when not overloaded.
	(well, more accurately you can never swim - you always drown. You should be able to if not loaded, at least for most races.)

BUG: Plurals: knifes vs knives, "13 alkaline battery" not ies.

BUG: After gaining an ability (Sprinting) modifying stats, char-screen and left-panel weren't updated until later (e.g. when changing level)

BUG: Printers all seem to generate with {ignore}
	- can't easily reproduce this

BUG "These two can't intersect"

BUG: m-techniques top label is wonky (move the level 1 to the right, and the cost-label 2 to the left?)

BUG: "When activated, it feeds you for X turns" (on a battery. This isn't really even true for Androids - the 'activated' part)
	- is there an existing way to hide activation descriptions?

BUG: (default) Black Market stocking level should be reduced, because faction can increase it? (I have seen as many as 16 items at init)

BUG: Resists screen is >80 wide (Also, the per-slot stats only label only displays a to l)
	Remove ':' lines?
	Currently the second screen retains the Name..HP and sum-stats blocks. Would removing them help? (A third screen is another option)
	Would want to retain the stat labels if this is done (or move them to the left of the slot-stats)
	This might result in a 3, not 4 column display. Giving 26 not 19 chars (plus the intermediate blanks), enough for a few more in both description and slots.
	But will there end up with more, or less slots? Rings and amulets will disappear. OTOH, a form with more slots might appear...
	Adapting to large terminals is also a possibility, but can't be the only way to play.
	So best to leave alone for now?
	
BUG: tval_is_sharp_missile

BUG: Stone/steel skin timed should be blocked by the mutation (or combined with it in some way)

BUG: At dungeon l127 and l0, able to generate a Massive Iron Crown with acquisition (with INSTA_ART | QUEST_ART)
	- Unable to reproduce (by checking in make_object_named), and artifact probabilities for it are zero.
	- With no generation line (alloc 0) they shouldn't appear... could this have been the old "special artifacts" bug?
	- If so, it's now gone.

BUG?? - In quests, multiplying monsters are handled OK.
	But not newly spawned monsters that happen to be of the same type, or monsters removed through genocide or kill-body - and at least some of that could occur
	and could be fixed, although probably not in any quest currently in use.

BUG? After the success/failure message from a quest, ESC is the only way to get back out.

BUG: When in Giant Form (from a snozzcumber) you can't eat. Or quaff. Quaffing prompts to to change back. (Reasonably for some forms, not really for this - is there a flag? If not, one could be added)
	Eating just says that you don't have any food (wrong!)
	- Base this on OPEN_DOOR/BASH_DOOR flags?
	- There seems to be nothing preventing you staying in giant form. But you do need to eat.
	- There should be a timeout anyway - fast hunger? (Androids can't do this anyway, at least for as long as the only way to take giant form is by eating something)
	- You also can't use shops ("scream"), which is generally OK but it should be possible to use ones you own, or the home! Well, maybe - it depends on the form, and the message is still out.
	- Turn back when below 50% health? And/or a CON check.
	- Or just treat being transformed as another timed counter?
