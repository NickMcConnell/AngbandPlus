0.4.0
A:Implement tables from Halls of Mist
X-Define Feature 
X-Generate on maps 
-Monster jumping modifiers
-Player Jumping skill
-Jumping check to move onto table (but not on table)
-Melee dodge modifier
-Projectile hits table
-Shoot from table edge without problem (from cover)

B:Move Class gen stuff to new c_info.txt file (all in one place, ease adding new skills

C:Halls of Mist-esque dungeon diving
-Upstairs take you back to surface, rename exit
-? Maybe use the up shafts on DL1 with trees and light deeper, as kind of the standard exit
-Rare for upstairs to spawn, Guaranteed upstairs on bottom floor when guardian is defeated.
-Maybe checkpoints every 5 levels with a guaranteed exit (if no guardian) 
-Downstairs let you choose to go 1-3 levels down
-Replace perception with Navigation skill (Mapping?): ranges from 0-100, % chance to generate an exit when you enter a level. If check is passed (exit generated), make another check to detect doors/stairs and another to magic map the area.
-When you enter a dungeon from the surface, or use Word of Recall to recall to it, you can select whether to enter the first floor, halfway down (if you have explored that deep), or the lowest floor you have visited.

D:Reworked skills
-Skills are tiered based on the descriptive names. 
-Spells no longer have custom fails/costs/levels for each class/spell combo, instead the classes have skill ranks of the books they could cast from if its their realm. Beastmaster undead summoning prevention will become a caster flag that either causes the spell to fail or always summons them as hostile

E:Reserving mana
-Persistent buffs: common buffs like blessing, etc no longer have a duration. Instead they reserve (reduce max mana by) their cost (adjusted by duration) and remain up until cancelled (by casting again or through a new command menu to dismiss buffs). Buffs that can't be up all the time (Globe of Invulnerability, Berserk) will still have a duration. Dispelling can still dismiss buffs.
-Scrolls and potions that buff will persist for the current dungeon level, and have a 50% chance to expire whenever you take the stairs or an exit.

F:Summons reworks
-Persistent summons: Summon spells can be either SAFE (failed summon results in no creatures) or PERILOUS (failed summon summons hostile monsters). Summon spells have a limit per spell of the creatures they can summon, and the player will also have an overall limit on pets allowed. Summoning will not work if you are at either cap (and player will be informed and cancel the spell, like trying to walk into a wall). Summons will be thralls (unable to get angry) but will not drop items or give any XP. Summoning spells also reserve mana.
*Example: Sorcery spell "Conjure Elemental" 
-Summons will be able to kill guardians and uniques, even if you're not a Q.
-Charisma affects your total pet limit as well as providing a bonus to the hit and damage of your minions.
-Charming monsters will fall under the total pet limit.
-Add scrolls of Conjure Weapon that summon a mobile deathblade to help you
-Should monster summons work similarly, where they summon one group, or just have a long cooldown on the summoning?

G:Itemization changes
-Clear differentiation between clothing, light armor, and heavy armor. Penalties for wearing too heavy of an armor would include mana % reduction, stealth penalty, etc. Off-hand items (tomes, orbs, etc) would provide a clothing equivalent to shields. Basic gear would be available on the surface, while 
-Two-handed weapons: some weapons will be two-handed, requiring both weapon slots to wield. Giants (and similar) would be able to treat two-handed weapons as one-handed.
-Tiered gear: better
-Instead of getting a single ego, weapons can gain affixes (prefixes and affixes). White items have none, just the base item type. Prefix->Green, Suffix->Blue, Both->gold, etc
-This system would also replace artifacts. Unique properties of artifacts could either be made into affixes or be intrinsic properties of rare base item types.
-Items would be the color of their tier. Or maybe let the player color them based on rules about affixes and level?
-Cursed items would be red and would be very powerful (blue or gold level) but would add misfortune. Misfortune would give a chance to spawn nightmare monsters on levels, which would be extremely dangerous. Higher misfortune counts would allow even more dangerous monsters to spawn.
-Themed chest - chests would be immovable, would generate some items (2d3?) of the same type (a helmet chest, weapon chest, scroll chest, jewelry chest). Chests could be enchanted to give better loot, or could be cursed and summon a pack of monsters when opened, but not dropping any loot for X turns or until you kill the monsters.
-Put digging tools in the light slot and call it the tool slot. Players have a base light radius of 1 (unless they need the dark, like vampires or ninjas, which is added to the light of other items.
-Remove durations on torches and lanterns and greatly increase the cost of lanterns so you don't 1.go to general store 2.buy lantern 3. kill serpent; you have to earn up the money to use it.
-Instead of individual ammo have quivers with charges like devices. Quivers would have ammo type (arrows, seeker quarrels, etc) and capacity. They would slowly refill over time, maybe faster if you walk on a corpse ("you retrieve your arrows). "Bottomless" quivers would have unlimited uses and never need to recharge. Current ego types would still exist - seeker arrow quiver of slay troll, etc
-Some slays are very narrow - orc and troll, for instance. Maybe slay goblinoid would slay goblins, orcs, trolls, and ogres. Bugslayer weapons would slay insects, lice, spiders, scorpions, etc. Dragon, Undead, and Demon slayers are still useful. 
-Brands could create a radius-1 ball effect on a crit, giving multiple brands a use.

H:World Changes
-Wilderness levels when you ">" from the world map.
-A FAAngband world setup, with towns and dungeons separated by wilderness levels. The world map will be visible in knowledge menu, and will closely follow the existing world structure.
-Special scrolls of word of recall would allow you to twist a dungeon, increasing its danger (only while you are there) but also the value of loot generated.
-Add the Flow dungeon from Portralis, which allows you to put an item into a device that generates a random dungeon. You always start on an exit, but taking it will destroy the item. Every 5 (?) floors there will be a room of exits with different flow bonuses that will be applied to the item, letting you pick the result, or a downstairs that lets you continue accumulating power at the risk of greater and greater danger.  Items improved by the flow will be their own color and can only be boosted once.

I:Monster Changes
-gaze attack changes: gaze becomes ranged ability. Floating eyes attack make the player Slowed rather than frozen. Add eyes of destruction with acid gazes, and eyes of annihilation with disintegration gazes. Beholders could split into several eyes on death like how pinl horrors split.
-Ego monsters: occasionally monsters will get affixes as well.
-Add constricting attacks to appropriate snakes and tentacled monsters. Prevents you from moving away, damages each turn. Maybe prevent teleport away, but have a chance to escape if you try to move away (or stand in place if nowhere to move to)
-Add the big bad wolf (break down doors, wind attack (like a tengu?))

J: New Races & Classes
-Add Naga race: good at duel-wielding, poison boost (poison bite attack, poison attacks and spells do more damage), cannot wear shoes. Can constrict enemies (preventing them from leaving after stealing or from fleeing). Tough and stealthy
-Add Elemental Lord class from Portralis
-Add Soul Guardian class from Portralis
-Icky Thing race: Poorer stats but resists poison and acid. Has the symbiosis power from ToME, allowing it to hypnotise immobile creatures and wear them (ride them basically, but you move instead of them). Maybe stealthy since monsters do not fear you.
-Add symbiosis from ToME, as some sort of race that can wear (ride) an immobile create

K: Speed changes
-Split speed into movement speed, blows (melee attack speed), shots (ranged attack speed), casting speed (yellow mages ability, rare otherwise). Monsters will be rebalanced, fast caster monsters will probably be normal move speed but have a casting bonus.

0.3.X
Rejiggered the weapon types, adding a couple of new axes and removing a number of weapons that were outclassed by other weapons of the same type that were better and shallower / less rare.
Removed / replaced *Identify* spells: 
-Archeologists, Lawyers, Filthy Rags, Rings, Deathswords, Samurai, and Weaponmasters all had ID spells that eventually did *ID*, now they just always ID (which is the same as the old *ID*, so a buff anyways).
-Building's Research Item does a regular ID. TODO: Fix costing
-Tourist lost their *ID* class power, they already had a regular ID spell in Arcane that was lower level.
-Nature, Death, and Trump realms only had an *ID* spell, it just became a regular ID spell (again, no debuff as ID is the same as old *ID*).
-Some realms have both ID and *ID* spells, those were replaced with spells from Hengband that I liked but were removed from later versions somewhere along the way: Life spell "Holy Vision" replaced with "Day of the Dove" (LOS charm, life spell from older versions); Sorcery Spell "Identify True" replaced with "Conjure Elemental" (summon E, arcane spell from older versions); Craft spell "Knowledge True" replaced with "Craft Golem" (summon g, craft spell from older version)
-Lore dragon realm's *ID* spell replaced with Alter Reality.


0.2.2
-Fixed bug where bow/xbow/sling proficiency used max for calculating bonuses instead of current
-Fixed weapon proficiency page

0.2.1
-Nerfed dragons back to their previous levels; in Vanilla Angband breath damage is reduced by distance unlike variants so the buff was too much. 
-Restored Mage's ability to change their second magic realm, now via a class power. They can only do this once but they will be able to cast all of the spells in the new realm.
-Fixed Sorcerer starting stat distribution as it still was boosting CHR as if it were the caster stat.
-Ants now come in groups.

0.2.0
-Split the three types of weapons (hafted, polearms, swords) into six: hafted, stave, polearms, axes, swords, daggers+stabby weapons, adding three new weapon TVALS.
-Replaced weapon / skill proficiency system with new system where proficiency is by weapon class (TVAL; weaponmaster choices) instead of individual weapon types.
-NOTE: May need to revisit the max proficiency / monster level thresholds. In any case playtesting is needed to check proficiency growth rates
Question: Should whips be moved to tools (diggers, etc)?
-Removed spell proficiency system. Encouraged casting spells over and over again in safe spaces to build up proficiencies. Effectively everyone is now at Expert proficiency in their spells.
-Restored books of Kendo, fixing problem with skillmasters where they could gain skill in Kendo but couldn't actually use it without books. Samurai are now book casters for now.
-Chaos patron is now preserved for quick-starting from dead character's save files.

0.1.X
-Forked from FrogComposband 7.1.Chocolate
-Changed variant name to Oposband and version to 0.1.0
-Removed many unnessary if_savefile_older_than calls as we won't be converting those
-Removed 18/* notation for stats. Old 18/10 is now just 19, 18/100 is 28, 18/*** is 40, etc
-Adjust many Charisma values to pre-PosChengband values.
-Fear saves now work off of best of Strength and Charisma, to make strong but poor CHR monsters like zombies and balrogs better at fear.
-Identify acts as *Identify* and the latter is being phased out
-Psuedo-ID items on walkover, and Average/Good items IDed on walkover.
-Sorceror reverted to using INT for casting. CHR was thrown in because DND sorceror's are CHR-casters, but they are a completely different creature from the Zangband sorceror, who is just an uber-mage. Sorceror INT now +6 and CHR now -2
-Added Hexblade and Chaos Mage from Composbad
-Removed Chaotic personality, chaos patrons are reserved for the two chaos classes.
-Many monsters are more affected by doors than before: felines, dragon flies, canines, snakes, and ants
-Reversed pack AI settings for animals and sentient beings, so the latter will try to lure healthy players into rooms while the latter will hunt you down. Idea from Sil
-Player now receives full HP and SP restore when levelling up
-Objects now have a single attack plus instead of split to-hit and to-dam values. Generally to_h was always much less important than to_d to players and having them different (and randomly rolled) just made stacking ammo, etc harder.  Scrolls of enchant to-hit and enchant to-dam have been replaced with a single Enchant Weapon scroll.
-Can now create new characters or load savefiles with keystrokes from news screen, without having to use the File menu. High scores list viewing has been moved to this screen as well.
-Streamlined character creation by compressing screens to character creation. Removed beginner mode and moved normal/monster mode selection to the race/class UI, so you can easily switch between them. 
-Prayer class group had a single class, Priest, and even when the alternative priest class, Disciple, was added it wasn't put there. So Priest has been moved to the Magic class group and Prayer group has been removed.
-Orc shamans now have SP like other casters. I see no reason for them to use HP to cast.
-Needless opaque and polemical no_chris option renamed no_nexus_warp
-Removed some unneeded options 
	preserve_artifacts - Artifacts always give a special feeling in FrogComposband, removing main advantage of no_preserve.
	empty_lore - just use a new savefile. With full monster knowledge no downside other than quickstart.
	allow_friendly_mons - minor feature that does not need to be allowed. Just attack friendly monsters to make them hostile.
	allow_hostile_monst - integral feature that does not need to be toggled
	allow_pets - Integral feature that does not need to be toggled
	allow_spoilers - moved to debug command z.  
-Changed the display of weapons bonuses to be more similar to armor displays: From "Dagger (1d5) (+0,+0)" to "Dagger(1d5,+0)."
-Re-Added the Blue Mage and Imitator classes from Hengband, which had been removed with the monster spell revamp in Poschengband 7.0
-Added many monsters from Vanilla
-Buffed dragons (hp, ac, and melee) and moved deeper / increased xp, based on Vanilla 4.2.0 levels. Also added great wyrms for the missing elemental types.
-Added Greater elementals: take earth/air/fire/water elemental, move twice as deep and boost HP/AC/speed and damage.
-Player elemental characters get a thematic reward from the thieves quest (a magical version of their starting weapon)
-Player life rating now stored as a number, and player_hp array replaced with a simple hp= 5 + (5 * level * life_rating / 100). Older savefiles will be converted;
-Samurai gain their spell attacks as they level, and no longer need to learn their spells from books. Books of Kendo nhave been removed
-Most book casters no longer need to learn spells, they can just cast any from their books they are high enough level for. Gray Mages and Rage Mages still learn spells due to their unique mechanics.
-'C'haracter display now lists the percentage of physical damage reduction from AC.
-Players receive a full HP/SP restore upon levelling up, like in many other games. Could be a birth option but there are so many alreay. Mostly it allows more extended fighting in the early levels when level ups come frequently.
-Added many monsters from Vanilla Angband 4.2.X
-First town renamed Rampart (from Omega) - Outpost was always a silly name
-Can now see/browse what race/class powers the character will get at what level.
-Increase min/max depths of the Dragon Lair to put Great Wyrms of Law/Chaos/Balance back in-depth (Ster)
-Removed summoning spells from Ancient Dragons & Great Wyrms that don't summon in other PCBs (Wobbley & Ster)
-Added Great Wyrms for Bronze, Silver and Gold dragons (Perplexity, Procrastination, and Dissonance, respectively).
-Added Chaos Patrons from Composband, along with ability to select a patron at character birth
-Added links to Chaos Patron helpfile in Chaos-Warrior and Chaos-Mage descriptions in Classes.txt helpfile.
-New ego lantern: of the Third Eye, gives telepathy and resist blindness (too strong? maybe telepathy is enough?), native to DL80. Based on suggestion for Vanilla Angband by Derakon.

INVESTIGATE - learn how this works
REWRITE - rewrite to make it work

TODO
-EXPERIMENTAL: Only race affects XP gain. Not shown in character creation yet, just in XP calculations.
-Elite monsters with random prefix/suffix.
-Randomized Challenge Dungeons with random alterations (faster monsters, fire damage every turn, darkness, random teleportation, corpses revive, etc)
-Buff spells that can be maintained indefinitely (due to low costs and/or non-brokenness, plus not having some issue when they expire, like invulnerability's loss of actions) don't have a duration but instead just reserve mana and stay active. Reserved mana reduces your current max SP, so a lot of buffs mean little to no mana for casting.
-Add elemental lord from Portralis
-Merge Weaponmaster's ranged weapon specialties into Archer class, and melee/shield specialties into Warrior.
-Add or merge vanilla's new necromancer into poschangeband necromancer.
-Add Vanilla's new Druid and shapeshifting class?
-Change stealth mechanic to affect monster awareness of the player. So high stealth players would appear and disappear to monsters, making taking on a group more manageable as more distant ones are less likely to be able to see you to engage.
-Should speed just be move speed?
-Add group ID to objects, and make weapon proficiencies based on group. Groups could be as simple as weaponmaster specialties, or more specific.
-Make beastmasters inability to summon ghosts be a class-specific code, where summoning them always results in hostiles.
-Caster level mechanic (merge into spell power?). 0 for non-casters or non-realms, =level for primary realm, worse for hybrid casters (who count as several levels lower for spell learning), etc
-Merge rod effects into wands and staves, then rebrand staves rods. Expand the wizardstaff to be like the MageStaff from ToME (extra mana, extra caster level/spell power,decreased mana usage,mana regen, etc)
-Split HP and SP regeneration (reinvigoration or something).
-Gray Mages could be changed to be able to learn a certain set of spell books.
-New class: Druid. A nature caster with a class power to summon animal pets who is good at riding.
