This is a document file listing the changes in Zangband (compared to the
standard Angband 2.8.1.) No long explanations, just a list. See code for
details. In reversed chronological order (more or less):

ZAngband 2.1.1c
-Fixed the 16x16 tile for hobbit characters. A beer mug is fitting for
 a hobbit, but it was still a bug. ;-)
-Fixed another bug in the creation of quest levels.
-Allowed all characters created in pre 2.1.1 versions of ZAngband to
 choose the number of quests when loading the savegame. You may have to
 leave and reenter the current level, if it's a quest level.
-Only Uniques will now resist disintegration effects.
-The last questmonster now drops all carried items, the normal monster
 drop and one reward item when you finish the quest.
-Reward drops are no longer added to the monster knowledge.
-Fixed the problem with the transparent color of the 8x8 bitmap.

ZAngband 2.1.1b
-Quest message pluralization fixed (again).
-No more extremely out of depth quests for new characters.
-Desintegration spells like "Fist of force" can destroy walls.
-Reflection works now.
-Corrected the new tiles for spirit naga, angel, and blue jellies.
-Creation of artifact arrows/bolts/shots with scrolls of artifact creation
 is allowed again.

ZAngband 2.1.1
-Paralysis attacks on a paralyzed player always do at least one hp of damage.
 This should prevent "infinite paralysis" from floating eyes.
-Fixed some bugs in the autosaving code.
-Fixed a bug in the monster-AI code.
-Added circular rooms from Dag Arneson Ying-YAngband.
-Fixed a bug that allowed the creation of artifact-arrows, -bolts, and -shots
 with scrolls of artifact creation.
-Adam Bolt's tiles are now finished and every monster/object/spell effect has a tile.
-Another bug in the quest code fixed.
-Quest messages are now correctly pluralized.
-The roguelike commands to show game time (the ' key) and to activate the racial
 power/mutation (the O key) work now.
-Benny S. Hofmann's patch to the windows version allows switching between ASCII,
 old tiles and Adam Bolt's tiles.
-Toned down the TY-curse a bit.

ZAngband 2.1.1 beta 2
-Updated Adam Bolt's terrain tiles again.
-Implemented the item flavoring code from Angband 2.8.3.
-Fixed a bug in the macro-creation.
-Fixed a bug creation of the quest levels.


ZAngband 2.1.1 beta 1
-Updated Adam Bolt's terrain tiles.
-Mindcrafter powers are correctly displayed in the spell-list window
 and don't crash the game anymore.
-Fixed a bug in the random activations of the mutations, the
 effects appear less often now.
-The main-win.c file is now ready for compiling with Adam Bolt's
 new tiles. Just define "USE_AB_TILES" and compile it.
 The windows version also supports transparency and the
 "double-step bug" is fixed.
-Added a sound-event for the "Hitpoint Warning".
-Pets will no longer pick up/destroy items.
-Implemented Greg Harvey's patch that adds the macro code from 2.8.3.
-Added Heino Vander Sanden's QAngband quest code with big help from
 Dean Anderson.

-Fixed some bugs with the new bookstore and the store maintainance and
 owner shuffling works for the bookstore.
-Fixed the problem with compiling the main.c file on Unix/Linux systems.


Zangband 2.1.0d
-Silas Dunsmore's cumulative light radius patch added.
 Any object in your equipment that has the 'glow' flag will extend your
 lit-area radius by 1, up to a maximum of 5.  The normal light-source
 objects still work the same, but glowing artifacts and helms of light
 are actually useful.
-Added a bookstore to the town to free up space in the magic shop.
-Fixed problems with the Summon Demon (Chaos), Raise Death (Death),
 Phantasmal Servant (Trump), Mindwave, and Adrenaline (Mindcraft)
 spells on systems without mathematical coprocessor.
-Chaos Warriors are no longer hurt (or killed) by the "strain of
 casting (Mass) Genocide" when the chaos patron casts the Genocide
 spell ("Let me relieve thee of thine oppressors!").
-Fixed a bug with the sound-effects, the correct effects will be
 played now.
-Added new sound-events for buying and selling in stores.
-Added support for Adam Bolt's new tile-graphics, transparency-
 and lighting-effects, MOD-, and S3M-files to the DOS version.
 Adam Bolt's tiles for ZAngband are not yet finished, most of the
 ZAngband specific monsters are displayed with other tiles or with
 ASCII-characters.
 The special DOS options can be accessed by pressing ! while playing.

        * Your own inscriptions should not be junked if an item becomes cursed

        * Maybe weapons of slay xxx should glow if xxx is nearby? (option)
        * Bug? Eldritch horrors seen first via ESP don't blast your sanity?
        * Disintegration balls can explode out-of-bounds?
        * Add oriental melee weapons for monks (nunchaku, bo stick etc.)
        * Smashed potions should also affect the player (if withing range)
