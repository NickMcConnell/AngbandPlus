This version of Kamband supports Tom Morton's BigScreen Patch,
which allows you to have a terminal larger than 80x24. When the
main terminal is at least 26 rows tall, two extra rows of status
messages appear at the bottom.

How to change the terminal size
===============================
You can only change the size of the main terminal before starting
the game.

On MS Windows
-------------
Change the NumCols and NumRows entries in the ANGBAND.INI file.
NumCols must be greater or equal to 80. NumRows must be greater 
or equal to 24.

On other platforms
------------------
Pass "-y rows" and "-x cols" options on the command line.
