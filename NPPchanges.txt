Version 0.3.1

New features:
Notices of failed quests are written to the notes file.
Potions of life and *healing* can occasionally be good items if the 
	object level is greater than 80.
Made objects in inventory slightly harder to destroy, to compensate
	for all the extra chances they have to get 
	destroyed with the 4gai changes.
Changed the probability of monster description displaying spell frequency.
Re-charging a stack of wands doesn't destroy the whole stack as frequently.
Failing to steal too much only makes newly generated monsters slightly hasted (since
4gai has code to slow down completely hasted monsters).  It also now makes them wary.
(I)nspecting a weapon now also reveals how many attacks per round the 
	character would get with that weapon.
Made potions of augmentation and dungeon spellbooks slightly more
	probable as tailored quest rewards.
Added new icon, made by John Tannert.
Using '~' to view home inventory gives object description as well.


Fixed Bugs:

Bugfix: Sleeping, evasive monsters no longer get a chance to evade a blow.
Bugfix: Shafts can appear above level 5 now.
Bugfix: Boosted damage sides no longer get erased when a savefile is loaded.

Version 0.3.0

New features:

Added Demoband/Sangband 4gai, which includes (as done by Leon Marrick):
- The "basic code":  4GAI monster ranges, spellcasting, learning, 
  mana and spellpower, movement, flow, processing, terrain-handling.
- The "associated code":  Oangband-style noise, monster spells, multi-hued 
  monsters, fewer wimpy monsters, monster polymorphing, compacting, etc.
- EyAngband-style monster lifepoint ratings  (by Eytan Zwieg)
- Sangband-style monster melee attack code and town monsters, 
  various Sangband updates to the above, 
- Some changes to randomizing functions to accomodate the above, more correct rounding
- New and more varied monster attack messages, some from Moria and early Angband
- smaller monster groups and escorts, careful control of nests, pits, and similar
- new limits on summoning level, much fewer monsters summoned
- new limits on OoD monsters, whether randomly generated, summoned, or placed in vaults.
- arc spells and breaths for the monsters.
- Sangband project functions (this means no more hockey-stick corridors)
- Sangband update_view and line-of-sight functions
- many new types of monster resistances
- Evasive Monsters (Sangband, EYAngband)
- monsters surrounded by clouds (UnAngband, Sangband)
- True "Mimics" (Zangband, Sangband)


Note: The breath spells still do Angband-type damage, based on hitpoints rather than spell power.
And have about the same maximums as Angband.  I made some minor changes to some breaths, such as 
gravity, inertia, and time.  Example:  depending on whether the creature breathes powerfully or 
not, gravity breath has different maximum HP damage, and the breath damage-per-hp is also different.
This allows gravity wyrms to do some real damage while slightly reducing the danger from gravity hounds.
Instead of reducing HP and armor class as Sangband/Oangband do, the monsters have a smaller
amount of max_mana, and spell power is adjusted so the damage is similar to that by Angband
Monsters.  They do more damage in some spells than Angband, but I made the sources of healing
a little more common and just a little more powerful to compensate.

Other minor new features:
Player given chance to add last words to notes file upon dying.
Made most sources healing a little more powerful and common.
Made scrolls of mass banishment and banishment more common.
Limited the types of creatures available for quests (no insects, flies, rodents, etc...)
The "make monsters wary" code now works better, as it is based on the project functions.
Got rid of the monster.pkg and associated monster-lua files.  
   The other lua files are still working.
Added monster mana bar to go with the monster hit-point bar.
Changed name of staffs and rods of enlightenment to magic mapping.
Added several new potions and potion flavors.
Added separate commands for stealing (P) and setting traps (O)
aborting the alter trap command no longer takes a turn
slightly revised character screen
removed unused monster options
Made monster spell frequency based on straight percentages rather than the one_in_X scheme
Removed option to occasionally go down another flight of stairs
Added shafts in addition to stairs, which take the player up or down 2 levels.
Made some of the more valuable rods immune to destruction by electricity.
When re-charging, a single rod can no longer be destroyed.
In the knowledge screen, player can now view notes file 
	and home inventory (code provided by Jean-Pierre Hamel)
Made it slightly more likely to sleep, confuse, and slow monsters.
Some potions have affect the monster when thrown (ex. potion of confusion confuses monster)
Two prayer changes in beginners handbook:
1)  Combined find traps and detect doors/stairs into one spell.
2)  Added a weak, low-level attack spell, bolt of draining.

      dropped on the floor outside the Guild.

Fixed Bugs:

Bugfix:  The startup screen referred to a help file that no longer existed.
Bugfix:  Separated recall depth from max depth.  This was messing
         up the quest generation code.

get additional to-hit and to-dam when throwing well-balanced weapons
unusually higher chance to hit sleeping monster
ability to set traps, set advanced monster traps, and steal items

/*warning, failing to steal has some very negative consequences*/

Made the JLE ego items and amulets a little weaker.
Added Leon Marrick's modified help files and re-edited them for NPPAngband.
Added throwing weapons and well balanced weapons.  They are easier to hit with & 
they do extra damage.
Players start with equipment wielded.
Took interactive startup menus from EYAngband.

deeper.

Players don't use full energy if they use less than max# of attacks
to kill a monster.
Modified the file dump to include a chart of resist flags, stat increases and 
sustains due to equipment.

Chance of avoiding theft not 100% until dex is 18/180.

(ex. a player who is immune to cold will not get message "you feel more
 resistant to cold" when they quaff a potion of resist cold)

SCthAngband.
Added some uber-flags (ex...im_elem, no_charm, drop_up_to_14 items)

The stun counter stops increasing when a player is knocked out, so players

Version 0.1.0 

*	Added support for describing monsters speed at +5 (somewhat quickly), +15 
(exceedingly quickly), and +25 (extremely quickly). 
*	Added patch to change player's color as their hit-points drop. This is an 
option 
found under "display options". 
*	Increased chance of increased damage dice and to hit dice on weapons, and 
increased changes in increased damage dice on ammunition. 
*	Decreased level boost from dragon scale mail to +10. 
*	Reduced level boost from powerful amulets to +10. 
*	Amulets & spell books are generated as a guaranteed "good" only if out of 
depth. 
*	Added option to go up or down additional flight of stairs some of the time 
(from 
Oangband). 
*	Added "themed chests", similar to Oangband. There are 16 themes, and may 
frequently contain guaranteed good or great objects. 
*	Chests now increase level rating by +5. 
*	Added different templates for "great items" rather than good items. There 
are 
several things in the good list aren't in the great list (such as spellbooks).   
*	Changed the object generation code so that the "great" flag no longer 
needs the 
"good" flag to produce a great item. The "great" flag without the "good" flag 
will 
produce a great item, but it only gets one chance instead of four to become an 
artifact. This was done as a way to keep the new style chests from becoming too 
powerful. 
*	Added Dr. Whites Monster Lite patch. 
*	Added Eytan Zwieg's vault flipping patch. 
*	Added a note taking patch, this is a birth option (birth_take_notes), and 
needs to be 
specified before the character is started. I did a significant re-write of this 
patch. 
Comments can be written to a file, and they will automatically print out in a 
character dump. In addition, it automatically records the turn, level of char, 
and 
dungeon level of certain events, such as: the killing of uniques, finding of 
artifacts, 
and greater vaults created, when a player is killed or wins the game, and every 
time 
the character gains a new level, but only if it is divisible by 5 (level 5, 10, 
15, 20, 
etc…). These notes automatically print out with the character dump. The 
formatting 
on this feature isn't perfect yet, but I plan on finishing it after I 
incorporate 
EYAngband's resistance system. 
*	Added rod-wand-stacking based on Oangband 0.6.0. 
*	Reduced delay when using the autoroller to create a character. Should be 
10 times 
faster. 
*	Added DarkGod's html screen dump patch. 
*	Dropped Items may now be specified by theme. Code is mostly in place to 
create 
themed monster drops. Currently, the themed drops are used in chest opening & 
vault creation (chests w/ monster 40 levels OOD).  
*	Added the autosquelch patch. I made some minor changes to the sub-quality 
squelching menu. For rings and amulets, there are only three levels (none, 
cursed, 
and all but artifact). I also added in the option to automatically squelch 
chests after 
they are opened.
 
*	I deliberately made almost no changes to the edit files, so the first 
version will give 
almost the the exact same playability as Angband v 3.0.3. with some nice options 
that Angband, IMHO, should contain, such as rod/wand stacking, screen dumps 
and autosquelch. The only changes in the edit files are:
*  Added rods re-charge time to the PVAL flag (without this updated file, the 
game WILL crash almost instantly due to divide by zero errors) 
*  Increased the rarity of chests, to compensate for them being loaded with 
so many good & great items 
*  Added the has_lite flag to the appropriate creatures, so the Lite Patch will 
work 
*  Removed the good flag from many of the creatures who have the great 
flag, to balance out all the great items that are now in the chests. Mostly only 
those who got the great flag added in the JLE-patch. 
*  Modified some of the greater vaults so they include chests in certain areas. 
*  Five new types of monster vaults and pits. The ogre pits are a little bland 
right now. I plan on adding more types of Ogres, but I am deliberately 
holding that until the next version of NPP Angband so this one keeps as 
close as possible to 100% Angband 3.0.3 playability. 

*  Six new types of monster vaults and pits. The ogre pits are a little bland 
right 
now. I plan on adding more types of Ogres, but I am deliberately holding that 
until 
the next version of NPP Angband so this one keeps as close as possible to 100% 
Angband 3.0.3 playability. 
*  There is a minimum depth enforcer when selecting the type of Monster Pit or 
Next, so the weaker ones, such as Jelly Pits, don't appear at higher depths. 
.
