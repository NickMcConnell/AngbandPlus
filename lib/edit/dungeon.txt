# === Understanding dungeon.txt ===

# Format:
# N: dungeon number: abbreviated dungeon name
# X: easily connected to these dungeons (up to 4)
# L: level : base terrain : fill with terrain : big terrain : small terrain : quest monster : vault : special level : flags : level name prefix
# Q: dungeon connected to once quest monster defeated : quest monster
# Y: lock all shops until this monster is defeated : if player has visited this dungeon
# Z: substitute this dungeon instead : if player has visited this dungeon
# W: substitute this guardian monster for guardian of zone 0, even if no guardian till now: if player has visited this dungeon (warning, Q: and Y: guardians are always unchanged)
# G: generate monsters with this character
# R: generate monsters with this flag
# S: store1 : store2 : store3 : store4 : store5 : store6 : store7 : store8
# D: description, the shorter the better
# F: flags
# A: generate allies with this char: generate allies with this flag

# Note store 1 - 8 are now the index of the feature in terrain.txt not the store in store.txt.
# The 'power' of the feature determines which store to reference. So you can theoretically
# put any feature here you want.

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Full name of the dungeon is obtained
# by concatenating the name of the first level and the abbreviated dungeon name.

# 'X' indicates the dungeons that may be reached from this dungeon.

# 'L' defines dungeon 'zones'. A dungeon zone extends from the level listed until 1 below
# the next level listed. Zones must be shown in increasing order of level. The last L:
# entry defines the maximum depth of the dungeon. The first L: entry defines the 'surface level'
# of the dungeon and apparent depth is determined as offsets from this surface level. Full name of the level is obtained
# by concatenating the level name prefix and the abbreviated dungeon name.

# The quest monster must be a unique. The vault indicates an entry in the vault.txt file
# and places the vault in the centre of the level, but without any monsters, traps or treasure.

# 'G' indicates that all 'wandering' monsters on the level will be this char.

# 'R' indicates that all 'wandering' monsters on the level will have this flag. Acts as an
# either/or with the 'G' entry.

# 'S' indicates up to 8 stores that are placed on the level with
# the fill with terrain 0 tag.

# 'D' indicates the description displayed on the surface of the dungeon.

# TODO: play-test if the guardians are similarly powerful as uniques
# of the level they appear in, with few exceptions, e.g. Caradhras, Maggot
# (mark the exception in comments above dungeon definitions)

# TODO: change the tone of some descriptions (mine, by mikon:) from modern 
# to high fantasy. Think: Tolkien, both The Hobbit 
# (less serious but still not modern) and LOTR (mostly deadly serious, 
# very elegant, archaic, biblical at places).
# Also make them correct English and more subtle wrt. psychology and plot.
# Current text is mostly flavour, plot ideas and justification for
# purely game-play decisions, chaotically collected from The Hobbit and the net

# TODO: finish level names and fit level design to level names


# The non-existent dungeon.
# The non-campaign start is the second to last dungeon.
