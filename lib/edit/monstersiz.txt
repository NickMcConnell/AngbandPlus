# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : armor class : size
# V: vision : alertness : spell range
# W: depth : rarity : monster stealth : experience for kill
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Black        W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# (note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and
# thus the monster will appear to be an empty black space if its
# color is "d".)

# 'I' is for information - speed, hit points, armor class, and size.
# Size combined with monster stealth affects how easily you notice the
# monster. 4 = human size.  Anything size 6 or larger will always be noticed
# in a lit room, even if it is on the opposite end of a large room.

# 'V' is for vision ranges - vision is the maximum distance you can be
# from the monster for it to notice you, alertness is how easily it notices you:
# 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 254 (prefers to ignore intruders) or
# 255 (non-aggresive; doesn't attack unless attacked).
# Spell range (new) is the maximum distance you can be from the monster
# to be affected by its spells. If the monster has no spells, I put a
# range for what it would be if the monster did have spells.

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, and experience for
# killing. The third slot is for monster stealth.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
# from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
# damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
# number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
# one of its spells. X must not be zero. If X is 1, the monster will
# never move while the player is in sight, and will thus never attack
# in melee, as it will cast spells every turn: if the monster is to use
# a melee attack, then X must be 2 or greater.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster.

# === Understanding monster.txt flags ===

# UNIQUE monsters are just "special" monster races, with the requirement
# that only one monster of that race can exist at a time, and when it is
# killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters appear the same color as the floor, terrain feature or
# object underneath them.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters are "multi-hued" - they change color, every player turn.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters are totally invisible: the symbol shown on the screen
# is the same as the floor (or other terrain feature) below it, or the item
# that is lying on that floor. These monsters can currently be targetted as
# normal monsters: perhaps this can be changed so that the player must KNOW
# the monster is there (by bumping into it, or having the monster wake up
# and attack the player?)

# CHAR_MULTI monsters are those which look like objects, and use the symbols
# of objects. They are in plain sight, but the character should not know that
# a monster is there. At the moment, such monsters can be targetted normally
# (which means that this flag currently has no effect), but this may change
# in the future, as with CHAR_CLEAR monsters.

# (Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see... if you "l"ook
# for them, you will find them unless they are invisible and you cannot
# see invisible, and if you use the * command for targetting mode you
# can pick them as a target.)

# ToDo: Explain the other monster and spell flags.  But maybe in another file.

# Complete monster flag explainations:

# UNIQUE - there is only one of this monster
# QUESTOR - must kill this monster to get to the next level and win the game (Sauron & Morgoth only)
# MALE / FEMALE - changes pronouns used in game with no other effect.
# CHAR_CLEAR - monster uses the symbol (character) of whatever is under it.
# CHAR_MULTI - is detected as an object (or wall) until you discern that it is a monster. This
# means that detect monsters usually will not detect it unless you have found that it is a monster.
#    note: any monsters with this flag should probably have EMPTY_MIND or at least WEIRD_MIND
#	or they will be easy to detect with telepathy, and the point of CHAR_MULTI is that they're
#	very hard to detect. All wall monsters with CHAR_MULTI should have BLOCK_LOS.
#	NEVER_MOVE is not nessesary since they will rarely move while disguised anyway.
# ATTR_CLEAR - monster uses the color of whatever is under it.
# ATTR_MULTI - monster changes color (multi-hued)
# FORCE_DEPTH - monster never appears before its native depth.
# FORCE_MAXHP - monster always starts with max HP for its race
# FORCE_SLEEP - monster never takes the first turn when it's generated (for monsters with ranged 
#  attacks).  (Has nothing to do with the monster being asleep)
# FRIEND - normally appears in pairs (rarely used)
# FRIENDS - normally appears in groups
# FRIEND1 - normally appears in smaller groups
# ESCORT - normally appears with escorts (weaker monsters using the same symbol)
# ESCORT1 - normally appears with less escorts
# ESCORTS - every monster generated as its escort gets the FRIENDS flag added.
# NEVER_BLOW - monster has no melee attacks
# NEVER_MOVE - monster never moves (except for possible BLINK and TPORT spells)
# RAND_25 / RAND_50 - monster moves randomly 25/50/75% of the time
# ONLY_GOLD - monster only drops gold, no items
# ONLY_ITEM - monster only drops objects, never gold
# DROP_30 / DROP_60 / DROP_90 - monster has 33/60/90% chance of dropping a treasure
# DROP_1D2 / DROP_2D2 / DROP_3D2 / DROP_4D2 - monster drops Xd2 treasures
# (all drop flags are added together for the monster's total drop)
# DROP_GOOD / DROP_GREAT - monster is much more likely to drop good stuff (egos, artifacts, etc)
# DROP_CHOSEN - flag to make Morgoth drop his special artifacts GROND and his iron crown
# STUPID - monster never uses ai_smart advantages, various other minor effects.
# SMART - monster chooses its spells intelligently, various other minor effects.
# INVISIBLE - monster is invisible
# MONGLOW - monster gives off its own light.
# EMPTY_MIND - not detected by telepathy
# WEIRD_MIND - rarely detected by telepathy
# MULTIPLY - monster multiplies itself
# REGENERATE - monster's hit points regenerate faster
# RETURNS - monster returns from the dead
# POWERFUL - widens radius of breath, gives possibility of bypassing sustains with stat drain
#  attacks, and partial damage through immunity with elemental melee attacks. Saving throw
#  against its spells is harder.  Plus a couple other minor effects.
# BR_WEAK - its breath does less damage.
# BR_STRONG - its breath does just as much damage as breath weapons in V (otherwise a little less).
#  All Ds and most other big breathers should have BR_STRONG.
# FLY - (only if not too big to fly between the rubble and the ceiling, so D's don't get this flag)
# OPEN_DOOR - can open unstuck doors.
# BASH_DOOR - can bash doors which are stuck.
# PASS_DOOR - can pass through doors (and rubble).  Some creatures which are small enough to fit
#  under doors have this (like garter snakes, newts and small spiders).  Amorphis creatures (like
#  slimes and fog clouds) also have PASS_DOOR.
# PASS_WALL - can pass through walls.
# KILL_WALL - destroys walls, digging new tunnels.
# MOVE_BODY - can push past other monsters.
# KILL_BODY - tramples or eats other monsters.
# TAKE_ITEM - picks up items from the ground.
# KILL_ITEM - destroys items on the ground.
# RANGE - prefer shooting or casting spells from a distance to melee.
# S_EVIL1 / S_EVIL2 - sometimes, but not always, evil. 1-less often, 2-more often.
# ROAM1 / ROAM2 - monsters is more often awake before noticing the player.  2 more often than 1.
# DISGUISE - monster disguises as another monster (like a unique which at first appears to be a
#  normal monster of its race). - not used yet.
# ORC / TROLL / GIANT / DRAGON / DEMON / UNDEAD / ANIMAL - racial flags for slays and summons

# EVIL - monster is evil (for slay / detect / dispel evil)
# HELPER - monster helps the player instead of attacking (THEME_ONLY and extremely rare except when
#  summoned by a spell: call help for nature realm, summon demonic aid for necromancy realm).
#  The HELPER flag only changes monster behavior. The summoning by the spells is hard-coded by
#  monster index (so the call help nature spell never summons a HELPER demon or vice versa).
# NON_LIVING - monster is non-living (for golems, vortexes, and elementals). Drain life will not
#  work against non-living monsters or undead.
# HURT_LITE - monster is hurt by light.

#  extra damage from digging tools.

# RES_NETH / IM_WATER / RES_PLAS / RES_NEXUS / RES_DISE - monster resists nether/water/plasma/nexus/
#  disenchantment.  (mainly against the breath of other monsters).
# HURT_SILV - monster is hurt by silver (for SLAY_WERE and alchemist's silver bullet spell), not to
#  be confused with the SILVER monster flag.  SILVER is for grepse (see DJA110.txt), HURT_SILV is
#  for werebeasts, magic cats, vampires, and such.
# NO_FEAR / NO_STUN / NO_SLEEP / NO_CONF - monster is immune to fear/stunning/sleep/confusion.
#  NO_CONF does not protect light fairies from confusion by poison.
# BLOCK_LOS - monster blocks line of sight, used for tree monsters and wall monsters.
#  -should NOT be given to every huge monster which might realisticly block line of sight.

#  it may die from being out of the water. -gets a stealth bonus unless out of water.
# WATER_HIDE - monster likes the water, but isn't WATER_ONLY. -gets a stealth bonus when in water.
# HATE_WATER - usually will not enter water, if it does it takes damage.
