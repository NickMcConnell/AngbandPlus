D:The Big Boss himself. Before the universe the Serpent was. The Unicorn
D:of Order fought with Serpent and stole one of its eyes, known as the
D:Jewel of Judgement. With the Jewel, Dworkin drew the Pattern and thus
D:gave birth to the infinite worlds of shadow. Now the balance has been
D:disrupted, the Pattern damaged, and all the shadow is being absorbed by
D:the Serpent. Unless it is stopped, the world as we know it will come to
D:an end, all order reverting to Primal Chaos.
