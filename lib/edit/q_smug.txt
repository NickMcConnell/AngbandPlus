D:Illegal mushrooms are showing up on the streets and even in the school,
D:and more and more people are getting addicted. At first we thought the
D:new shroomery was to blame, but we raided the place and couldn't find
D:anything illegal. It appears the actual culprits are smugglers who get
D:the shrooms cheap from some old hobbit, sneak them into our town and sell
D:them here at a tidy profit. We know who they are and where they're
D:operating from, unfortunately a certain corn-loving hag won't give us a
D:search warrant, so legally there's absolutely nothing we can do.
D:We'd appreciate it if a private detective paid those sons of vampire bats
D:a quick visit and maybe killed them in self-defence. Their base is a small
D:house just north of here.

D:Thank you for your discreet help. You may keep any interesting mushrooms
D:you found; here's a legal extra one we booked as evidence earlier,
D:hopefully it will be of use to you. Er... you did kill the smugglers in
D:self-defence, right?

?:[AND [EQU $QUEST73 Failed] [EQU $WILDERNESS NORMAL] ]
D:Well, that's just fantabulous. Let's say you blundered in by accident and
D:happened to see a humongous pile of illegal mushrooms? Maybe we can use
D:that as evidence.

D:Illegal mushrooms are showing up on the streets, and I'm not behind it.
D:The actual culprits are smugglers who get the shrooms cheap from some old
D:hobbit, sneak them into the town and sell them at a tidy profit. I'd like
D:to expand a bit and take over their operation, or at least steal their
D:mushrooms; but it's very dangerous, they're a pretty tough group. I would
D:appreciate your help, their base is a small house south of the Arena.

D:Thank you for your help. I managed to steal this one mushroom earlier,
D:you can have it as a bonus.

?:[AND [EQU $QUEST73 Failed] [EQU $WILDERNESS NONE] ]
D:Too bad. Say, can you give me a blueprint of their place?
