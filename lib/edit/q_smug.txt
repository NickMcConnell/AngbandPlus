# Adapted from Frogspawn

?:[EQU $QUEST73 Taken InProgress]
D:Illegal mushrooms are showing up on the streets and even in the school,
D:and more and more people are getting addicted. At first we thought the
D:new shroomery was to blame, but we raided the place and couldn't find
D:anything illegal. It appears the actual culprits are smugglers who get
D:the shrooms cheap from some old hobbit, sneak them into our town and sell
D:them here at a tidy profit. We know who they are and where they're
D:operating from, unfortunately a certain corn-loving hag won't give us a
D:search warrant, so legally there's absolutely nothing we can do.
D:We'd appreciate it if a private detective paid those sons of vampire bats
D:a quick visit and maybe killed them in self-defence. Their base is a small
D:house just north of here.

?:[EQU $QUEST73 Completed]
D:Thank you for your discreet help. You may keep any interesting mushrooms
D:you found; here's a legal extra one we booked as evidence earlier,
D:hopefully it will be of use to you. Er... you did kill the smugglers in
D:self-defence, right?

?:[EQU $QUEST73 Failed]
D:Well, that's just fantabulous. Let's say you blundered in by accident and
D:happened to see a humongous pile of illegal mushrooms? Maybe we can use
D:that as evidence.
