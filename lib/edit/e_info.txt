# The ego-item indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed.

# Ego-items 1-63 are "armor", and 64-127 are "weapons"

# Note that every "ego-item" type has a different "index", and can only be

# one assumes that "ammo" belongs to an imaginary slot (23).
#
# Note that several "ego-item" types may share the same "textual name",
# such as with "Armor of Resistance" and "Shield of Resistance".

# Ego-items have descriptions that appear after that of the base object
