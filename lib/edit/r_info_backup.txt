#Belial in January
#Leviathan in February
#Satan in March
#SATAN: Satan is the Vice President of Hell, second only to the Devil himself and a significant player in the hierarchy of Hell.
#  His name means adversary in Hebrew, and he is the angel who occupies that role in the Old Testament. One of God's angels of destruction, 
#  it is Satan who rains misfortune on the head of poor Job. In the New Testament, Satan becomes synonymous with the Devil. 
#  It is Satan who tempts Eve through the serpent and plagues Jesus in the desert. Often confused with Lucifer, 
#  Satan also was a Seraphim angel bedecked with 12 wings, twice the amount customarily allotted to an angel of that rank. 
#  It may be that Satan really is the Evil One, the Prince of Hell, but enough writers and artists have depicted him as Lucifer's principal 
#  vassal that he merits a separate entry. Satan tempts humans to anger, in addition to every other sin imaginable. Satan was overthrown by the archangel Uriel.
#Belphegor in April
#  The patron devil of arrogance, lies, and deceit, Belial is one of the great fallen angels. A prince in the angelic Order of Virtues, 
#  he fell directly after Lucifer. A great orator, he may appear briefly as a gentleman, but his true nature always reveals itself because 
#  the image is hollow. Belial tempts men to disloyalty, gossip, and rebellion, and instigates women to dress in finery, gossip in church, 
#  and indulge their children. Belial's adversary in Heaven is Francis de Paul.
#Lucifer in May
#Berith in June
#  Hell's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chief Secretary, and Keeper of the Infernal Archives. He is often called upon to 
#  notarize pacts between humans and the Devil. A cantankerous spirit, he tempts men to be quarrelsome, contentious, and 
#  blasphemous. He also inspires them to commit murder. Baal-Berith is the patron devil of disobedience.
#Beelzebub in July
#  The Devil's Chief of Staff and second only to Lucifer in the organization of Hell. Known to many as the Prince of Death,
#  Beelzebub was Lucifer's closest companion and a fellow Seraphim angel in Heaven. Beelzebub manifests himself in the shape 
#  of a fly and presides over the Order of the Fly. He tempts men with the grandparents of all sin, envy and pride. He can send
#  plagues of flies. Heresy is attributed to Beelzebub, who blows his bellows into the ears of heretics.
#Astaroth in August
#Thammuz in September
#Baal in October
#  The Second Chief of Staff of the Abyss, Baal is the patron devil of idleness. He commands 60 or 70 legions of demons and resides in the 
#  eastern region of Hell. He shows himself as a pudgy creature with the arms of a spider and three heads: a toad, a cat, and a man.
#Asmodai in November
#Moloch in December
# A terrifying devil, Moloch serves as the Chief of the Army in Hell. He was once a Canaanite deity, worshipped by early Semites who 
# sacrificed their firstborn children in the fires of his temple located just outside Jerusalem. Moloch's face and hands are smeared
# with the blood of murdered children and the tears shed by their grieving mothers.
#ADRAMALECH: The King of Fire. Originally a Throne angel, Adramelech is now an archdemon and a great minister of Beelzebub's Order of the Fly. 
#  When called, he manifests himself in the form of a mule or a peacock. He was 
#  overthrown by the angels Uriel and Raphael during the War in Heaven. He is in charge of the Devil's attire and livery and is the patron of hypocrisy. 
#BEHEMOTH: The Devil's Cupbearer, Behemoth is the patron devil of despair and gluttony. He appears in the shape of a monstrous elephant with two bear's feet.
#  He will also take the form of a crocodile, whale, or hippopotamus and is related to fellow demon, Leviathan. Behemoth presides over the feasts in Hell and
#   is responsible for dishing up food and wine for the Devil. He entertains Hell's motley crew with song and plays the role of night watchman, as he is often
#  awake all night. Unsurprisingly, he creates chaos and havoc in the lives of men.
#CARNIVEAN: The patron devil of lewd and obscene behavior, he tempts people to act shamelessly. He is often invoked by witches during a Sabbat. His adversary in Heaven is John the Evangelist.
#CARREAU: Once a prince of the angelic Order of Powers, Carreau makes people harden their hearts. His adversary in Heaven is Vincent and Vincent Ferrer.
#DAGON: Dagon was the national god of the Philistines (i.e. Goliath), appearing in the form of a kind of merman with the torso of a man and the body of a fish. He serves as the pantry chef in Hell's kitchen.
#FORCAS: A senator in Hell, Forcas spends his infernal days teaching rhetoric, logic, and mathematics. 
#He is the master of the Devil's stables and can render objects invisible at will. When invoked, he can help find lost objects. (Pardon me, but I can't find one bad thing about this guy)
#FURCALOR: A murderous fallen angel and a former member of the angelic Order of Thrones, Furcalor enjoys sinking warships. He appears as a human with the wings of a griffin.
#GRESSIL: Once a prince in the angelic Order of Thrones, the lecherous Gressil now tempts men with impurity and slothfulness. His adversary in Heaven is Saint Bernard (not the dog, mind you).
#HAURUS: One of the 72 devils King Solomon shut up in a brass vessel and threw into a lake, Haurus is a leader in Hell and is able to divine the truth about events occurring in the past or future.
#   He may take the form of a leopard, a human, or some combination of both.
#HORNBLAS: A patron devil of musical discord, he blows the trumpet to gather the ministry of Hell together.
#IMAMAIH: Imamaih oversees voyages and can be invoked to destroy and humiliate enemies.
#MISROCH: Misroch is the Devil's cook and inspires hatred between men. He was originally an angel of the Order of Principalities and worshipped by the Assyrians.
#  Misroch has the head of an eagle and was at one time the guardian of the famed Tree of Immortality, the fruit of which he uses in his recipes.
# RIMMON: Rimmon is the only doctor in Hell. In Babylonian times, he was believed to be the conjurer of thunder and storms. His symbol is the pomegranate.
#SAMMAEL: His name is a combination of the Hebrew sam, meaning poison, and el, or angel. He is the devil of death and prince among demons and magicians.
#  In some traditions, it is he who slithers into the Garden of Eden and seduces Eve, thereby impregnating her with Cain. Sammael is reportedly a handsome,
#  redheaded young man and is quite difficult for females to resist. He is said to have a great appreciation for human art and considered to be the first art critic.
#SUCCOR-BELOTH: Another indignant devil who tempts men to lechery. Succor-Beloth presides over the Devil's harem. (Woo!! What a job!  )
#VERRIER: Verrier tempts men to disobey by making their necks too stiff to bow to the yoke of obedience. 
#  In other words, he encourages revolution. His adversary in Heaven is Saint Bernard (same saint, not the same dog).
#XAPHAN: A rabble-rouser of the worst sort, Xaphan suggested the rebel angels set fire to Heaven during the War of the Angels. 
#  His idea met with a warm reception, but before a spark could fly, the lot of them were cast into the Abyss. Xaphan fell hard thanks in part to his fiendish inventiveness. 
#  Now he fans the Flames of Damnation. A set of bellows is his symbol.
# Alal, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alal , demons calling men into sin.
# Apollyon , leading the locust-like swarm of demons that will be released in the End Times:

#This dandified devil, the patron evil spirit behind passion, lechery, pleasure, luxury, and sensuality, runs the casinos and gambling houses in Hell.
#Able to appear as the most beautiful, well-dressed young man (or woman), he tempts his victims by encouraging them to buy fancy clothes and follow 
#meaningless fads. He is the prince of profligates and loves to lure happily married couples into adulterous affairs, sometimes with himself. This 
#hapless devil prides himself on arranging ridiculously inappropriate marriages and leads humans into squandering their assets. He wreaks havoc in 
#convents and monasteries by seducing their inhabitants. His mother may have been human (or, according to some, she could have been Lilith), but his
#father was an angel. When Asmodeus visits some poor human in his real form, he actually has three heads symbolic of lechery, those of a bull, 
#a ram, and a man. He also sports the feet of a rooster. He cavorts around on the back of a dragon wielding a spear. He is credited with having 
#invented carousels, music, dancing, drama, and, one may assume, recreational drug use. Asmodeus' adversary in Heaven is John the Baptist.
