# File: r_info.txt
# With new monsters for Zangband 2.2 (or 2.3)

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Zangband notes:

# Currently, "unique" monsters are just "special" monster races, with
# the requirement that only one monster of that race can exist at a time,
# and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters acquire their attr from the item/floor below them,
# and use "white" for the recall window. See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters have a "flickering" attr, and use "violet" for the
# recall window. See "cave.c" for info.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters use special symbols (.) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window. In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# floors, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# CHAR_MULTI monsters use special symbols (!, ?, =) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window. In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# objects, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# Note that there are (a few) normal monsters who are "violet" but not
# ATTR_MULTI, and a lot of monsters which are "white" but not ATTR_CLEAR.

# Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see.

# The "0" and "9" symbols are reserved for internal debugging use.

# The "&" symbol is reserved for future use as a special "terrain feature".

# The "`" symbol is reserved as an "alternate" open door picture, since
# the "'" symbol looks like the "," symbol in some fonts (esp. IBM).

# The "x" symbol is free for use as an "attr/char mapping" for annoying
# monsters, such as magic mushrooms, drolems, etc.

# Certain symbols ("X", "Y", "B", "l", "I", etc) are used by
# very few monsters, and could be reorganized somewhat.

# There are still too many "p" monsters, perhaps they should be broken up.

# As always, you can enforce any "visual picture" you want with a "pref file".

# Note that monster zero is used for the "player" picture.

# === Understanding r_info.txt ===

# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness : weight (lbs)
# W: depth : rarity : max_depth : exp : next_exp : next_mon
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: Description

# Possessor Extra Information (Optional)
#  The token after P: is a literal an must match case
#  The Copy option, if used, should be specified first.
#   Subsequent options increment this 'baseline', except for Life
#   which is applied multiplicatively.
#  As always, case matters for string lookups (RaceName, ClassName, BodyName).
#  Body types are defined in b_info.txt. If you don't specify one, you get the
#   standard humanoid body type as a default.

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 32 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Black       w - White        s - Gray        o - Orange
# r - Red         g - Green        b - Blue        u - Brown
# d - Dark Gray   W - Light Gray   v - Violet      y - Yellow
# R - Light Red   G - Light Green  B - Light Blue  U - Light Brown
# L - Int. Green  P - Pink         I - Int. Blue   C - Purple
# t - Teal        S - Sky-Blue     m - Mud         M - Dark Yellow
# T - Turquoise   O - Light Orange V - Lilac       c - Dark Purple
# n - Dark Sky    K - Pale Blue    p - Dark Pink   h - Chestnut

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
# armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
# from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
# intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, and experience for
# killing. The third slot is unused.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
# from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
# damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
# number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
# one of its spells. X must not be zero.
# Alt: Use S:FREQ_NN to specify the spell frequency directly.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
# ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.

# 'P' is for posessor information. Generally this should lead with a
# "copy directive" as in P:Copy:Human:Warrior to establish a baseline
# for stats and skills. This also determines the spell stat, if any.

D:and her hair was green, though streaked with silver, and her eyes
D:were round of moons of jade and her brows rose like the wings of
D:olive gulls. Her mouth was small, her chin was small; her cheeks
D:were high and wide and rounded. A circlet of white gold crossed
D:her brow and there was a crystal necklace about her neck. At its
D:tip there flashed a sapphire between her sweet bare breasts, whose
D:nipples were also bare green. She wore scaled trunks of blue and
D:a silver belt, and she held a scepter of pink coral in her hand
D:and had a ring upon every finger, and each ring had a stone of
D:a different blue within it. She did not smile..."
