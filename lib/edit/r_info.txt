# File: r_info.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "monster race" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file.

# Currently, "unique" monsters are just "special" monster races, with
# the requirement that only one monster of that race can exist at a time,
# and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters acquire their attr from the item/floor below them,
# and use "white" for the recall window.  See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters have a "flickering" attr, and use "violet" for the
# recall window.  See "cave.c" for info.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters use special symbols (.) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window.  In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# floors, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# CHAR_MULTI monsters use special symbols (!, ?, =) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window.  In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# objects, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# Note that there are (a few) normal monsters who are "violet" but not
# ATTR_MULTI, and a lot of monsters which are "white" but not ATTR_CLEAR.

# Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see.

# Note that the monster list underwent several changes for Angband 2.7.9,
# including some monster name changes, some symbol redistributions, and
# some color changes.

# The Umber Hulk joined the Xorn/Xaren (X).  The ticks (t) joined the
# spiders (S).  The townspeople (t) left the people (p).  The major demons 
# (&) became (U) and the minor demons (I) became (u).  Multiplying insects 
# (fleas, fruit flies, hummerhorns) became (I), visually "matching" the 
# multiplying lice (l). The "ant lions" (a) became "ants" (a).  The mummified 
# monsters (M) joined the zombified monsters (z).  The multi-headed hydras 
# (M) left the reptiles (R).  The snakes (J) left the reptiles (R).

#   The "dragons", "hounds" and "vortex" monsters underwent a "color 
# scheme regularization": 'w' = White/Cold, 's' = Black/Acid, 'o' = Lite, 
# 'r' = Red/Fire, 'g' = Green/Poison, 'b' = Blue/Elec, 'u' = Brown/Earth/Force, 
# 'D' = Dark/etc, 'W' = Stone/Inertia/Gravity/etc, ATTR_MULTI = Multi-hued,
# Chaos or Disenchantment/etc, 'y' = Gold/Sound, 'v' = Nexus (hounds and 
# vortices) or Balance (dragons), 'G' = Nether, 'B' = Time (hounds, vortices) 
# or Law (dragons, breathe sound/shards), 'U' = Bronze/Confusion, 'R' = Plasma.

#   In several situations, two or more monsters with identical symbols and
# colors were changed so that maximal information is conveyed by the symbol
# and color.

#   "v"iolet is often used by the biggest, toughest unique (or sometimes non-
# unique) monster in a race. Mughash, Azog, The Mouth of Sauron, Gothmog and 
# many others are treated like this. Monsters where a specific other color is 
# implied are exempt from this - e.g. Ancalagon the Black, Morgoth Lord of
# Darkness, the fact that the Ringwraiths were alternatively called the "Black 
# Riders", Gabriel being an angel of light, The Phoenix being such a fiery 
# creature that it has to be red, Fundin Bluecloak being blue, etc.

# The "people" (p), with more than 50 entries, got a new "color scheme"
# ('w' = Paladin, 's' = Knight, 'o' = Mystic, 'r' = Mage, 'g' = Priest, 
# 'b' = Thief, 'u' = Warrior, 'D' = Death knight, 'W' = Ranger, 'v' = Big Bad 
# Unique (this also applies to most monster races now), 'R' = Unique Mage, 
# 'G' = Unique Priest, 'B' = Unique Thief, 'U' = Unique Warrior).  Note that 
# most non-unique "people" already had these colors, or colors close to these 
# colors.  A similar color scheme was enforced for the "humanoid" (h) monsters 
# as well, more or less. However, if a color is implied directly by a monster's 
# name, then that takes precedence over the color scheme: as in the case of 
# "Fundin Bluecloak" or "Ancalagon the Black".

# Many of the "unique" monsters were changed to "match" the "base" monster
# from which they were derived. 

# Mushrooms look just like food (and use the "," symbol for both the recall
# window and for normal display), Creeping coins look just like coins (and
# use the "$" symbol for both the recall window and for normal display), and
# Trappers/Lurkers can never be seen (and use the "." symbol for the recall
# window).  There are also mimics of scrolls, potions, chests and rings, each
# of which uses the appropriate symbol for the recall window and for normal 
# display. All other monsters use "alphabetic" symbols, and "alphabetic"
# symbols are used only for monsters.

# The "0" and "9" symbols are reserved for internal debugging use.

# The "&" symbol is reserved for future use as a special "terrain feature".

# The "`" symbol is reserved as an "alternate" open door picture, since
# the "'" symbol looks like the "," symbol in some fonts (esp. IBM).

# The "x" symbol is free for use as an "attr/char mapping" for annoying
# monsters, such as magic mushrooms, drolems, etc.

# Certain symbols ("X", "Y", "B", "l", "I", etc) are used by
# very few monsters, and could be reorganized somewhat.

# There are still too many "p" monsters, perhaps they should be broken up.

# As always, you can enforce any "visual picture" you want with a "pref file".

# Note that monster zero contains the "player" picture.

# A lot of new monsters have been added in this patch - 46, to be exact,
# while 5 old ones have gone missing. The S_HI_DEMON spell is actually
# going to be scary now, as opposed to wimpy... there are also new
# "B"irds, "q"uadrupeds, some dragon gaps are now filled, the
# "character-class-type" "p"eople have been filled out so  that all
# classes have their "novice", "experienced" and "expert" levels. Some old
# friends have come back from Moria, two titanic Giant uniques have joined
# the fun, and there are various others, some Tolkienish, some less so.

### Gone AWOL (5)

# - Cerberus (duplication of role with Carcharoth - Hound Guarding Hell, 
# Personal Servant Of The Master Of The Underworld)
# - Tiamat (duplication of role with Ancalagon - Biggest Baddest Dragon Of 
# All)
# - Archpriest (duplication of role with Patriarch - two "expert" priests, too 
# close to each other in level)
# - Novice Archer (duplication of role with Novice Ranger - two "novice" 
# archer-types.)
# - Emperor Quylthulg (near-duplication of Qlzqqlzzuup, who now has this 
# title.)

#   Giants are much tougher (and deeper.) Two uniques have been added to the 
# race (see above).

#   Dracolisks, -liches and titans are placed deeper, on the grounds that they 
# are tougher than uniques at their original level and for some levels deeper 
# even than that... compare the Balrog of Moria, or Smaug, for instance.

# Big rationalisation of the Dragons: now there is a "baby", "young",
# "mature", "ancient" and "wyrm" form for all of red, white, blue, green,
# black, gold, bronze and multi-hued. Other dragons come usually in two
# types - the "drake" and a  greater form, sometimes called a "dragon" (as
# in Ethereal Dragon - the former Death Drake and Great Crystal Drake are
# now Shadow and Crystal Dragons), or a Great Wyrm (as in drakes and
# great wyrms of Law, Chaos and Balance.)

# Changes to monster depths in the late stages: to make sure that at least 
# *one* new monster has a native depth at every depth from 2500' to 4000', 
# and no more than one unique per level. No new non-uniques appear after 
# 4000'. 

# I understand that dracolisks used to breathe nexus, not nether, and that
# this  was changed, possibly to constant confusion with dracoliches. I
# prefer the  original version, and have changed them back. (They still
# breathe fire for a  big amount of damage, and who is going to bother
# resisting nexus at this level?  At which point, you suddenly find
# yourself sinking through the floor of that  level with the Greater Vault
# on it...) It makes sense: they're not undead, and only hounds and
# vortices among non-undead things ought to breathe nether in my 
# opinion... and that thanks to the fact that they enjoy a more
# "elemental" kind of  existence, being as they are beings of pure
# substance and no true "life" or  "soul", not even the perverted and
# twisted unlife of the undead.

# Take a look at the description of the "Angel" and "paladin" monsters.
# You might  realise why you're fighting "good" creatures... by the way, I
# changed the names of the monsters to "angel", "archangel", "cherub",
# "seraph" and "archon", on the  grounds that it's far cooler than
# "monadic deva" and "planetar" and suchlike.

# Smeagol is far harder to nail down. But he may - just *might* - drop 
# something nice. Or rob you blind when you can't see him.

# A lot of inconsistencies have been cleared up, e.g. cave ogres being
# worth  fewer xp than black ogres, or acidic cytoplasms compared to
# gelatinous cubes.  And there are no "left-handed" dragons or hounds with
# one claw attack bigger than the other, nor do such monsters have one or
# three claw attacks, but two. All Qs are non-evil (with no intelligence,
# how can they be evil?) and natural, and have no  minds - not even the
# unique. Pazuzu, described as a demon, actually is one rather  than a
# "B"ird. Some non-uniques have escorts - mostly "captain" or "chieftain" 
# monsters, of which there are now several - for orcs, trolls, ogres and
# yeeks (the ogre chieftain was the Ogre Shaman, the troll chieftain was
# the "Eldrak" formerly). Monster depths have been reworked so that the
# last unique in a race appears *after*  the last non-unique. Two monsters
# (formerly known as Muar and Murazor) have lost  their names, being
# simply the Balrog of Moria and the Witch-King of Angmar.

# Exactly five more monsters have DROP_GREAT - all of them deep except for Mim. 
# (The others are Saruman, Vecna, the Witch-King and Glaurung.)

# Dragons kick ass in melee combat.

# Trolls regenerate, as in AD&D.

# The Jabberwock is back, in place of the Chaos Beetle (which was simply a 
# renamed Jabberwock.) He is a multi-hued H on the grounds that I couldn't find
# any other category worth sticking him in - H will do for odds and ends.

# For historical reasons, the Killer Iridescent Beetle is back as well - I 
# never liked his renaming to the killer Blue beetle.

# Description and spelling of "Chimaera" corrected to proper Greek myth
# specs, and its three attacks are correct for the creatures: the goat-head 
# butts, the lion bites, the dragon burns. Also is significantly tougher - 
# far too wimpy as they stand. The original was supposed to be terrifying.

# Gorgimaera (corrected spelling) also changed in similar fashion - the 
# goat butts, the dragon burns, the gorgon gazes to paralyze.

# "Hippogriff" hybrid is purely eagle and horse, no lion. This was a simple
# error on the part of someone who doesn't know their myths well enough.


# === Understanding r_info.txt ===

# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
# W: depth : rarity : unused (always 0) : experience for kill
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 15 colors, as
# follows:

# D: "Black"	s: Grey		W: Light Grey 	w: White
# r: Red	R: Light Red	b: Blue		B: Light Blue
# g: Green	G: Light Green	u: Brown	U: Light Brown
# y: Yellow	o: Orange	v: Violet

# Note that "D", meaning "black", is in fact a very dark grey rather than 
# a genuine black: this is, of course, because the background is black, and the
# monsters should be visible against the background. The color "d" may be used 
# for monsters which are not meant to be visible against the background, and 
# are thus a truly and totally black color: however, there are none such in the 
# standard version of Angband.

# Note also that "multi-hued" is not a "color" (to be shown in the "G:" line)
# but a "flag", to be shown in the "F:" lines later: one line should read 
# "F:ATTR_MULTI" to make a multi-hued monster. It does not then matter what
# the color is as defined in the "G:" line, except for the purposes of how it 
# appears in the monster memory: all current "multi-hued" monsters default to 
# "v"iolet at the moment, and will appear as such in the monster memory.

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
# armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
# from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
# intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, and experience for
# killing. The third slot is unused, and always 0.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
# from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
# damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X, meaning that 
# the monster has a 1 in X chance of casting a spell instead of moving 
# this turn, if the player is in its line of sight. Note, firstly, 
# (a) that X cannot be 0 as the result would involve division by zero, 
# and (b) if X=1, then this means a 1 in 1 chance, i.e. a certainty of
# casting a spell - if the player is in sight, the monster will not 
# move. This, particularly, makes physical attacks redundant on such 
# a monster, and so if you wish the monster to attack or move towards
# the player, X must be no less than 2, with the 1-in-1 chance reserved 
# for monsters which never attack in melee - for instance, druj and the 
# greater Quylthulgs.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
# ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.

D:creatures with his evil powers.  Orcs, Dragons, and Trolls are his most 
D:foul corruptions, causing much pain and suffering in the world to please 
D:him.  His disgusting visage, twisted with evil, is crowned with iron, the
