# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "monster race" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file.
# Also, modify misc.txt when adding new creatures.

# PernAngband notes:

# Currently, "unique" monsters are just "special" monster races, with
# the requirement that only one monster of that race can exist at a time,
# and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters acquire their attr from the item/floor below them,
# and use "white" for the recall window. See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters have a "flickering" attr, and use "violet" for the
# recall window. See "cave.c" for info.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters use special symbols (.) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window. In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# floors, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# CHAR_MULTI monsters use special symbols (!, ?, =) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window. In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# objects, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# Note that there are (a few) normal monsters who are "violet" but not
# ATTR_MULTI, and a lot of monsters which are "white" but not ATTR_CLEAR.

# Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see.

# Note that the monster list underwent several changes for Angband 2.7.9,
# including some monster name changes, some symbol redistributions, and
# some color changes.

# The Umber Hulk joined the Xorn/Xaren (X). The ticks (t) joined the
# spiders (S). The townspeople (t) left the people (p). The "Jabberwock"
# became the "Chaos beetle" (K). The major demons (&) became (U) and the
# minor demons (I) became (u). Multiplying insects (fleas, fruit flies,
# hummerhorns) became (I), visually "matching" the multiplying lice (l).
# The "ant lions" (a) became "ants" (a). The mummified monsters (M)
# joined the zombified monsters (z). The multi-headed hydras (M) left
# the reptiles (R). The snakes (J) left the reptiles (R).

# Some of the old "red" or "brown" monsters became "pink" if they lower
# strength, while some of the old "fire" monsters became simply "red"
# monsters. The "dragons" and "hounds" and related monsters underwent
# a "color scheme regularization" ('w' = White/Cold, 's' = Black/Acid,
# 'o' = Lite/Dark, 'r' = Red/Fire, 'g' = Green/Poison, 'b' = Blue/Elec,
# 'u' = Brown/Earth/Force, 'D' = Dark/etc, 'W' = Stone/Inertia/Gravity/etc,
# 'v' = Multihued/Chaos/Disenchantment/etc, 'y' = Gold/Sound, 'R' = Nexus,
# 'G' = Nether, 'B' = Left-overs, and 'U' = Bronze/Confusion).

# In several situations, two or more monsters with identical symbols and
# colors were changed so that maximal information is conveyed by the symbol
# and color.

# The "people" (p), with more than 50 entries, got a new "color scheme"
# ('w' = Paladin, 's' = Knight, 'o' = Mystic, 'r' = Mage, 'g' = High Priest,
# 'b' = Thief, 'u' = Warrior, 'D' = Death knight, 'W' = Ranger/Archer,
# 'v' = Sorcerer, 'y' = Ninja, 'R' = High Mage, 'G' = Priest, 'B' = High
# Thief, 'U' = High Warrior). Note that most non-unique "people" already
# had these colors, or colors close to these colors. A similar color scheme
# was enforced for the "humanoid" (h) monsters as well, more or less.

# TY: This is no longer entirely accurate. The monster coloring has been
# changed 'back' to pre-2.7.* coloring in several cases. For example, I
# prefer "black" thief characters. Also color can be (and should) be used to
# convey information, but more importantly it is a visual presentation
# of the creature and should be what the creature "looks" like.

# Many of the "unique" monsters were changed to "match" the "base" monster
# from which they were derived. Angband 2.8.0 may require every "unique"
# monster to be based on a "normal" monster, and may enforce color matching.
# This may result in the addition of some new monsters, to serve as "base"
# monsters, possibly including Ogre captains, Greater Balrogs, Black Trolls,
# Vampire Queens, Giant Werewolves, and others. This may be accompanied by
# a separation of the monster list into a "normal" monster list (r_info)
# with 512 entries, and a "unique" monster list (u_info) with 128 entries,
# which will require reorganization of the list. Some new "player ghost"
# unique monsters will probably be added at the same time.

# Mushrooms look just like food (and use the "," symbol for both the recall
# window and for normal display), Creeping coins look just like coins (and
# use the "$" symbol for both the recall window and for normal display), and
# Trappers/Lurkers can never be seen (and use the "." symbol for the recall
# window). All other monsters use "alphabetic" symbols, and "alphabetic"
# symbols are used only for monsters.

# The "0" and "9" symbols are reserved for internal debugging use.

# The "&" symbol is reserved for future use as a special "terrain feature".

# The "`" symbol is reserved as an "alternate" open door picture, since
# the "'" symbol looks like the "," symbol in some fonts (esp. IBM).

# The "x" symbol is free for use as an "attr/char mapping" for annoying
# monsters, such as magic mushrooms, drolems, etc.

# Certain symbols ("X", "Y", "B", "l", "I", etc) are used by
# very few monsters, and could be reorganized somewhat.

# There are still too many "p" monsters, perhaps they should be broken up.

# As always, you can enforce any "visual picture" you want with a "pref file".


###### Understanding the entries ######

# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
# W: depth : rarity : corpse weight : experience for kill
# E: weapons : torso : arms : finger : head : leg
# O: treasure : combat : magic : tool
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# F: flag | flag | etc
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Black        W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
#     armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
#     from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
#     intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, corpse weight (expressed
#     in deci-pounds) [19 deci-pounds seem to get added to these number
#     in practice], and experience for killing.

# 'E' is for equipment slots - weapon slots, torso slots (the "on body"
#     and "about body" equipment slots), arm slots (expressed in number
#     of pairs), finger slots, head slots, and leg slots (expressed
#     in number of pairs).

# 'O' is for object drop chances - % chance to drop treasure, % chance
#     to drop combat items, % chance to drop magic type items (not 
#     items of good blessing), and % chance to drop tools.  The four 
#     percents added together must be equal to or less than 100.  If
#     the percent is less than 100, that is the chance for the monster
#     to drop junk.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
#     from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
#     damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
#     number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
#     one of its spells. X must not be zero.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
#     lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
#     are separated by the '|' symbol. The '|' symbol must also be used
#     to end all but the last line.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
#     to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
#     ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.


# Note that monster zero is used for the "player" picture.

D:mountain crowned with Lightning. He rages with everlasting anger, his 
D:body scarred by Fingolfin's eight mighty wounds. He can never rest from 
D:his pain, but seeks forever to dominate all that is light and good in the 
D:world. He is the origin of man's fear of darkness and created many foul 
D:creatures with his evil powers. Orcs, Dragons, and Trolls are his most 
D:foul corruptions, causing much pain and suffering in the world to please 
D:him. His disgusting visage, twisted with evil, is crowned with iron, the 
D:two remaining Silmarils forever burning him. Grond, the mighty Hammer of 
D:the Underworld, cries defiance as he strides towards you to crush you to a 
D:pulp!

D: Using the fossils of Archaeopteryx and Compsognathus, a bird-sized
D: and bird-like dinosaur, Huxley argued that birds and reptiles were
D: descended from common ancestors. Archaeopteryx
D: (meaning "ancient wing") is a very early prehistoric bird,
D: dating from about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic
D: period, when many dinosaurs lived. It is one of the oldest-known birds.

D:(pronounced HAD-roh-SAWR-us) Hadrosaurus (meaning "bulky
D: lizard" ) was a duck-billed dinosaur, a 23 to 32 feet (7 to
D: 10 m) long ornithischian from the late Cretaceous period.
D: Hadrosaurus was discovered by W. P. Foulke and excavated and
D: named by anatomist J. Leidy in 1858 from a skull-less skeleton
D: and hundreds of teeth found in New Jersey. It was the first
D: American dinosaur to be described and the first nearly-complete
D: dinosaur skeleton. Although the Hadrosaurids are named for this
D: genus, Hadrosaurus is a doubtful genus because there is so little
D: fossil information about it (including no skull). The type species
D: is H. foulkii; it was named by paleontologist J. Leidy in 1858.

D:He appears to be at least a century old, and possibly immortal,
D: He is a self-appointed exile, an isolationist and visionary with a
D: distaste for materialist bourgeois life as well as for the German government
D: (but not the German people). He looks "suave, athletic and rippling,"
D: and appears to be an expert swordsman. He is taught in the occult ways by the
D: mysterious Master Janus, who may or may not be engineering Axel's death.
D: He is the creation of Comte Philippe Auguste Matthias de Villiers de
D: l'Isle Adam (1838-1889), who wrote about him in the play Axel.

D:"A man stood awaiting us at the water's edge. I fancied
D: while we were still far off that I saw some other and
D: very grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into the bushes
D: upon the slope; but I saw nothing of these as we drew nearer.
D: This man was of a moderate size, and with a black negroid face.
D: He had a large, almost lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms,
D: long thin feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face thrust
D: forward staring at us. He was dressed like Montgomery and his
D: white-haired companion, in jacket and trousers of blue serge.

D:"A face was gazing into mine--at the distance of only a foot or
D: two.... It was a human face--or at least it was far more human than
D: any monkey's that I have ever seen. It was long, whitish, and
D: blotched with pimples, the nose flattened, and the lower jaw
D: projecting, with a bristle of coarse whiskers round the chin. The
D: eyes, which were under thick and heavy brows, were bestial and
D: ferocious, and as it opened its mouth to snarl what sounded like
D: a curse at me I observed that it had curved, sharp canine teeth.
D: For an instant I read hatred and menace in the evil eyes. Then, as
D: quick as a flash, came an expression of overpowering fear. There
D: was a crash of broken boughs as it dived wildly down into the tangle
D: of green. I caught a glimpse of a hairy body like that of a reddish

D: it is unusually small and pointing downward, and the mask is

D: thins out to a mere membrane, through which the pulsating

D: Great Bandit (1794). His real name is Neapolitan Count Rosalvo,
D: who desires to rid Venice of all assassins, thugs, and conspirators.
D: He takes two different identies to accomplish this task. Flodoardo
D: virtuous and handsome -- and Aballino, a gigantic terrifying outlaw
D: with a horrifying visage. Aballino is told to kill Rosabella,
D: his love, the niece of the Doge, to prove his worth to a
D: underworld gang of thugs. Instead of killing her he kisses her.
D: The Doge then hires Flodardo with the promise that he can have
D: Rosabella's hand in marriage if he captures Aballino.
D: The Count does so. He calls all the outlaws together, and allows
D: himself to be captured along with all of them -- only to reveal himself
D: as Flodardo.

D:Mary Shelley wrote about Victor and his monster (1818). "His limbs were
D: in proportion and I had selected his features as beautiful.
D: Beautiful!--Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work
D: of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black,
D: and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances
D: only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed
D: almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were
D: set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips." Eloquent, and
D: well educated, the monster demands that Victor make him a bride to give
D: him a place in the world, or he will kill everyone that Victor
D: knows. Victor returns and attempts this, but is overcome with
D: guilt with evil that he has already committed and cannot finish.
D: He destroys this new monstrosity and flees to meet his fiancee.
D: On his way he hears her dying scream as the monster kills her.

D: "I do not like to mention the Agwas, but they are a part of this
D: history, and can not be ignored.  They were neither mortals nor
D: immortals, but stood midway between these classes of beings.  The
D: Agwas were invisible to ordinary people, but not to immortals.  They
D: could pass swiftly through the air from one part of the world to
D: another, and had the power of influencing the minds of human beings
D: to do their wicked will. " - L Frank Baum, The Life and Adventures of

D:"When Lucy, I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore
D: her shape, saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat
D: gives when taken unawares, then her eyes ranged over us.  Lucy's eyes

D: instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew.  At that moment the remnant
D: of my love passed into hate and loathing. . . As she looked, her eyes
D: blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a
D: voluptuous smile.  Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it!" -

D: revolutionary war; and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk
D: hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind.
D: His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to
D: the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at
D: no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians
D: of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating
D: the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege that the body
D: of the trooper, having been buried in the church-yard, the ghost
D: rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head;
D: and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along
D: the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated,
D: and in a hurry to get back to the church-yard before daybreak."

D:"'The Moreau Horrors!' The phrase drifted loose in my
D: mind for a moment, and then I saw it in red lettering on
D: a little buff-coloured pamphlet, to read which made one
D: shiver and creep. . . .
D:   Was this the same Moreau? He had published some very astonishing
D: facts in connection with the transfusion of blood, and in addition
D: was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly
D: his career was closed. A journalist obtained
D: access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with
D: the deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help
D: of a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became
D: notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and otherwise
D: mutilated, escaped from Moreau's house. . . It was not the first time that
D: conscience has turned against the methods of research. The doctor was
D: simply howled out of the country. . . .
D: Yet some of his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly
D: cruel. He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his
D: investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men would
D: who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research. He was
D: unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider."
