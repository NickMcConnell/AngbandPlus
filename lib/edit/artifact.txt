#
## 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
## increase for each new item.
#
## 'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the
## sval identifies the subtype.
#
## 'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is
## normally found at, rarity determines how common the object is,
## weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the item's value. base chance
## is divided by the artifacts rarity - a rarity of 1 leaves base chance 
## as is, a rarity of 2 cuts it in half, a rarity of 3 cuts it in a third.
## base chance is 10000 / 2*(# of levels OOD). So, on the level that the 
## artifact should be found on it has a base chance of 10000 if the artifact
## rarity is 1. Note that this base chance value is fairly likely to be 
## generated. 
#
## 'P' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base
## damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam and to-ac and force value. Currently 
## the artifacts force value is not used, only the base objects force 
## value. This should be changed at some point - artifact force should 
## either be additive, or replace base force value.
#
# 'O' is for item percentile resistances. This resistance is additative
# with ego and artifact resistances.
# O:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
#
## 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
## lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
## are separated by the '|' symbol.
#
## 'A' is for activation.  Activation is the effect the artifact
## activates for. The recharge time calculates from the recharge time
## plus a random value between 1 and the recharge time dice (if not 0).
## The recharge time _must_ be a higher value than the base time, or strangeness
## may occur. For that matter, strangeness may occur anyway.
## If an activation is given then the artifact must also have the
## ACTIVATE flag. The activation is based off the specific artifact, and 
## is refrenced by name.

#
# Note that changing or adding artifacts will have influence on the
# random artifacts and will break savefile compatibility!
