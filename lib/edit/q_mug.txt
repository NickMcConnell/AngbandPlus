# New quest for FrogComposband 7.1.chocolate

?:[EQU $QUEST24 Taken InProgress]
D:There's a warehouse at the northern edge of the city that Vanerion, the
D:librarian, has used for storing rare books. About half a year ago, people
D:started reporting a malevolent presence there, as if they were being spied
D:on by someone unseen. Last week Vanerion went there for a book, and when
D:he opened the door he barely recognized the place. A gang of thieves seems
D:to have set up shop there; but more worryingly, the books themselves were
D:coming to life. The malevolent presence was everywhere, and demonic signs
D:appeared on the floor. Please locate and destroy the source of this evil,
D:reports indicate the ability to kill from range could be of paramount
D:importance.
