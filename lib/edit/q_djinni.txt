# New quest for FrogComposband 7.0.strawberry

?:[EQU $QUEST70 Taken InProgress]
D:We've had a few problems lately with the rogue djinni who lives in a
D:cavern to the northeast of the city. It was previously quite tame and
D:did the bidding of a local sorcerer, but the man vanished some time ago
D:and the djinni has been out of control since then. Please visit its cave
D:and eliminate it and any lesser spirits that may attend to it. (I've
D:heard rumours that the djinni might become friendly again if offered
D:peppermint leaves; so if you have any, that could be an alternative way
D:to deal with it.)

?:[EQU $QUEST70 Completed]
D:My men found this valuable lamp in the djinni's secret treasure trove,
D:I hope you find it an acceptable token of our gratitude.
