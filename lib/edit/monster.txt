# File: monster.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/monster.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "monster race" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/monster.raw" file.

# Currently, "unique" monsters are just "special" monster races, with
# the requirement that only one monster of that race can exist at a time,
# and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters acquire their attr from the item/floor below them,
# and use "white" for the recall window.  See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters have a "flickering" attr, and use "violet" for the
# recall window.  See "cave.c" for info.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters use special symbols (.) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window.  In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# floors, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# CHAR_MULTI monsters use special symbols (!, ?, =) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window.  In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# objects, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# Note that there are (a few) normal monsters who are "violet" but not
# ATTR_MULTI, and a lot of monsters which are "white" but not ATTR_CLEAR.

# Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see.

# Note that the monster list underwent several changes for Angband 2.7.9,
# including some monster name changes, some symbol redistributions, and
# some color changes.

# The Umber Hulk joined the Xorn/Xaren (X).  The ticks (t) joined the
# spiders (S).  The townspeople (t) left the people (p).  The "Jabberwock"
# became the "Chaos beetle" (K).  The major demons (&) became (U) and the
# minor demons (I) became (u).  Multiplying insects (fleas, fruit flies,
# hummerhorns) became (I), visually "matching" the multiplying lice (l).
# The "ant lions" (a) became "ants" (a).  The mummified monsters (M)
# joined the zombified monsters (z).  The multi-headed hydras (M) left
# the reptiles (R).  The snakes (J) left the reptiles (R).

# Some of the old "red" or "brown" monsters became "pink" if they lower
# strength, while some of the old "fire" monsters became simply "red"
# monsters.  The "dragons" and "hounds" and related monsters underwent
# a "color scheme regularization" ('w' = White/Cold, 's' = Black/Acid,
# 'o' = Lite/Dark, 'r' = Red/Fire, 'g' = Green/Poison, 'b' = Blue/Elec,
# 'u' = Brown/Earth/Force, 'D' = Dark/etc, 'W' = Stone/Inertia/Gravity/etc,
# 'v' = Multihued/Chaos/Disenchantment/etc, 'y' = Gold/Sound, 'R' = Nexus,
# 'G' = Nether, 'B' = Left-overs, and 'U' = Bronze/Confusion).

# In several situations, two or more monsters with identical symbols and
# colors were changed so that maximal information is conveyed by the symbol
# and color.

# The "people" (p), with more than 50 entries, got a new "color scheme"
# ('w' = Paladin, 's' = Knight, 'o' = Mystic, 'r' = Mage, 'g' = High Priest,
# 'b' = Thief, 'u' = Warrior, 'D' = Death knight, 'W' = Ranger/Archer,
# 'v' = Sorcerer, 'y' = Ninja, 'R' = High Mage, 'G' = Priest, 'B' = High
# Thief, 'U' = High Warrior).  Note that most non-unique "people" already
# had these colors, or colors close to these colors.  A similar color scheme
# was enforced for the "humanoid" (h) monsters as well, more or less.

# Many of the "unique" monsters were changed to "match" the "base" monster
# from which they were derived.  Angband 2.8.0 may require every "unique"
# monster to be based on a "normal" monster, and may enforce color matching.
# This may result in the addition of some new monsters, to serve as "base"
# monsters, possibly including Ogre captains, Greater Balrogs, Black Trolls,
# Vampire Queens, Giant Werewolfs, and others.  This may be accompanied by
# a separation of the monster list into a "normal" monster list (r_info)
# with 512 entries, and a "unique" monster list (u_info) with 128 entries,
# which will require reorganization of the list.  Some new "player ghost"
# unique monsters will probably be added at the same time.

# Mushrooms look just like food (and use the "," symbol for both the recall
# window and for normal display), Creeping coins look just like coins (and
# use the "$" symbol for both the recall window and for normal display), and
# Trappers/Lurkers can never be seen (and use the "." symbol for the recall
# window).  All other monsters use "alphabetic" symbols, and "alphabetic"
# symbols are used only for monsters.

# The "0" and "9" symbols are reserved for internal debugging use.

# The "&" symbol is reserved for future use as a special "terrain feature".

# The "`" symbol is reserved as an "alternate" open door picture, since
# the "'" symbol looks like the "," symbol in some fonts (esp. IBM).

# The "x" symbol is free for use as an "attr/char mapping" for annoying
# monsters, such as magic mushrooms, drolems, etc.

# Certain symbols ("X", "Y", "B", "l", "I", etc) are used by
# very few monsters, and could be reorganized somewhat.
# Changes.
# 'e' for equipment
# 'B' for Beast-men (was birds) (replaces 'k' 'H')
# 'A' is for automata
# 'C' is for construct
# 'M' is for monkey
# 'a' is for alien

# There are still too many "p" monsters, perhaps they should be broken up.

# As always, you can enforce any "visual picture" you want with a "pref file".

# Note that monster zero contains the "player" picture.

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Black        W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
# armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
# from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
# intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, and experience for
# killing. The third slot is unused.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
# from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
# damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
# number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
# one of its spells. X must not be zero.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
# ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.

D:This man was of a moderate size, and with a black negroid face. 
D:He had a large, almost lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms, 
D:long thin feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face thrust 
D:forward staring at us. He was dressed like Montgomery and his 
D:white-haired companion, in jacket and trousers of blue serge. 
D:As we came still nearer, this individual began to run to and 
D:fro on the beach, making the most grotesque movements. 
D:The man had pointed ears, covered with a fine brown fur!"

D:"A youngish man with flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured

D:He had watery grey eyes, oddly void of expression. Then just

D:"His height was considerably below the average, his 
D:skull was as small as his shoulders were broad. But 
D:it was not his stature, his shoulders, or the size 
D:of his head which caused the curious effect I have 
D:elsewhere described. It was his eyes, the shape of his 
D:face, the multitudinous wrinkles that lined it, and, 
D:above all, the extraordinary colour of his skin, 
D:that rendered his appearance so repulsive. To understand 
D:what I mean you must think first of old ivory, and then 
D:endeavor to realize what the complexion of a corpse 
D:would be like after lying in an hermetically sealed 
D:tomb for many years. Blend the two, and you will have 
D:some dim notion of the idea I am trying to convey. His 
D:eyes were small, deeply sunken, and in repose apparently 
D:devoid of light and even of life. He wore a heavy fur coat, 
D:and...he disdained the customary headgear of polite society, 
D:and had substituted for it a curious description of cap...he 
D:walked feebly, supporting himself with a stick, upon which 
D:his thin yellow fist was clutched till the knuckles stood 
D:out and shone like billiard balls in the moonlight."

D:a little buff-coloured pamphlet, to read which made one 
D:shiver and creep. . . .
D:Was this the same Moreau? He had published some very astonishing 
D:facts in connection with the transfusion of blood, and in addition 
D:was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly 
D:his career was closed. A journalist obtained 
D:access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with 
D:the deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help 
D:of a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became 
D:notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and otherwise 
D:mutilated, escaped from Moreaus house. . . It was not the first time that 
D:conscience has turned against the methods of research. The doctor was 
D:simply howled out of the country. . . . 
D:Yet some of his experiments, by the journalists account, were wantonly 
D:cruel. He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his 
D:investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men would 
D:who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research. He was 
D:unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider." 
D:- H. G. Wells "The Island of Dr. Moreau"

D:"Imagine a person, tall, lean and feline, high-shouldered, 
D:with a brow like Shakespeare and a face like Satan, a close-shaven 
D:skull, and long, magnetic eyes of the true cat-green. Invest him 
D:with all the cruel cunning of an entire Eastern race, accumulated 
D:in one giant intellect, with all the resources of science past 
D:and present, with all the resources, if you will, of a wealthy 
D:government--which, however, already has denied all knowledge 
D:of his existence. Imagine that awful being, and you have a 
D:mental picture of Dr. Fu-Manchu, the yellow peril incarnate 
D:in one man."-- Nayland Smith to Dr. Petrie, The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu
