# === Understanding monster.txt ===
# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
# W: depth : rarity : monster stealth (was unused) : experience for kill
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Black        W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# (note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and
# thus the monster will appear to be an empty black space if its
# color is "d".)

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
# armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
# from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
# intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, and experience for
# killing. The third slot is for monster stealth.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
# from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
# damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
# number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
# one of its spells. X must not be zero. If X is 1, the monster will
# never move while the player is in sight, and will thus never attack
# in melee, as it will cast spells every turn: if the monster is to use
# a melee attack, then X must be 2 or greater.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster.

# === Understanding monster.txt flags ===

# UNIQUE monsters are just "special" monster races, with the requirement
# that only one monster of that race can exist at a time, and when it is
# killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters appear the same color as the floor, terrain feature or
# object underneath them.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters are "multi-hued" - they change color, every player turn.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters are totally invisible: the symbol shown on the screen
# is the same as the floor (or other terrain feature) below it, or the item
# that is lying on that floor. These monsters can currently be targetted as
# normal monsters: perhaps this can be changed so that the player must KNOW
# the monster is there (by bumping into it, or having the monster wake up
# and attack the player?)

# CHAR_MULTI monsters are those which look like objects, and use the symbols
# of objects. They are in plain sight, but the character should not know that
# a monster is there. At the moment, such monsters can be targetted normally
# (which means that this flag currently has no effect), but this may change
# in the future, as with CHAR_CLEAR monsters.

# (Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see... if you "l"ook
# for them, you will find them unless they are invisible and you cannot
# see invisible, and if you use the * command for targetting mode you
# can pick them as a target.)

# ToDo: Explain the other monster and spell flags.  But maybe in another file.

# Some monster descriptions are taken from the online dictionary at:
# http://encarta.msn.com/
