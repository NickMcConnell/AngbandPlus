?:[EQU $QUEST72 Taken InProgress]
D:Some nights ago, a local woman heard a dreadful scream from the cellar
D:next door and ran down to investigate. She found her neighbor's mutilated
D:body lying in a pool of blood on the cellar floor, with terrible scratch
D:marks on his face and firewood still in his arms; there was no sign of the
D:assailant or assailants. Spooked, she ran for her life and reported the
D:incident to us immediately. We sent an officer in to investigate, he was
D:thrown back out by an invisible force as easily as if he had been a cheap
D:rag doll. I know not what horrors you will face, I only know that this may
D:well be your most dangerous mission yet, and hope I am not sending you to
D:your death. Good luck, and may the gods protect you.
