# The Angwilian Stables
# New quest for FrogComposband 7.1.liquorice

?:[EQU $QUEST98 Taken InProgress]
D:Some time ago, a well-meaning chap from the elf-town of Angwil tried
D:to open a livery stable here; but the beasts he offered for hire
D:were completely untamed and too vile to be ridden, and his business
D:failed miserably. The Angwilian left the town in humiliation;
D:unfortunately, the beasts and the stables are still here, and
D:the smell and reputation of the place are driving visitors away.
D:We're not getting the steady inflow of new customers I need;
D:and even the locals prefer to stay indoors where the stench is
D:not as bad, making them harder to rob. I would appreciate it
D:if you cleaned the old place up a bit.

?:[EQU $QUEST98 Completed]
D:Thank you! I look forward to going out without a clothespin on my nose.
?:1

?:[EQU $QUEST98 Failed]
D:Too bad. I guess there's nothing for it but to try to divert the river to
D:wash the place out.
