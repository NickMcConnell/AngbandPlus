PORTRALIS 0.5 COMPLETE ABILITIES GUIDE
-------------------------------------------

This guide deals about every abilities for every classes. This
is a must for everyone, as it contains the basic of all abilities
in the game. Each classes have 10 abilities. Each of them is
described, has information about how raising it helps, and also
offers some advice on how to use it properly.

ADDITIVE VS MULTIPLICATIVE BONUS

Passive abilities that provides bonus are additive with each
others. This means that if a passive ability gives you +10%
to damages, and another one gives you +15%, then the total
bonus is 25% to damages. Active abilities, such as Spin Attack
and other special attacks, are multiplicative. This means that
the bonus is applied to the total bonus after the passive
have been taken into account.

For example, let's say you normally deal 100 damages per blows.
You have a passive ability that gives you +50% damages, and you
decide to use a level 5 Spin Attack, which gives +100% damages.
First, the passive bonus will be applied, raising your damages
to 150. Then Spin Attack is applied to 150, raising your damages
to 300.

Note that there could be exceptions to this rule, some passive
abilities might be multiplicative. If this is the case, it will
be specified in the ability's description.

RESISTANCE ROLLS

Some abilities can be resisted by monsters. In that case, you
will see "Resist:", followed by a description of what the resistance
roll is based on. For example, Accurate Strike has a "Resist" that
says: (Melee Skill) vs (Evasion)

This means that if you use Accurate Strike, your chance of success is
based on your Fighting skill + any specialized weapon skill you might
be using, versus the Evasion skill of the monster.

A number from 1 to (Melee Skill) will be rolled, and compared to a
number from 1 to (Evasion). If your number is equal or higher than the
monster's roll, the ability will succeed. Otherwise, it will fail.

WARRIOR
---------

1. Spin Attack(Active/melee, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Damage all enemies around you.
Damage: Normal melee damage + 20%.
Radius: 1
Extra points: +20% to damage.

Spin attack does damage to enemies around you, but it can be
very useful against single enemies as well, since the bonus
damage per points is quite high. The type of damage dealt
is dependent on your weapon's damage type.

2. Thrown Weapons Training(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases damage dealt when throwing items at enemies.
        At higher levels, also allows you to throw more than one item
        per turns.
Bonus to Throwing damage: +15%
Extra points: +15% to Throwing damage.
              +1 extra throw for every 10 points.

This passive ability increase damage dealt with thrown weapons.
Since throwing damage are based on strength, like melee damage,
Throwing can be a good complementary skill to melee fighters who are
looking for some ranged attacks.

3. Balanced Warrior(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases Strength and Constitution.
Bonus: +10% to Strength and Constitution. Based on base stat value.
Extra points: +10% to Strength and Constitution.

This passive ability increase your strength and constitution, the
two most important attributes for a melee warrior. Note that the
bonus is based on the attribute's base value, so bonus from items
will not be counted.

4. Battle Skill(Passive, level 1)

Effect: A passive ability that improves all aspects of melee fighting.
Bonus to hit roll: +5%
Bonus to melee damage: +5%
Bonus to block roll: +5%
Bonus to AC: +5%
Extra points: +5% to all bonus.

This is a jack-of-all-trades passive ability that will give you multiple
bonus to your melee fighting. While there are more powerful abilities
for each of these individual attributes, this ability will raise all of
them.

5. Accurate Strike(Active/melee, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: An attack that has a high chance to hit.
Damage: Normal melee damage + 10%.
Resist: (Melee Skill) vs (Evasion)
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +5% to Resist roll.

If successful, this ability will have a guaranteed hit against any monsters
you use it on. This will bypass any dodge rolls and block rolls, as well
as many passive abilities monsters may have. If it fails, however, it doesn't
mean that you miss. The normal hit rolls will then proceed normally.
In addition to it's high accuracy, it also deals more damage than a regular
attack, so this is a very good ability if you want to fight enemies that
are difficult to hit and/or have high defense.

"Melee Skill" refers to Fighting + Specialized weapon skill(with specialized
counting as 150%, as usual).

6. Improved Combat Feats(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improved your Combat Feats skill.
Bonus: +50% to Combat Feats skill. (based on base skill value)
Extra points: +50% to Combat Feats skill.

Combat Feats is a skill that allows you to replace your normal attacks by
special moves instead, such as Spin Attack or Accurate Strike. This ability
provides a considerable 50% increase to the skill. Merely placing two points
in this ability will double your Combat Feats skill.

Though this ability can buff your Combat Feat skill to high levels, keep
in mind that it will be useless if you don't have enough attacks per
turns to use it. The ideal amount to have is your total number of attacks
per turns * 5, so if you have 3 attacks per turns, you need 15 points
of Combat Feats. Therefore, this ability is probably better for characters
who wants to focus on smaller, faster weapons such as Daggers or other
light weapons.

7. Irresistible Hits(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Your melee and throwing attacks treats enemy's Physical resistance
        with a penality. Also gives a bonus to melee and throwing damage.
Bonus to melee and throwing damage: +10%
Penality to Physical resistance: -3
Extra points: +10% to melee and throwing damage.
              -3 to Physical resistance.

With this ability, monsters Physical resistance is treated with a penality,
thus making it possible to harm enemies such as ghosts and spirits without
the need of having an elemental weapon or using magic. It will also improve
your melee and throwing damage.

Note that this does not actually lower the monster's Physical resistance.
It treats it as lower than it is. For example, if you have 10 points in
this ability, and attack a ghost which normally has 100% resistance, the
ghost would be treated as having 70% resistance instead.

It is also important to note that the ability will not reduce the resistance
below 0. So if the monster has 25% resistance and you have 20 points in this
ability(and therefore -60 to resistance), the resistance will be treated as 0.

8. Counter Attack(Passive/melee, level 6)

Effect: Attempt to strike the enemy after it tries to hit you.
Damage: Normal melee damage + 10%.
Element: Weapon's damage type.
Extra points: +10% to damage.

With this ability, whenever an enemy attacks you with a melee attack,
you will respond with a single, powerful attack of your own. This ability
is very powerful against melee attackers, especially if they have multiple
attacks.

Note that the counter attack is performed with the main hand weapon, and
will only work if you have a weapon equipped. It will not work with unarmed
attacks.

9. Leaping Spin(Active/melee, level 6)

Effect: Jump, then perform a spin attack upon landing.
Damage: Normal melee damage + 40%.
Jump Distance: 3
Radius: 1
Extra points: +40% to damage.
	      +1 to jump distance for every 10 points.
              +1 to radius for every 20 points.

Leaping Spin can be used as an opening move to jump into melee against an
opponent and deal damage in the process, or as an escape move if you are
threatened and need to escape. If you decide to put many points in it, the
radius will become larger, and it can become a powerful area-of-effect
ability.

10. Weapons Mastery(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Improves melee damage, and gives you a bonus to all specialized
        weapon skills.
Bonus to melee damage: +10%
Bonus to all specialized weapons skills: +10% (based on base skill value)
Extra points: +10% to melee damage.
              +10% to specialized weapons skills.

This passive ability will increase all melee damage by 10%, and also
increase Swords, Blunt, Polearms, Axes, Daggers and Mining skills by
10% for every points, based on your base skill value. Higher skills
means a better chance to hit and also reduce the effectiveness of
the enemy's defense, raising your damage.

FIGHTER
---------

1. Sheer Power(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Greatly increases all melee damage.
Bonus to melee damage: +20%
Extra points: +20% to melee damage.

This passive ability provides a very powerful increase to all melee damage.
While the damage increase is very high, don't forget that enemies with very
high AC might end up mitigating a lot of damage, and since this ability has
no other benefits, it could lose some of it's usefulness. On the other hand,
against enemies with lower AC, this ability can be devastating.

2. Defensive Fighting(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Use Fighting skill to help evading attacks. Also provides a small
        melee damage increase.
Bonus to dodge: +10% of Fighting skill to dodge rolls.
Bonus to melee damage: +10%
Extra points: +10% to bonus.
              +10% to melee damage.
              With 10 or more points, you also receive a bonus to rolls for
              dodging magical spells(only for dodging, not for additional
              magic damage mitigation).

This passive ability allows you to use your Fighting skill for the purpose
of evading attacks. With 10 points in this ability, the Fighting skill will
not only increase your damage, it will be as powerful as Agility for the
purpose of dodging attacks, and as powerful as Magic Defense for the purpose
of dodging spells(though you do not get the additional benefits of either
skills).

3. Taunt(Active, level 1)

Effect: Affected enemies will leap at you in rage, and attempt to attack you
        in melee combat. You gain bonus melee damage against taunted enemies.
        (treated as a passive melee damage bonus)
Radius: 5
Chance to use spells or ranged attack: -25
Bonus to melee damage vs taunted enemies: +20%
Resist: (Fighting + Charisma) vs (Level + Mind)
Extra points: +10% to resist roll.
              -1 to chance to use Magic or Ranged attack.
              +20% bonus to melee damage.
              +1 to radius for every 5 points.
              With 10 or more points, this ability becomes a Ball effect that
              you can project from a distance, and control it's targetting.
              It allows you to pull enemies to you from a long distance.

All enemies that are successfully afflicted will instantly leap around you,
and will gain +3 to their speed. While taunted, their chance to cast spells
or use ranged attacks will be reduced, possibly becoming 0 and forcing them
to melee you, and your own melee attacks will deal more damage.

Elites, Bosses and Uniques, as well as enemies with a CR of 2 or higher,
can break from being taunted. Every turns, a new resist roll is made, and if
they succeed, the Taunt effect will wear off. The monster's roll will be
multiplied by (CR-1), so do not expect this effect to last long against
really powerful enemies. They also do not lose the speed gain.

4. Critical Hits(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Your attacks have a chance to ignore the monster's AC. If used while
        in Power Attack mode, it also has a chance to paralyze, and a higher
        succcess rate.
Paralysis duration: 2 turns
Resist: (10% of Fighting) vs (Strength + Evasion)
Extra points: +10% to resist roll.
              Uses an additional 10% of your Fighting skill, until you get
              10 points, where your skill will be fully used.

This passive ability gives a chance to all your attacks to ignore the monster's
AC, and thus deal full damage. To show the effectiveness of a critical hits,
let's assume a Fighting skill of 100, 5000 damage, 10 points in Critical Hits,
and a monster with an AC of 200. If the critical hit is unsuccessful,
the monster will get 66% damage reduction, and will end up taking 1700 damage.
If Critical hits is successful, the monster will take the full 5000 damage,
almost three times more damage. Critical Hits are especially useful against
enemies with very high defenses.

If you use this while in Power Attack mode, it also has a chance to paralyze
the enemy(assuming it isn't immune to paralysis). Also, you gain a bonus to
your roll. Your strength is added, and then you get x2 for level 1
power attack, x3 for level 2 and x4 for level 3.

5. Overwhelming Strength(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Greatly increases strength.
Bonus: +20% to Strength. Based on base stat value.
Extra points: +20% to strength.

This ability provides a great increase to strength. Strength increases your
base melee damage, as well as increasing the number of attacks you can make
per turns, and helps with blocking and carrying a heavier load.
Best used with races that already have a bonus to strength, such as
Zulgors or Dwarves.

Compared to the Warrior's Balanced Warrior ability, this one is twice as
powerful. However, it doesn't raise constitution.

6. Fighting Specialist(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases your chance to hit and ability to pierce defense based on
        your Fighting skill. Also increase melee damage.
Bonus to hit/bypass AC: +10% of Fighting skill.
Bonus to melee damage: +10%
Extra points: +10% bonus.
              +10% to melee damage.

This passive ability allows you to add additional points to your rolls to
hit enemies, and pierce their defenses. Essentially, with only 5 points
in this ability, Fighting becomes as good as any of the specialized skills,
and can become even better with more points. This allows you to pick up
any weapons you find, and use it to it's full potential!

7. High Speed Charge(Active, level 6)

Effect: An extremely high speed charge toward an enemy. The further the
        distance, the more powerful the impact. Be careful not to hit
        a wall though!
Damage: Normal melee damage.
Various bonus based on the distance travelled(cumulative):
1 grid: +20% damage for every points.
3 grids: Speed modifier added as a percentile passive damage bonus(if positive)
5 grids: +20% damage for every points.
7 grids: +20% chance to hit for every points.
10 grids: +20% damage for every points.
          Has a chance to stun enemies that are not immune to paralysis.
          The roll is based on (Strength + Fighting + Speed) vs
          (Strength + Evasion), and the roll increases by 10% for every
          points. Paralysis lasts for 2 turns.
15 grids: +20% damage for every points.
20 grids: +20% damage for every points.

Total bonus damage are multiplicative with other passive bonus.

Extra points: See above.

High Speed Charge allows you to charge at great speed in a given direction.
When you choose the direction, you will keep moving that way until you hit
an obstacle. If you hit a monster, the monster will take damage, and might
even become stunned if you charge from far enough. However, if you hit
a wall, you will not be able to act for a number of turns equal to the
distance you travelled while charging.

8. Unavoidable Power Attacks(Passive, level 6)

Effect: While in Power Attack mode, guarantees that some damage will go
        through, even if the monster dodges.
Damage avoided: 88%
Extra points: -2% to avoided damage.

This ability will make sure that your Power Attacks will at least do some
damage, even if they are avoided. At 10 points, the monster will at least
take 30% of your damage, which will pretty much guarantee that some good
damage will go through.

This ability works well with Critical Hits, since it will gives you
a chance to paralyze every times you use a Power Attack, since the hit
always connect.

In theory, if you were to place 46 or more points, the avoided damage
would become "negative", resulting in the monster taking more damage
when doding your attacks than actually taking the hit. However, for the
tiny damage increase this would provide for the amount of points spent,
this is definitely not a good idea.

9. All-In-One Strike(Active/melee, level 6)

Effect: A melee attack that multiply it's damage by the total number of
        attacks that you have. Only usable in Power Attack mode.
Damage: (Normal melee damage * extra attacks) +20%
Extra points: +20% to damage.

This ability deals an amount of damage based on the total number of attacks
that you have, and is only usable in Power Attack mode. Power Attacks are
powerful, but limited to one attack, and so under normal circumstances,
it doesn't take advantage of having multiple extra attacks. This ability
fixes this problem by allowing you to maximize your attack potential into
one, powerful move.

10. Love of Battle(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Increase melee damage, power attack duration and allow you to
        perform deadly counter attacks while in Power Attack mode.
Bonue to melee damage: +10%
Bonus to power attack duration: 1
Counter attacks damage: Normal melee damage + 10%.
Extra points: +10% to melee damage.
              +1 to Power Attacks duration.
              +10% to Counter Attack damage.

This powerful ability provides a bonus to melee damage, as well as increasing
the duration of power attacks. Normally, when you enter Power Attack mode,
after spending two or more turns, you have one turn to make your attack.
This increase will make it so that you have more than one turn, allowing more
preparation, or proper positioning.

But the counter attack is probably this ability's greatest strength. While in
Power Attack mode, you will be able to perform counter attacks to any enemies
who tries to hit you. This special counter attack will NOT break Power Attack,
allowing you multiple, powerful counter attacks while you charge up and
prepare your attack. And of course, with extended duration, nothing prevents
you from sitting in place, and rely entirely on the counter to defeat your
foes!

Note that while in power attack mode, this ability will override the
Warrior's Counter Attack ability. Both will not activate at the same time.

MAGE
------

1. Wizardry(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases your Intelligence and your maximum mana.
Bonus to Intelligence: +10% (based on base stat value)
Bonus to Mana: +10%
Extra points: +10% to Intelligence and mana.

This ability raises your Intelligence and your maximum mana. Having a lot
of mana will help casting more powerful spells(or endless casting of
weaker spells), and more Intelligence will raise the power of these spells
even further.

2. Improved Combat Spells(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases power of damage dealing Elemental, Mysticism and
        Conjuration spells. (does not affect Life Blast and Divination)
        Also makes them harder to avoid.
Bonus to damage: +10%
Bonus to hit rolls: +10%
Extra points: +10% to damage and to hit rolls.

This ability will increase the power of your damage dealing spells, and
also make them more likely to hit. Some enemies have very high Magic Defense
skill, and can be very hard to hit with spells. This ability will help
in these situations.

3. Magic Missiles(Active/Passive, level 1)

Effect: Cast magic missiles at enemies. Also improve the damage of magic
        attacks of the 'Missile' element, and reduce the creation cost
        of Missile-based spells.
Power: 3 (Intelligence)
Bonus to Missile spells and magic attacks: +10%
Creation cost reduction: 9%
Type: Missile
Extra points: +3 to Power.
              +10% to Missile damage.
              -3% to creation cost(up to a maximum of 67%).
              +1 additional missile every 10 points.

This ability provides both an attack of it's own, and also a passive bonus
to all Missile-based spells and magic attacks(meaning it also affect
Missile-based damage from rods, for example). The Missile element is a
Physical/Mana hybrid, meaning it does half Physical, half Mana damage,
and since very few monsters resists both types(especially Mana), Missile
will almost always have some effects. Because of this advantage, and
because it's available right at the start of the game, it's creation cost
is three times higher than other Elemental spells.

This ability makes this extra cost a better investment by raising the
damage of Missile-based spells. It also reduce the creation cost, and if
you place enough points, the cost can reach 67% reduction, at which point
it will cost as much as other Elemental spells.

The ability also provides an attack of it's own. It uses the same damage
formula as normal spells, and is based on Intelligence. It benefits from
both Spellcraft and Elemental for bypassing Magic Defense.

4. Spell Absorbtion(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Regain mana from enemy spells, and gives you a chance to absorb
        the spell and prevent all damage and effects.
Power(prevention): 10% of (Intelligence + Wisdom + Magic Defense) vs
                   (Mind + Magic skill)
Mana restoration: 1% of spell's power.
Extra points: +10% to absorbtion roll.
              +1% of spell's power to mana restoration.
              An additional 10% of (Int + Wis + MDef) is used for the roll,
              up to a maximum of 100%.

This passive ability offers a second level of protection against magical
spells. Before the standard Magic Defense roll, this ability will trigger,
and if successful, you will prevent all damage from the spell.

Regardless of whether the roll succeeds or not, you will regain mana based
on the spell's power and this ability's level. At higher levels, this can
be a very potent source of mana recovery.

5. Explosive Spells(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases the power of your damage spells and their area of effect.
Bonus to damage: +10%
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +1 to radius of all damage spells for every 5 points.

This passive ability increases damage of spells, and increases their area
of effect, or give them one if they didn't have one(such as bolt spells).
This allows you to create cheaper bolt spells and still benefit from AoE.
It also works with damaging fields, so placing points in this ability will
allow you to create greater fields using the Field spells(Fire Field, Storms,
etc...). Note that this ability will not raise the AoE of non-damaging
spells, such as Grow Trees. It also won't improve the damage of Life Blast
and Divination(but will give them AoE).

6. Rods Mastery(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improve Rods zapping and activation damage, and give you extra
        zappings per turns. Also improve the mana bonus of rods, and their
        melee damage.
Bonus to Rods zapping power: +20%
Bonus to Rods activations power: +50%
Bonus to Rods mana bonus: +20%
Bonus to Rods melee damage: +10%
Extra points: +20% to Rods zapping power.
              +50% to Rods activations power.
              +20% to Rods mana bonus.
              +10% to Rods melee damage.
              +1 rod zapping per turns for every 10 points.

This passive ability gives you several bonus when using rods. From extra
zappings per turns, to melee damage bonus, this ability improves almost
all feature of rods and classes(melee weapon that gives mana and makes
spells stronger, while providing magical powers of their own). If you want
to specialize in using rods and staves for more than a simple buff to
spells, this ability is heavily recommended.

The bonus to "Rods mana bonus" applies to the bonus given by rods, and not
to your total mana. For example, if you have a rod that gives you +20% to
mana, and you have 5 points in this ability, the rod will now give you
+40% to your mana.

7. Spells Efficiency(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Improves the success rate of resistable spells effects(such as most
        Alteration spells, Harm, Divination, Warp's teleport effect, etc...),
        and gives a bonus to all magic attacks for the purpose of bypassing
        Magic Defense.
Bonus to Magic Defense rolls of all magic attacks: +10%
Bonus to resistance rolls of all spells: +10%
Extra points: +10% to Magic Defense rolls of all spells.
              +10% to resistance rolls of all spells.

This ability will make all spells you cast more likely to hit, and less
of their power mitigated by the monster's Magic Defense. It will also
improve rolls of all spells that requires a successful roll for their
effect to trigger. Therefore, this ability is best suited for mages who wants
to specialize in the schools of Alteration or Divination.

It's also worth noting that the bonus to Magic Defense rolls apply to ALL
magic attacks, not just spells. That means that if you have another magical
ability from another class, or an item's activation, they will also get the
bonus.

8. Improved Activation(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Improves the effects of offensive/healing item activations.
Activation's power bonus: +50%
Extra points: +50% to activation power.

This passive ability improve the effects of magical item activations.
Many artifacts, and some other objects(such as rods and a couple others)
have special activations that can unleash special powers. This ability
will make them more effective, sometimes much more so, if you also raise
intelligence or wisdom to improve the base damage. Note that this only
improves the damage of magic-based activations. Special melee or ranged
attacks are not affected.

9. Advanced Teleportation(Active/Passive, level 6)

Effect: Allows you to control where you appear when you teleport. Also, if
        you target a monster, gives you a chance to exchange positions.
Maximum teleport radius: 2
Resist: (Int + Wis + Spellcraft + Alteration) vs (Mind + Magic Defense)
Extra points: +2 to maximum to teleport radius.
              +10% to resistance roll.

When you use teleportation(such as the 'Alter Position' Alteration spell,
scrolls of phase door, etc...), you will be prompted if you want to use
Advanced Teleportation. If you do, you will be able to control where
you appear, up to the maximum distance that the teleportation allowed. This
ability will only trigger if the teleportation's power is equal or lower than
the maximum teleport radius of this ability. For example, a scroll of
phase door has a power of 10, so you need at least 5 points in this ability
to use it with scrolls of phase door.

If you use it, and you select a grid with a monster on it, you will be able to
exchange positions with the monster(assuming it doesn't resist). This could be
used for escaping, closing distance with a pack of monsters, and many other
creative uses that you might think about!

Finally, while normal teleportation cannot be used inside of quest levels,
Advanced Teleportation can, so this gives a use to your Alter Position spells
and your scrolls of phase door inside of quest levels. Note that you normally
cannot Advance Teleport on unlit grids or walls, although if there is a
monster on the grid, you can exchange positions. Beware not to get stuck
though!

10. Aftermath(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Monsters struck by your spells have a chance to get struck by the
        same spell once again.
Resist: 10% of (Int + Wis + Spellcraft) vs (Mind + Magic Defense)
Extra points: +10% to resistance roll.
              An additional 10% of (Int + Wis + Spellcraft) is used, up to
              a maximum of 100% at 10 points.

With this powerful ability, your spells will have a chance to affect the
monsters a second time. This apply to every times the monster is struck,
so if you can cast a multi-effect spell, all effects have a chance to strike
the monster twice. This ability can be very powerful if used in combination
with large radius "chain" spells, since they strike the monsters multiple
times.

Note that all aftermaths are applied with a radius of 0. Also, an aftermath
cannot cause another aftermath.

ROGUE
-------

Rogue Weapons: Several of the Rogue abilities will reference 'Rogue' weapons.
               This refers to melee weapons that have their damage increased
               by Dexterity(such as daggers and short swords) and to one-handed
               ranged weapons, such as one-handed crossbows or pistols. Many of
               the Rogue's abilities will give you bonus when using these
               weapons.


1. Stealthy Fighter(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Use your Stealth skill to act as Fighting and Shooting skill, and also
        provides damage bonus when using 'Rogue' weapons. Will only work if
        wearing soft or no armor.
% of Stealth used: 10%
Bonus to Stealth: 5% of base Stealth.
Bonus to Melee and Ranged damage(when using Rogue weapons): 10%
Extra points: +10% of Stealth used(up to a maximum of 100% at 10 points).
              +10% bonus melee and ranged damage when using Rogue weapons.
              +5% of base Stealth to Stealth.

This passive ability allows you to use your Stealth as a skill to improve
both your melee and shooting abilities, while retaining all the benefits of
the Stealth skill. Stealth is very useful to avoid being attacked by enemies,
and this ability will allow you to raise it while allowing it to contribute
to your damage. Though the weapons restriction is more restricted than the
true Fighting skill, it can be used for both melee and ranged weapons.

Note that this ability will not provide any benefits if you are wearing
hard or dragon armor.

2. Thievery(Active/Passive, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Steal items from enemies. Experienced Rogues have a sixth sense when
        it comes to getting valuable goods, and everything they steal tends
        to be quite valuable. Also, this ability improves your ability to
        unlock chests, and allows you to unlock magical chests.
Resist: (Dexterity + Stealth) vs (Dexterity + Evasion)
Bonus to_h/to_d: +5%, and then +1
Bonus to_ac(only if the item already has base AC): +1
Bonus to melee weapons and ammos base damage: +1d1, and then +2%.
Bonus to ranged weapons damage multiplier: +1%
Bonus to base AC: +2%
Bonus to Lockpicking rolls: +50%
Stolen gold is multiplier by this ability's level.
Extra points: +10% to Resist roll.
              +5% to_h/to_d, and then an additional +1.
              +1 to_ac if the item bas base AC.
              +2% to base AC.
              +2%(1% for ranged multipliers) to weapons damage.
              +1 free bonus point on item for every 2 points.
              +50% to Lockpicking rolls.
              For every points, 500 golds is added to the maximum value of
              stolen items that you may keep when you die.

              -- Unlockable chests --
              1+ points: Allows you to attempt unlocking Magic chests.
              5+ points: Allows you to attempt unlocking Cursed chests.
              10+ points: Allows you to attempt unlocking Ancient chests.
                          Also, guarantees 100% success rate on Iron chests.
              20+ points: Guarantees 100% success rate on Large Steel chests.
              30+ points: Allows you to attempt unlocking Strange chests.
              40+ points: Guarantees 100% success rate on Magic chests.
              50+ points: Guarantees 100% success rate on Cursed chests.
              75+ points: Guarantees 100% success rate on Ancient chests.
              100 points: Guarantees 100% success rate on Strange chests.

This ability allows you to attempt stealing one of the items carried by the
enemy. If you succeed, you will obtain an enhanced version of the item, which
will have higher base values and bonus. This is an ability that rewards you
for using it a lot. If you only steal an occasional item, it won't help much.
But steal a full set of equipment, and the added bonus to every stolen item
will pay off a lot.

For every points, 500 golds is added to the maximum value of stolen items that
you may keep when you die. Normally, all items with a value of 1000 or lower
will not be gone when you die. However, if you have 10 points in this ability,
you may keep stolen items with a value of up to 6000. This only applies to
items stolen using this ability.

Note that this ability is not usable in quest levels.

Also note that the total effective ability level for enhancing stolen items
cannot exceed 100. This means that if you have 100 points in Thievery and 100
points in Flight of the Guilty, it will cap at 100 for the purpose of enhancing
items.

3. Rogue Weapons Mastery(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases damage of 'Rogue' weapons.
Bonus damage: +20%
Extra points: +20% to damage with 'Rogue' weapons.

This passive ability will increase your damage with 'Rogue' weapons. At +20%
per points, this is quite a significant bonus, especially since it applies
to both melee and ranged weapons. The ability will give you both power
and versatility.

4. Improved Dodge(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improves your dodge rolls for avoiding melee and ranged attacks.
Bonus to dodge rolls: +20%
Extra points: +20% to dodge rolls.

This passive ability greatly enhance your ability to dodge incoming attacks.
Dexterity, in addition to providing accuracy, also improves your dodging
ability, and as a Rogue, since your Dexterity is most likely going to be
pretty high, this ability will complement it nicely. It will also make up
for having to use light armors if you focus on Stealth.

5. Flight of the Guilty(Passive, level 1)

Effect: When successfully stealing an item from an uninjured monster,
        you will teleport away as if you had used a scroll of Phase Door,
        and will temporarely gain a bonus to speed. This ability is also
        cumulative with Thievery for the purpose of improving stolen
        items(but doesn't increase the chance to steal).
Distance: 2
Haste duration: 1
Extra points: +2 to distance.
              +1 to Haste duration.
              Improves stolen items as if you had placed points in Thievery,
              but doesn't increase the chance to steal or affect ability to
              open chests.

You may turn this ability on or off using the 'K' command. It is on by default
when you place points in it.

This ability allows you to escape after stealing an item. This ensures that you
will actually keep the item and the enemy won't counter and kill you, but it's
also useful to attempt stealing items from enemies that are too powerful to be
defeated. You don't kill them, but run away with their loot!

Note that this only works on uninjured enemies. If you wound the monster
before stealing from it, this ability will not trigger.

Also note that the total effective ability level for enhancing stolen items
cannot exceed 100. This means that if you have 100 points in Thievery and 100
points in Flight of the Guilty, it will cap at 100 for the purpose of enhancing
items.

6. Sneak Attack(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: A melee attack that can do high damage if used as a combat feat,
        and if you have high Stealth. On successful rolls, has a chance to stun
        enemies that aren't immune to paralysis.
Bonus melee damage if enemy is not damaged(successful roll): +30%
Bonus melee damage(failed roll): +10%
Stun duration: 1 turn.
Resist: (Stealth) vs (Evasion)
Resist(stun): (Stealth) vs (Strength)
Extra points: +30% bonus melee damage on successful rolls(if it's not damaged).
              +10% bonus melee damage on failed rolls.
              +10% to Resist rolls.

This attack makes good use of your Stealth and gives you a chance to do a lot
of damage when using it. If the attack succeeds, you will also have
a chance to briefly stun your foe. While a 1 turn duration is short, it is
enough to prevent immediate retaliation and allows you to attack again.
However, even if the high damage effect fails, you will steal more damage
than you would have using a normal attack, so the ability should always be
used once you learn it. Note that this attack will not reapply the paralysis
effect if the monster is already paralyzed.

Note that for the high damage and stun effects to apply, the ability must
be used through a combat feat, and not as a standalone attack. Also, the high
damage bonus will only work if the monster hasn't already been damaged(just
like stealth only working with undamaged enemies).

7. Art of Poisoning(Active/Passive, level 6)

Effect: Changes a weapon's or ammo's damage type to Poison. Improves the
        damage of Poison melee and ranged attacks, and allow them to
        ignore resistances.
Bonus to Poison melee and ranged damage: +10%
Resistances ignored: 3%
Extra points: +10% to Poison damage.
              +3% resistances ignored.

This ability can be used to change a weapon's damage type to Poison.
As a passive bonus, it will improve the damage of all Poison-based melee and
ranged attacks, as well as allowing them to ignore some of the resistances
a monster may have. Many monsters are naturally immune to Poison, and this
ability can help you deal with them more easily. Note, however, that the
resistance of the monsters will not drop below 0.

8. Slumber Shot(Active, level 6)

Effect: A sleep-inducing shot that can also deal major to sleeping enemies.
        Only usable with one-handed ranged weapons.
Damage: Base shot damage + 10%.
Maximum shots: 1
Resist: (Dexterity + Shooting + Specialized ranged skill) vs (Strength + Mind)
Does double damage to sleeping enemies.
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +1 maximum shots every 10 points.
              +5% to Resist rolls.

(See the Marksman's section for the mechanics of special ranged abilities)

This ability fires a sleep-inducing shot that will put enemies to sleep if
they fail to resist. At this point, you can either leave them sleeping and
escape safely, or shoot them again with this ability. If you do that, your
shot will do double damage! (but will wake up the monster) Enemies immune
to sleep are unaffected by the sleep effect, but this attack will always
do more damage than a regular shot, so it's still worth using.

If you have placed points in Stealthy Fighter, your Stealth will also
contribute to the Resist roll as if it was the Shooting skill.

9. Stealthy Attacks(Passive, level 6)

Effect: When using Rogue weapons, you make unexpected, sneaky attacks.
        Your attacks with Rogue weapons have a chance to score a guaranteed
        hit.
Resist: (Stealth) vs (Dexterity + Evasion)
Extra points: +10% to Resist rolls.

With this passive ability, all your attacks made with Rogue weapons(melee or
ranged) will have a chance to score a guaranteed hit to enemies. This ability
applies before the standard hit roll, so even if this fails, you still have
a chance to hit your opponent with the regular hit roll. This essentially
gives you a second roll for hitting your opponents.

10. Con Job(Active, level 10)

Effect: Fool uninjured enemies around you into thinking you are very important
        and/or far more powerful than you look, causing them to stop
        attacking you.
Radius: 5
Resist: (Stealth + Charisma) vs Mind
Extra points: +10% to resist roll.
              +1 to radius every 5 points.

Enemies affected by this ability will stop attacking you, and will ignore you
until you attack them, which will break the effect and prevent the ability
from affecting them again. Also, every turns, there is a 25% chance that
CR1 enemies will attempt breaking the effect, in which case a resistance
roll will be made, and if failed, it will break the effect. Enemies of CR2
or higher will get a chance to break the effect every turns.

Note that uniques are unaffected, as are enemies of CR4 and higher(they are
far too powerful to be fooled by your trickeries!).

PRIEST
--------

Blessings: Blessings are abilities that you can activate to provide
           passive bonus that are all based on your total Wisdom. Only one
           blessing can be active at a time, but you can just activate
           another blessing to switch them around. Blessings are permanent
           until you switch to a different blessing.


1. Wisdom Casting Mastery(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improves the power of all offensive and healing spells that are casted
        using wisdom, and also increases the casting success rate by increasing
        your wisdom casting rolls. Also improves your Wisdom.
Bonus to offensive/healing spells power: +10%
Bonus to wisdom-casting success rolls: +10%
Bonus to Wisdom: +10% (based on base Wisdom)
Extra points: +10% to offensive/healing spells power.
              +10% to wisdom-casting success rolls.
              +10% to Wisdom. (based on base Wisdom)

This passive ability will improve the power of all offensive spells that you
cast using Wisdom, and also healing spells, making this ability good for both
offense and hp restoration. It will also increase Wisdom, allowing you to cast
more reliable spells, and make them more powerful.

The ability will also increase the success rate of all wisdom-based spells,
making them more reliable and less likely to fail in times of need. So if you
want powerful and reliable wisdom-based spells, you should definitely consider
placing some points in this ability.

2. Mystical Power(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improves the power of offensive and healing Mysticism spells.
        Also improves their success rate(if applicable), and lowers the
        creation cost of all Mysticism spells, based on your Wisdom. (only
        applies to the first effect)
Bonus to Mysticism spells power: +20%
Bonus to Harm/Drain Life rolls: +(10% of Wisdom)%.
Mysticism creation cost reduction: 10% of Wisdom.
Extra points: +20% to Mysticism spells power.
              +(10% of Wisdom)% to Harm/Drain Life rolls.
              +10% of Wisdom to Mysticism creation cost reduction.

This passive ability lets you specialize in the Mysticism school of magic,
giving you bonus damage with Mysticism spells, and making your healing spells
much more effective. The bonus to the power of those spells isn't tied to
wisdom-based casting, and will apply to any spells or attacks that uses an
attribute that is part of the Mysticism school, be they melee, ranged or magic,
wisdom or mana based. (will also work with potions, songs, etc...)

Normally, Harm and Drain Life requires a successful roll to take effect. This
ability will make these rolls more successful, and if you have a very high
wisdom and many points in this ability, it may even trivialise them.

The creation cost reduction applies to all Mysticism spells. It provides a flat
cost reduction, based on your wisdom. It is applied after the reduction from
a high Mysticism skill. However, note that it will only apply to the first
effect of your spell.

3. Blessing of Protection(Active/Passive, level 1)

Effect: While active, this blessing will increase Defense, Agility and
        Magic Defense.
Bonus to Defense, Agility and Magic Defense: 3% of Wisdom.
Extra points: +3% of Wisdom to Defense, Agility and Magic Defense.

This blessing will give you a buff to all three of the defensive skills,
based on your Wisdom. With sufficiently high wisdom and points in this
ability, you can gain a good bonus to all three skills while this blessing
is active.

4. Sanctify Area(Active, level 1)

Effect: Ward an area with holy power. Mystical beings such as undeads, 
        demons, elementals and celestials won't be able to enter
        it, or will have trouble performing any action if they do.
Radius: 1
Resist: Wisdom vs Mind
Extra points: +10% to resist roll.
              +1 to radius every 5 points.

This ability wards an area with holy power, and will prevent certain
kind of enemies from walking in the warded area. This affects undeads,
demons, elementals/spirits(E), and hostile celestials(A). CR1 enemies
will not enter the area(but will attempt to get out if caught in it).
CR2 enemies and higher, however, might attempt it. If the affected kind
of enemies enter the warded area, they will have to win a resist roll,
or they will be unable to perform any action this turn. Note that friendly
monsters are unaffected. Sanctified areas may only be placed on grids
that you can actually see.

There are two ways of using this ability. You can place wards to block
corridors and prevent enemies from chasing you, or you can directly
place the ward on enemies, so that they will be caught in it and will
be affected by it's effect. Note that the wards are treated like floor
grids, not walls. Enemies can still shoot or cast at you from afar when
behind the ward.

5. Blessing of Faithful Strike(Active/Passive, level 1)

Effect: While active, all your attacks have a chance to become a guaranteed
        hit, based on your Wisdom.
Resist: (10% of Wisdom) vs Mind
Extra points: +(10% of Wisdom) to resist roll, with a maximum of 100%
               at 10 points.
              +10% to resist roll.

This blessing will give you a chance for a guaranteed hit with all your
attacks, be they melee, ranged or magic. This makes the blessing very useful
for any types of characters, and will be helpful when facing powerful enemies
that tends to dodge attacks a lot. The actual success rate depends on this
ability's level, your wisdom, and then monster's mind stat.

6. Blessed Blood(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Gives you passive health regeneration, as if a healing spell was
        cast on you every turns. Additionally, it improves all healing effects
        used on you.
Healing power: 1
Bonus to healing effects: +20%
Extra points: +1 to power every 2 points.
              +20% to healing effects power.

With this ability, an healing effect will be cast on you every turns,
effectively giving you passive health regeneration. The amount of healing you
get is dependant on your Wisdom, using the standard spells power formula,
and although the base power is low, remember that this is always active and
takes no turns. It is also improved by the ability's passive effect, which
applies to all healing effects(whether it be spells, songs, potions or any
other effects).

7. Blessing of Might(Active/Passive, level 6)

Effect: While active, your Strength is increased and you will deal more
        melee damage.
Strength bonus: 10% of Wisdom.
Melee damage bonus: +5%
Extra points: +10% of Wisdom to Strength, up to a maximum of 100% at 10 points.
              +5% to melee damage.

This blessing will increase your Strength by an amount equal to a percentage
of your Wisdom. It will also give you a small passive bonus to melee damage.
With 10 points in this ability, your Strength will be as high as your Wisdom,
allowing you to do melee combat in addition to casting spells.

8. Blessing of Dexterity(Active/Passive, level 6)

Effect: While active, your Dexterity is increased and you will deal more
        ranged damage.
Dexterity bonus: 10% of Wisdom.
Ranged damage bonus: +5%
Extra points: +10% of Wisdom to Dexterity, up to a maximum of 100% at 10 points.
              +5% to ranged damage.

This blessing will increase your Dexterity by an amount equal to a percentage
of your Wisdom. It will also give you a small passive bonus to ranged damage.
With 10 points in this ability, your Dexterity will be as high as your Wisdom,
allowing you to do ranged combat in addition to casting spells.

9. Divine Intervention(Active, level 6)

Effect: Get a powerful Healing spell cast on you, and gain a temporary bonus to
        Defense and Magic Defense, based on your Wisdom.
Healing power: 100
Defense/Magic Defense bonus: 100% of Wisdom.
Duration: 3 turns.
Cooldown: 100 turns.
Extra points: +100 to healing power.
              +20% of Wisdom to Defense/Magic Defense.

This ability is meant to save your life. The dragon's breath really hurts?
Use this to not only get back on your feet, but be granted much improved
defensive capabilities to resist further attacks. If your wisdom is high,
the amount of skill points you may gain can be very high. Combine this
with either Mystical Power or Blessed Blood to greatly improve the healing
spell that is cast on you. The healing power uses the regular spells power
formula, so the higher your Wisdom, the more healing you get.

This ability is powerful, but do be aware of the long cooldown. Keep it for
when you really need it!

10. Remove Curse(Active/Passive, level 10)

Effect: Using holy power, you can remove the evil power from a cursed item.
        This may weaken the item in the process, but it will become safe
        to use it. Also gives you a passive bonus to Wisdom.
Maximum Misfortune for attempt: 1
Bonus to Wisdom: +20% (based on base Wisdom)
Extra points: +10% to rolls.
              +20% to Wisdom.
              +1 to maximum Misfortune for attempt for every 10 points.

Cursed items can be very powerful, but using them has consequences.
This ability allows you to remove the Misfortune from a cursed item, while
keeping it's other bonus. Note that to uncurse items with more than
1 point of Misfortune, you will need to place some points in this ability.

How successful you are at removing the curse depends on your Wisdom and
this ability's level, versus the item's depth level and total bonus points
on the item. High Misfortune will also make it much harder to uncurse
the item properly. The curse will be removed in most cases, but the bonus on the
item will be reduced by a certain percentage, depending on your roll versus
the item's roll.

For example, let's say you have 100 Wisdom and 1 point in this ability. That
gives you a "power" of 120. The item you're trying to uncurse it a depth 20
Steel Long Sword, with a total of 40 points worth of bonus points. That gives
it 60 power. So then it's a roll of 120 vs 60. If you roll 100, and the item
rolls 30, the two rolls will be compared. Out of a total of 130, your roll is
100, and the item has 30. You have 76% of 130, and therefore, the item will
keep 76% of it's bonus. On the other hand, if you were to roll 20, and the
item rolls 50, then out of 70, you have 28%, and the item would lose a lot
of it's power. Note that your game will automatically be saved after uncursing
an item, so you cannot attempt this over and over. It's recommended that you
have a high wisdom and place points in this ability if you plan to use it a
lot. You should also save using this only on new cursed items that you find.
If you've been leveling a cursed item, then use this on it and get a bad roll,
you might lose more bonus than you have invested in the item.

Finally, if you roll below 10% of the total roll, you will fail to uncurse the
item. Furthermore, something bad may happen. So if you find a very powerful
cursed item, but think your Wisdom or your ability's level is too low, think
twice about using trying to uncurse it!

The ability will also give you a significant passive bonus to Wisdom, so this
ability will help making your spells stronger. Think of it as becoming wiser
by resisting the temptation of using cursed items!

MONK
------

1. Power through Spirit(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improves unarmed damages, and allows you to use Wisdom to improve
        unarmed damages, get extra attacks and destroy walls.
Bonus to unarmed damages: +10%
Wisdom added to Strength for damage, attacks, and digging: 10% of Wisdom
Extra points: +10% to unarmed damages.
              +10% of Wisdom added to Strength(up to a maximum of 100%). 

This passive ability will improve your unarmed combat damages, and will also
allow you to add Wisdom to your Strength for melee damages calculation. This
means that with 10 points in this ability, you will no longer need Strength
to improve your melee damages, and instead use Wisdom, meaning you will also
be able to cast spells to complement your melee combat.

Several abilities of the Monk uses Wisdom as the main attribute. Therefore,
this ability is heavily recommended if you want to benefit from the full
extent of the Monk's abilities.

2. Spin Kick(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Does damages to enemies around you.
Damages: Base unarmed damages + 20%.
Radius: 1
Element: Based on gloves. (default Physical)
Extra points: +20% to damages.

Spin kick does physical damages to enemies around you. You can use it to damage
multiple enemies at once, but because of it's high power, it's also very
useful on single enemies. It can be used as a combat, so you can use it as part
of a melee attacks combo, or use it several times in a row if you have
enough points in the Combat Feats skill.

Note that even though the ability is described as a "kick", gloves contributes
to damages and determine the element used, not the boots.

3. Ki Punch(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: A powerful punch infused with inner energy. Does half Physical,
        half Mana damages. (uses the Missile element)
Damages: Base unarmed damages + 20%.
Element: Missile
Extra points: +20% to damages.

This ability allows you to deliver a powerful punch that will deal Missile
damages, meaning half Physical and half Mana. In addition to being a powerful
move, it will almost never be fully resisted by enemies, since you will rarely
find an enemy that resists both Physical and Mana.

4. Throw(Active/Passive, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Attempt to throw an enemy to deal damages and move it away. You will
        also attempt to use this move whenever you dodge an enemy's melee
        attack.
Damages: Base unarmed damages + 10%.
Distance: 3
Element: Physical
Resist: Requires a standard hit roll.
        Monster might be too heavy to throw.
Extra points: +10% to damages.
              +1 to Distance every 5 points.
              Allows you to throw heavier enemies.

This ability allows you to throw enemies. It will deal damages, and also
keep them away from you. It is also used as a defensive ability. Whenever
you successfully dodge an enemy's melee attack, you will automatically
attempt to use this ability. Note that you must be unarmed to use this
ability.

Some kind of monsters are almost always too heavy to throw. It is best to
not waste time trying to throw golems, giants and dragons, for example.

5. Ki Restoration(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Use inner energy to restore your hp, based on your Martial Arts
        skill and Wisdom.
Base power: 10% of Martial Arts skill.
Cooldown: Cannot be reused until 5 turns have passed.
Extra points: +10% of Martial Arts skill to power.

This ability allows you to restore your hp. The amount restored uses the
spell power formula, and is based on Wisdom. The biggest advantage to this
ability compared to normal healing spells is that you can use it as a
combat feat, and therefore you don't have to interrupt your attacks to
restore your hp. With enough Martial Arts skill, it can become a very
potent healing ability.

6. Spiritual Warrior(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases the damages of unarmed melee attacks and wisdom-casted
        spells.
Bonus to unarmed melee attacks and Wisdom casted spells damages: +10%
Extra points: +10% to damages bonus.

This passive ability increases the damages of both unarmed melee attacks
and wisdom-casted spells. This allows you to be effective at both, giving
you both power and versatility on how to deal with your foes.

7. Body & Mind Synchronization(Active/Passive, level 6)

Effect: When you perform a successful unarmed melee attack on a target,
        you have a chance to cast a spell using your Wisdom.
Resist: (Wisdom + Martial Arts) vs (Mind + Magic Defense)
Extra points: +10% to resist roll.

With this ability, whenever you successfully perform an unarmed melee attack
on a monster, you will have a chance to cast a spell during that same action.
You will use wisdom spellcasting to cast the spell, and you are restricted to
spells that you can cast without any chances of failure(in other words,
spells that have a cost equal or lower than your wisdom). With a lot of
extra attacks per rounds, you'll be able to cast many spells this way, and
this will give you a lot of options during combat.

Note that you cannot cast healing spells through this ability.

8. Paralyzing Strike(Active, level 6, combat feat)

Effect: An unarmed strike that may paralyze.
Damages: Base unarmed damages + 10%.
Element: Based on gloves.
Duration: 3 turns.
Resist: (Strength + Wisdom + Martial Arts) vs (Strength + AC)
Extra points: +10% to damages.
              +10% to resist roll.

This ability allows you to perform an attack that has a chance to paralyze.
This can be useful to stop an enemy during a few turns, allowing you to go
all out and hit it without any retaliation. This ability will not paralyze
enemies immune to paralysis, but will still deal more damage than a regular
attack.

9. Ki Resilience(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Inner energy makes your body more resistant to all attacks. Improves
        AC and magic damages mitigation based on your Wisdom.
Bonus to AC: 10% of Wisdom.
Bonus to Magic Defense for magic damages mitigation: 10% of Wisdom.
Extra points: +10% of Wisdom to bonus.

This passive ability uses your Wisdom to improve your defenses by raising
AC and adding to Magic Defense for the purpose of magic damages mitigation.
The bonus is based on your total wisdom, so if you combine this with gear
that gives bonus to Wisdom, it can give a significant protection against
damages.

Note that the bonus to AC is applied after all other bonus. This means that
neither the Defense skill, nor to_ac bonus from items will affect the bonus
provided by this ability. As for the bonus to Magic Defense, it only applies
to magic damages mitigation, it doesn't help you dodging spells.

10. Perfect Union(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Your body and mind are perfectly united, allowing you to gain great
        strength, speed and power of the mind.
Bonus to unarmed melee damages: +10%
Bonus to speed: +1
Bonus to dodge rolls: 10% of Martial Arts skill.
Bonus to base Wisdom: +10%
Extra points: +10% to unarmed melee damages.
              +1 to speed.
              +10% of Martial Arts skill to dodge rolls.
              +10% to base Wisdom.

This ability improves several attributes: unarmed melee damages, speed, dodging
ability and base Wisdom. This means that you'll be doing more damages, you'll
be able to cast better spells and the dodge bonus will help you focus more on
Martial Arts instead of spending many points in Agility.

Note that the bonus to speed and dodge rolls are only available if you are
wearing light or no armor. It doesn't work with heavy armor.

MARKSMAN
----------

Note: 'Maximum shots' refers to the maximum number of shots you can fire in
one turn with the ability. So with six points in Power Shot, for example,
you can fire up to three Power Shots per turns. Note, however, that you
may never fire more shots than the maximum number of shots you have, and
of course, should you run out of ammos or need to reload, this will also
interrupt your attacks. Finally, if you dual wield ranged weapons, such
as using two pistols, you will get to fire with both weapons.

Unless otherwise specified, all active abilities will take the elemental
properties of your ranged weapon or ammos if the ranged weapon does regular
physical damage.

1. Power Shot(Active, level 1)

Effect: A shot that deals a lot of damage.
Damage: Base shot damage.
Maximum shots: 1
Extra points: +30% to damage.
              +1 maximum shots every 3 points.

This ability fires a shot that is more powerful than a regular shot. Though
it has no other effects, it's an excellent ability if your main concern
is dealing damage with ranged attacks.

2. Paralyzing Shot(Active, level 1)

Effect: A shot that can paralyze the target.
Damage: Base shot damage.
Maximum shots: 1
Power: 20
Paralysis duration: 3
Resist: (Dexterity + Shooting skill + Specialized shooting skill) vs
        (Strength + AC)
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +1 maximum shots every 10 points.
              +5% to resist roll.

This ability allows you to fire a shot that has a chance to paralyze the
target. If you hit your target, a test between this ability's power and
the monster's level + strength stat will be rolled. If you win, the
monster will become paralyzed for a couple of turns. Note that the
paralyzing effect will not work against enemies immune to paralysis.

3. Ricochet Shot(Active, level 1)

Effect: A shot that quickly ricochets on many targets(this is treated as a ball
        attack).
Damage: Base shot damage.
Maximum shots: 1
Radius: 2
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +1 maximum shots every 3 points.
              +1 to radius every 10 points.

This ability allows you to fire a shot that will damage multiple enemies
at once. This can be quite useful when facing large groups of enemies,
as it allows you to damage them all at once.

4. Counter Shot(Passive, level 1)

Effect: When targetted by a ranged or magic attack, immediatly fire a shot
        at the attacker.
Damage: Base shot damage.
Extra points: +20% to damage.

With this passive ability, you will be able to fire a shot back at any monsters
that would attempt to shoot at you, or cast a spell. The ability will trigger
after the attack's execution. If you want to turn off this ability, you may
do so using the 'K' command to toggle it off. Remember that it consumes ammos
and can deplete them quickly if you're facing a group of casters or ranged
attackers. By default, the ability will be off when you learn it, so make
sure you turn it on.

5. Rapid Shot(Active, level 1)

Effect: A very quick shot that is difficult to avoid. It's so fast you
        might even have time to reload your weapon in the same turn!
Damage: Base shot damage.
Bonus to_hit: +20%
Maximum shots: 3
Chance to reload: 10%
Extra points: +5% to damage.
              +20% to_hit per points.
              +3% chance to reload.
              +1 maximum shots.

Although a bit weaker in terms of raw power, Rapid Shot has the highest
firing rate out of all the ranged attack skills of the Marksman, starting at
3 maximum shots and increasing every points. The shots have high hit rate,
and there's a chance the weapon will be reloaded at every shots. If you were
to place 30 points in this ability, you would never need to reload your
weapon after using this ability.

6. Spinning Storm Shot(Active, level 1)

Effect: A shot that becomes an edged wind gust, and spins around you to
        damage enemies.
Damage: Base shot damage.
Type: Wind
Maximum shots: 1
Radius: 1
Extra points: +20% to damage.
              +1 maximum shots every 5 points.
              +1 to radius every 10 points.
              With 10 or more points, the ability will create storms.
              They deal 20% of the damage a regular Storm Shot would.

Though not a long range attack, this ability has many other uses. It can be
used as a source of elemental damage, and it can also be useful if you
find yourself surrounded by enemies. Finally, if you place at least 10
points, it will leave behind storms, which will damage enemies walking
through them. Storms deals pure magical damage, and are not treated
as ranged attacks, but magic attacks(although they are not returned by
magic returning enemies).

7. Enhance Ranged Weapon(Active, level 6)

Effect: Improve various attributes of your ranged weapons.
Extra points: See below.

This ability allows you to select one of your ranged weapons, and enhance
it. There are many types of enhancements you can apply. You'll be asked to
choose one when you use this ability. The enhancements can be applied to
any ranged weapons, even magical or crafted ones, although you can only
apply one enhancement per weapons. Note that you will not be able to sell
enhanced weapons.

Tip: If you find a levelable ranged weapon, it's better to use this ability
before starting to level it, as it will result in higher bonus.

1. General Enhancement

This type of enhancement improves many attributes of your weapon. It has
the following benefits:

+3 to_hit and to_dam bonus per points.
+1 to maximum ammo capacity for every 5 points.
+1 extra shots for every 10 points.
+5 to weapon's power per points.

2. Velocity Enhancement

A type of enhancement that focus on the weapon's fire and reload speed.
It will provide these benefits:

+1 to maximum ammo capacity for every 2 pojnts.
+1 extra shots for every 5 points.
-1 to ammo consumption for every 10 points(cannot go below 1).

3. Power Enhancement

A type of enhancement that focus on improving the weapon's power.
It will provide these benefits:

+5 to_hit and to_dam bonus per points.
+10 to weapon's power per points.
With 10 or more points, you may change the weapon's elemental damage
type to any Elemental spells you've learned. Note that you must
actually create a spell out of the element, as you'll have to choose
from your spells list, but the power or cost of the spell doesn't matter.

8. Sharpshooter(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Increases your dexterity and ranged damage.
Bonus to base dexterity: +10%
Bonus to ranged damage: +10%
Extra points: +10% to base dexterity.
              +10% to ranged damage.

This passive ability will increase your dexterity and give you a passive
bonus to ranged damage. This means that it will give you quite a
significant buff to your ranged damage, as well as making them more
accurate.

9. Piercing Shot(Active, level 6)

Effect: A shot that ignores some of the monster's resistances.
Damage: Base shot damage.
Maximum shots: 1
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +5% resistance ignored.
              +1 maximum shots every 4 points.
              With 10 or more points, ignores '50% damage reduction' ability
              of elites and bosses.
              With 20 or more points, ignores the immunity abilities of
              elites and bosses.

This ability fires a shot that will ignore some of the target's resistances
at a rate of 5% per points. So with 20 points in this ability, you wouldn't
have to worry about resistances ever again. While there are many ways to
get elemental damage on your weapons and ammos, this provides a reliable
ability that can be used with any weapons. At 10 and 20 points, it also
ignores some abilities of elite and boss monsters.

10. Accurate Shots(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Gives all shots a chance to never miss, as well as increased damage
        and accuracy.
Bonus to ranged damage: +10%
Bonus to ranged hit rolls: +10%
Resist: (Dexterity + Shooting + Specialized ranged skill) vs
        (Dexterity + Evasion)
Extra points: +10% to ranged damage.
              +10% to ranged hit rolls.
              +5% to resist roll.

This passive ability gives all your shots a chance to land a guaranteed hit
that will ignore the defense and any counters the monster may have. But even
if the roll fails, the regular hit roll will take place with increased
accuracy. The ability also provides an increase to damage, making this
ability very powerful.

BARD
------

1. Improved Songs(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improves the power of offensive and healing songs, and also increases
        their area of effect.
Offensive/Healing songs power: +10%
Extra points: +10% to Offensive/Healing songs power.
              +1 to song radius every 5 points.

This passive ability gives you a bonus to the power of all offensive and
healing songs that you use, and will also increase their area of effect.
By placing points in this ability, you can quickly gain a good area of effect
for your songs, without having to use a Rhythm that costs a lot of Charisma
to add to your song. Or you can combine this with a costly Rhythm to get
a very large area of effect.

2. Inspire Courage(Active/Passive, level 1)

Effect: Activate this ability to motivate friendly monsters and increase all
        their skills. This ability also provides a passive bonus to your
        Fighting, Shooting, Spellcraft and Music skills, as well as your
        Charisma.
Radius: 10
Bonus to all monster skills: (10% of Charisma)%
Summons duration: +3 turns.
Bonus to Fighting, Shooting, Spellcraft and Music: 3% of Charisma.
Bonus to Charisma: +5% of base Charisma.
Extra points: +(10% of Charisma)% to all affected monster skills.
              +3 to summons duration.
              +3% of Charisma to Fighting, Shooting and Spellcraft.
              +5% of base Charisma to Charisma.

You can activate this ability to inspire friendly monsters around you, and give
them a bonus to all their skills. The more points you place in this ability,
and the higher your Charisma, the greater the bonus will be. Summoned friendly
monsters will also be able to stay with you for a longer time. Any monster
affected by this ability will receive the "Morale Boost" status, meaning they
have been affected by this ability, and will not be able to be affected again.

Also, this ability will give you a passive bonus to Fighting, Shooting and
Spellcraft that is always active, and based on your Charisma. Charisma itself
will be buffed by this ability, so with enough points, you can gain a
considerable bonus to all three general combat skills.

3. Lore of the Bard(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Gain a bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma, based on your
        base Charisma.
Bonus to Intelligence/Wisdom/Charisma: 10% of base Charisma.
Extra points: +10% of base Charisma to Intelligence/Wisdom/Charisma.

This passive ability gives you a bonus to three stats, Intelligence, Wisdom
and Charisma, all based on your base Charisma. This means that points placed
in Charisma upon leveling up will not only make you better with Music, but
also with Intelligence and Wisdom-based spellcasting.

4. Stunning Note(Active, level 1)

Effect: An attack that deals Sound damage, and has a chance to paralyze
        enemies. Requires a musical instrument.
Damage: Based on intrument.
Type: Sound
Radius: 2
Paralysis duration: 2 turns
Resist: 10% of (Charisma + Music) vs (Mind + Magic Defense)
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +10% of (Charisma + Music) to roll, up to a maximum of 100% at
               10 points.
              +5% to resist roll.
              +1 to radius every 10 points.

The damage of this ability uses the standard music damage formula(based on
Charisma, and uses Music skill to bypass enemies defenses), but it is only
based on the damage of the musical instrument you are using, and not the
song you are singing. However, with a powerful instrument, and multiple
points in this ability, it could eventually catch up, or even surpass
normal song damage, thanks to it's damage bonus being applied to the
damage after the passive bonus have been applied.

The other function of this ability is to stun multiple enemies. Stunned
enemies won't perform any action, allowing you to perform another action
for free without fear of counter attack. Early on, enemies have little to
no Magic Defense, and this ability will work very often. If you plan on using
it against strong enemies, however, you will need to place multiple points
in it, and have high Charisma and Music skill. Note that the paralysis
effect doesn't work on enemies immune to paralysis, and it will also not
work on enemies that are immune to Sound.

5. Sotto Voce(Active, level 1)

Effect: Teleport all friendly monsters around you, or teleport enemies away.
Maximum distance(friends teleport): 20
Maximum distance(enemies teleport): 10
Enemies teleport radius: 100
Resist: (Charisma + Music) vs (Mind + Magic Defense)
Extra points: +20 to maximum distance for teleporting friendly monsters.
              +10% to resist roll.

This ability has two possible effects(you can choose which effect you
want when you use this ability). The first one is to teleport friendly
monsters present on the current dungeon level, wherever they may be, next
to you. This is useful if you have to teleport away and friendly monsters
are still fighting away from you. This effect does not take any turns,
and can be performed as a free action.

The second effect is that it will teleport enemies that are near you
away from you. Each enemies is allowed a resistance roll to resist this
effect, but if they fail, they will be teleported. Note that they are
still present on the dungeon level, and so they aren't dead, and you
could still encounter them later on.

This ability can only be used in dungeons, it cannot be used outside or
in quest/indoor areas.

6. Charismatic Musician(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improves your Charisma and Music skill, and give a passive bonus
        to the damage of your offensive songs.
Bonus to Charisma: 5% of base Charisma.
Bonus to Music: 10% of base Music skill.
Bonus to songs damage: +10%
Extra points: +5% of base Charisma to Charisma.
              +10% of base Music skill to Music.
              +10% to songs damage.

This passive ability gives you a bonus to Charisma, Music and also a passive
damage bonus to all offensive songs. Because it raises all stats related
to Music, it will make all your songs perform better.

7. Bardic Reputation(Passive, level 6)

Effect: You become a famed adventurer and artist. This affects how the world
        interacts with you(see below), and also gives you a bonus to your
        Charisma.
- Your Charisma is treated 20% higher for every points for the purpose of
  unlocking dialogue options.
- Your Charisma is treated 20% higher for every points for the purpose of
  getting discounts in stores.

Bonus to Charisma: +10% of base Charisma.
Extra points: +10% of base Charisma to Charisma.
              See above for other improvements.

This passive ability gives you a bonus to Charisma, and also makes Charisma
more effective for the purpose of unlocking dialogue options in certain
situations, and for the purpose of reducing prices in stores. With points
in this ability, you will be able to buy your equipment faster, get better
choices in certain dialogues, and higher Charisma will make you better
with Music and other Charisma-related abilities.

8. Effect Songs Mastery(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Increases the power of "effect" songs that applies to yourself.
Bonus to effect songs: +20%
Bonus to healing songs: +10%
Extra points: +20% to power of effect songs.
              +10% to power of healing songs.

This passive ability raises the power of effect songs that applies to yourself.
This includes healing songs, and other songs that buff stats, or have any other
effect on you. If you use the melodies "Healing Melody", "Song of Strength" or
other similar melodies, consider placing some points in this ability to make
them more effective.

Note that healing songs works a bit differently, as the effect is treated
as a passive bonus to healing effects rather than a direct boost to the power
of the song. This means that it will only increase the healing effect on
yourself.

9. Enthralling Songs(Passive, level 6)

Effect: All offensive songs gain the potential to turn enemies into allies.
Resist: 10% of (Charisma + Music skill) vs ((Mind + Magic Defense) * CR)
Extra points: +10% of (Charisma + Music skill), up to a maximum of 100% at
               10 points.
              +5% to resist roll.

This passive ability will give all your offensive songs the power to enthrall
enemies and make them allies. If successful, the affected enemies will remain
allies for as long as you remain on the current area that you're exploring.
Note that Uniques and certain other enemies may not be possible to enthrall.

Be aware that enemies of higher CR are significantly harder to enthrall.
In addition to their naturally superior stats, their resistance roll is
multiplied by their CR, making them even more difficult to charm.

To enable this effect, you will first have to turn it on in the 'K' menu.
After that, you can turn it off by going in the 'K' menu again.

10. Bardic Grandeur(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Your performance is so majestic that enemies may become fascinated
        by your presence, and lose their turn. Also gives you a bonus
        to Charisma.
Bonus to Charisma: +10% of base Charisma.
Resist: 10% of (Charisma + Music skill) vs ((Mind + Magic Defense) * CR)
Extra points: +10% of (Charisma + Music skill), up to a maximum of 100% at
               10 points.
              +5% to resist roll.
              +10% of base Charisma to Charisma.

Enemies that are in your line of sight will have to win a resistance roll.
If they don't, they will become fascinated by your performance, and lose
their turn. The ability will also give you a bonus to Charisma, raising
both this ability's success rate, and improving Music and many other
abilities.

ELEMENTAL LORD
----------------

Chosen Element: When changing class to Elemental Lord for the first time, you
                will be asked to choose which element you want to specialize
                into. This choice is permanent and cannot be changed through
                normal means, so choose wisely! Many of the Elemental Lord's
                abilities will empower attacks of your chosen element.

                NOTE: Zulgors will always have "Chaos" as their chosen element.


1. Elemental Spellsword(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Your base Strength gives a bonus to Intelligence and vice versa. Also
        gives you a passive bonus to damage for attacks of your chosen element,
        and allows you to use the Elemental skill for melee attacks of your
        chosen element.
Bonus to Strength: 20% of base Intelligence.
Bonus to Intelligence: 20% of base Strength.
Bonus to damage of chosen element: +30%
Percent of Elemental skill added to melee attacks of chosen element: 10%
Extra points: +20% of base Intelligence to Strength.
              +20% of base Strength to Intelligence.
              +30% to damage of chosen element.
              +10% of Elemental skill added to melee attacks of chosen element.
              (up to a maximum of 100% at 10 points)

This passive ability does a lot of things. First, it will give you a bonus
to Strength and Intelligence, depending on which stat your raised. Points
placed in Strength will increase your Intelligence, and points in Intelligence
will increase your Strength. Note that this is based on your base stats, so
this does not apply to bonus from items.

Secondly, it will give you a passive bonus to all damage done by your chosen
element. This applies to all forms of attacks, melee, ranged and magic.
Although it only applies to attacks from a single element, the bonus is greater
than many other passive bonus, so it's definitely worth it.

Lastly, whenever you make a melee attack with the same attack type as your
chosen element, it will allow you to add your Elemental skill to your Fighting
skill or specialized weapon skill. Since the Elemental skill is a specialized
skill, this ability treats it as if it was a specialized weapon skill(meaning
you get 150% of the skill added to your other weapon skills). By placing
10 points in this ability, 100% of your Elemental skills will count as a
specialized weapon skill, making it possible to entirely rely on this skill
to do melee fighting, and not having to spend any skill points on normal
weapon skills.

2. Resistance Piercing(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Your melee and magic attacks ignores some of the enemy's resistance
        to your chosen element, based on either Strength for melee attacks,
        or Intelligence for magic attacks.
Power(melee): Strength + Elemental skill.
Power(magic): Intelligence + Elemental skill.
Enemy power: (Strength + Magic Defense)
Extra points: +20% to powers.

This makes melee and magic of your chosen element ignore a percentage of the
enemy's resistance to your chosen element. How much is ignored depends on
the ability's power(which uses either Strength or Intelligence depending
if it's a melee or magic attack) versus the monster's Strength and Magic
Defense skill.

Let's assume you make a melee attack against a monster with 100% resistance,
normally immune to your attacks. Your Strength is 50 and your Elemental skill
is 100. This gives you a power of 150. With 5 points in this ability, this
would be raised to 300. You're up against a monster with 200 Strength and
200 Magic Defense, so a total power of 400.

The two powers are compared. On a total of 700, your 300 represents roughly 42%
of that amount. Therefore, 42% of the monster's resistance will be ignored,
meaning the monster will have 58% resistance as opposed to 100%.

If you chose Poison as your chosen element, and also have points in
Art of Poisoning, the modifiers from both abilities will be added together.
So using the example above, if you had 10 points in Art of Poisoning, you'd
ignore an additional 30 points of resistance, and you'd ignore a total of
72% of the monster's resistance. Note that resistances still won't go below 0.

3. Elemental Strike(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: A powerful melee attack that has the same elemental attribute as
        your chosen element.
Damage: Normal melee damage + 30%.
Type: Chosen element.
Extra points: +30% to damage.

This is a very powerful melee attack that will always have the same elemental
type as your chosen element, no matter what weapon you are using. It's power
is very high for a combat feat, and although it has no special effects, it
makes up for it in pure power.

4. Elemental Armor(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Become highly resistant to your chosen element, and gain damage
        reduction against all Elemental attacks. In addition, monsters that
        uses melee attacks against you will take some magic damage.
Resistance to chosen element: +20%
Elemental damage reduction: Based on Elemental skill.
Base magic damage to melee attackers: 3
Damage type: Chosen element.
Extra points: +20% resistance to chosen element(up to a maximum of 100%).
              +10% to resistance's power(see below for more explanations).
              +3 to base magic damage to melee attackers.

This passive ability will quickly make you immune to your chosen element
with only a few points placed in. This can be especially useful if you
chose an element that you know a lot of enemies uses frequently.

In addition, you will damage reduction against all Elemental attacks used
on you. Elemental attacks refers to most damage types available in the Elemental
school of magic, except Physical. It also includes some dual elements, such
as Ice or Grey, but does not include Alteration and Mysticism effects,
such as Life Blast or Harm.

The way it works is that half your Elemental skill is compared to the monster's
stats and skills. Which stat and skill depends on the attack you've received
(strength and melee skill for melee attacks, dexterity and ranged skilled
for ranged and mind and magic skill for magic). To explain, let's assume
an Elemental skill of 100, versus a melee attack of a monster that has 100
strength and 100 melee skill. With 5 points in this ability, your effective
power would be 75. The monster has 200. The total power involved is now 275.
So the percentage of reduction you get is what 75 represents out of 275,
which is roughly 27%, so you'd get 27% damage reduction against all Elemental
attacks. This reduction is applied before any reduction from armor or
Magic Defense.

Lastly, this ability will deal magic damage to enemies that attacks you.
The damage uses the normal spells damage formula and uses your Intelligence.
This damage can be resisted by Magic Defense, so make sure your Elemental
skill is high enough to avoid this problem.

5. Elemental Mana Burn(Active, level 1)

Effect: Target an enemy that resists your chosen element for a chance of
        reducing the target's mana to 0.
Resist: 10% of (Intelligence + Elemental skill) vs (Mind + Magic Defense skill)
Extra points: +10% of (Intelligence + Elemental skill), up to a maximum of 100%
              at 5 points.
              +10% to rolls.

This ability allows you to target an enemy that is in your line of sight for a
chance of reducing it's mana to 0. The target must be a creature that belongs
to your chosen element, which is determined by it's resistance to that element.
Enemies with less than 100% resistance to your chosen element are more resistant
to this ability, and the close they are to 0, the more resistant they get, with
enemies having no resistance to your element being immune to this ability.

Having their mana reduced to 0 will permanently prevent the affected enemies
from casting spells or abilities that requires mana. This can turn a difficult
enemy into a relatively easy fight if you are successful in using this ability.
Some monsters have abilities that costs no mana to use, but most standard
magic attacks and summoning spells have a mana cost.

If you plan on using this ability, try to choose an element that is resisted
often, to give you more opportunities to use it.

6. Weaken Elemental Attacks(Active, level 1)

Effect: Reduce the power of all Elemental attacks done by affected enemies,
        and especially your chosen element.
Elemental damage reduction: Based on Elemental skill.
Resist: (Intelligence + Elemental skill) vs (Mind + Magic Defense)
Radius: 2
Extra points: +10% to Elemental skill for calculating damage reduction.
              +10% to resist rolls.
              +1 to radius every 5 points.

This ability can weaken the Elemental attacks of affected enemies. If the
ability is successful, all the attacks done by affected monsters that
deals Elemental damage will be reduced by a percentile amount that is the
result of a comparison between your Elemental skill and the monster's skill
(which one depends on the type of attack that is used). Elemental damage
refers to the damage types in the Elemental school of magic, except Physical,
and also includes certain dual elements, such as Ice or Grey. In addition to
the normal damage reduction provided by this ability, Elemental attacks of
your chosen element will be further halved.

Since this ability uses a very similar formula to Elemental Armor for
calculating the percentile reduction, it is a very good idea to combine both
abilities, so that not only will you become more resistant to attacks, enemies
will deal less damage as well.

7. Elemental Wave(Active, level 6)

Effect: Cast an elemental chain attack at enemies that is based on your
        melee damage, and deals magic elemental damage.
Magic Damage: Normal melee damage + 10%. (requires an equipped weapon)
Type: Chosen element.
Range: 30
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +1 to radius every 10 points.

This will cast an elemental chain attack that will pierce through multiple
enemies, and possibly hit each of them more than one if you place enough
points to gain an area of effect with this attack.

An important thing to remember is that although the damage are based on
your melee damage, it is treated as a magic attack, and therefore will require
Spellcraft or Elemental skill to overcome Magic Defense, as if it was a regular
magic attack. Also be careful about passive abilities that improves melee
damage, they might not work with this since it's a magic attack. Of course,
magic-empowering abilities may work(but consider that this
isn't considered "spellcasting", but a regular magic attack), as does spell
damage bonus found on certain items such as rods and staves.

8. Exploding Strike(Active, level 6, combat feat)

Effect: A melee attack that causes an elemental explosion on the target.
Damage: Normal melee damage + 10%.
Type: Chosen element.
Radius: 2
Extra points: +10% to damage.
              +1 to radius every 10 points.

This ability allows you to perform a melee attack that deals damage over an
area of effect, thus damaging multiple enemies at once. While not as powerful
as Elemental Strike, this is much better for defeating groups of enemies,
especially if you have a very high Combat Feats skill to use this ability
multiple times per turns.

9. Drain Elemental Being(Active, level 6)

Effect: Target a monster that resists your chosen element to lower all stats,
        skills and ac by a certain amount. You will temporarely gain the drained
        amount of Strength, Dexterity and Mind to the respective stat(Mind
        goes to Intelligence).
Stats/skills/ac reduction: 25%
Stats boost duration: 5
Resist: 10% of (Intelligence + Elemental skill) vs (Mind + Magic Defense)
Extra points: +10% of (Intelligence + Elemental skill) to resist roll, up to
              a maximum of 100% at 10 points.
              +10% to resist roll.
              +1% to stats/skills reduction for every 5 points.
              +1 to stats boost duration.

This ability allows you to target an enemy, and reduce all it's stats,
skills and ac, making it weaker at everything it does, take more damage, etc...
The amount of Strength, Dexterity and Mind that it lost will be temporarely
added to your own Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. If you use this
on a powerful enemy, not only will you weaken it, but you will become very
powerful for a short amount of time.

Repeated uses of this ability on the same enemy will result in the attributes
being lowered further. The percentile reduction applies to the new amount after
the initial reduction. This means that the temporary Strength, Dexterity
and Intelligence that you will gain from a second use of this ability will be
less than the first time, and it will override the original bonus with the
new ones.

Note that this will only work on monsters that have resistance to your chosen
element. If they have less than 100% resistance, this ability will be less
effective. It will not work on enemies with no resistance to your chosen
element.

10. Elemental Being(Passive, level 10)

Effect: You become an elemental being of your chosen element. You will become
        immune to your chosen element, and gain various powers.

Resistance to chosen element: 100

Elemental Aura:
                Gain an elemental aura that damages enemies around you every
                turns. (will not hurt friendly creatures)
                Base magic damage: 4/points. (Intelligence-based)
                Type: Chosen element.
                Radius: 2

Elemental Attacks:
                All attacks you do will deal additional magic damage to
                the target. Works with any types of abilities that uses a
                projection, even if they don't deal damage. The only exceptions
                are the attacks provided by this ability(in other words, the
                Elemental Aura, and this Elemental Attacks effect), and brands
                on weapons.
                Base magic damage: 2/points. (Intelligence-based)
                Type: Chosen element.

Passive bonus to Strength, Intelligence and Constitution: +5%/points.
                                                          (based on base stats)
Passive bonus to Elemental skill: +5%/points. (based on base skill)
Passive bonus to mana: +2%/points.
Passive bonus to all damage of your chosen element: +30%/points.
Physical resistance: +2%/points, up to a maximum of +75%.
                    (your body becomes more of your chosen element, and less
                     physical matter.)

Extra points: See above for the list of abilities and how they are improved.
              With 10 or more points, the graphic representing your character
              will change color. The color depends on your chosen element.

This powerful ability will turn you into a pure elemental being, and you will
become very powerful in many ways. You gain an Elemental Aura, all your attacks
deals additional damage, you gain bonus to all stats, Elemental skill, mana,
all damage of your chosen element and even Physical resistance.

The aura can be turned on or off using the "K" command. It is off by default.

With 10 or more points, your graphic's color will change to mark your status
as a powerful elemental being!

DEFENDER
----------

Mighty Defense: The Defender has access to several "Mighty Defense" abilities.
They provide great defenses against a specific type of attacks. Mighty Defenses,
once activated, will always provide their protective effect on the next
attack of the type they provide protection against. After defending against
the attack, there will be a roll between your Constitution + Defense skill +
Magic Defense vs the monster's stat and skill, which depends on what type of
attack was used. If you win the roll, the Mighty Defense is preserved and will
be able to defend against the next attack of that type. If you fail, it breaks,
and will have to be activated again.

If you are wearing hard/dragon armor, it's base AC will be added to the roll.
If you are using a shield, the roll will be increased by a percentage equal
to the shield's base AC. Both bonus applies before the percentile bonus given
by the ability's level, so though not mandatory, wearing hard/dragon armor and
using a shield is recommended.

Also note that Magic Defense is always added to the roll, even against
non-magical attacks. Finally, you can only have one Mighty Defense ability
active at a time.


1. Heavy Armor Mastery(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Makes hard armors and dragon armors more effective by having them
        provide more AC. Also increases HP while wearing hard or dragon
        armor.
Bonus to provided hard/dragon armor AC: +3%
Bonus to HP while wearing hard/dragon armor:
                  (1% of hard/dragon armor's AC)% to HP.
Extra points: +3% to provided hard/dragon armor.
              +(1% of hard/dragon armor's AC)% to HP.
              With 5 or more points, half of your AC is added to Magic Defense
              for the purpose of mitigating magic damages when wearing hard or
              dragon armors. Does not affect the chance to avoid spells,
              however.

This ability makes hard/dragon armors more effective, and with only 5 points,
you get the benefit of being able to add half your AC to your Magic Defense for
the purpose of mitigating magic damage. Although 3% may not seem like much,
remember that this affects the provided AC of your armor. So let's say you
wear an armor with a base AC of 100. With 10 points in this ability, your
armor's base AC will be treated as 130. It will then be increased by your
Defense skill and your to_a bonus, making the bonus quite significant.
This is in addition to the extra HP you're going to get, which helps with
all types of damage.

2. Shield Mastery(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases your chance to block with a shield. Your shield will also
        provide more AC.
Bonus to blocking rolls: +15%
Bonus to provided shield AC: +3%
Extra points: +15% to blocking rolls.
              +3% to provided shield AC.
              With 5 or more points, you will get a chance to block incoming
              magic attacks, using your usual block roll.

This passive ability will give you a better chance to block incoming attacks
with your shield, as well as giving a slight bonus to your AC. With 5 or more
points, however, you will now be able to use your shield to block magic attacks,
making the ability much more powerful and useful.

3. Mighty Defense, Melee(Active, level 1)

Effect: While this ability is active, reduce all melee damage you take by 80%.
Extra points: +20% to resist roll.
              With 5 or more points, the ability no longer takes any turn
              to activate.

This is the Mighty Defense against melee attacks. It works against all attacks
treated as melee, regardless of the elemental attribute they use. Very useful
if you fight in melee combat a lot, or when facing a monster with powerful
melee attacks. If you dodge a melee attack, this ability will not apply,
and will have no chance of breaking.

4. Mighty Defense, Ranged(Active, level 1)

Effect: While this ability is active, reduce all ranged damage you take by 80%.
Extra points: +20% to resist roll.
              With 5 or more points, the ability no longer takes any turn
              to activate.

This is the Mighty Defense against ranged attacks. Ranged attacks are attacks
like arrows, bolts and other things monsters can shoot at you, using their
Dexterity and Ranged Skill. It does not include magic spells, which are treated
as magic attacks. If you tend to keep your distance from enemies, yet have a
low AC, this ability can be very useful, as ranged attacks might be otherwise
very dangerous. If you dodge a ranged attack, this ability will not apply,
and will have no chance of breaking.

5. Mighty Defense, Magic(Active, level 1)

Effect: While this ability is active, reduce all magic damage you take by 80%.
Extra points: +20% to resist roll.
              With 5 or more points, the ability no longer takes any turn
              to activate.

This is the Mighty Defense against magic attacks. Magic attacks are the
monster's spells and effects, which includes standard spells, but also special
effects such as elemental auras and the like. It does not, however, protect
against indirect magic damage, such elemental fields. If you stop the magic
attack, this ability will not apply and will have no chance of breaking.

6. Universal Avoidance(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improves block, dodge and magic defense rolls.
Bonus to block rolls: +10%
Bonus to dodge rolls: +10%
Bonus to magic defense rolls for stopping magic attacks: +10%
Extra points: +10% to block rolls.
              +10% to dodge rolls.
              +10% to magic defense rolls for stopping magic attacks.

This ability improves your ability to block, dodge and your magic defense
rolls for the purpose of avoiding spells, making it a useful ability if
you want to be good at avoiding all kind of attacks. If you also place
5 points in Shields Mastery, the bonus from this ability will also apply
to your chance of blocking magic attacks with your shield.

7. Interrupt(Passive, level 6)

Effect: When you are right next to an enemy and it attacks you, you have a
        a chance to interrupt a serie of consecutive attacks, shots or spells,
        and prevent any attacks beyond the first from occuring.
Resist: Defense * 2(melee/ranged attacks) or Magic Defense * 2(magic attacks)
        vs Monster's skill(depends on attacks type)
        Roll starts at 10% of your Defense/Magic Defense, and increases with
        extra points.
Extra points: +20% to resist roll.
              +10% to used Defense/Magic Defense, up to a maximum of 100% at
              10 points.

When you are right next to an enemy and it attacks you with any kind of attacks,
after each of these attacks, you have a chance to prevent any further attacks
for that turn. This ability is particularly useful when facing high level
enemies with multiple attacks per turns, as interrupting their attacks prevents
a lot of potential damage you could otherwise take. May also make a great
crowd control ability. After all, if you are surrounded by eight enemies with
10 attacks each, having the potential to reduce 80 attacks to potentially
8 attacks sure sounds good!

8. Mighty Defense, Summons(Active, level 6)

Effect: While this ability is active, all damage from any attacks made by
        a summoned creature will be reduced by 80%. Also, if you are right
        next to an enemy that casts a summoning spell, you will counter
        that spell.
Extra points: +20% to resist roll.
              With 5 or more points, the ability no longer takes any turn
              to activate.

This Mighty Defense ability deals with summoned creatures, and also the
summoners themselves. Note that when countering a summoning spell, a resist
roll for breaking this ability will still occur, based on the monster's
mind stats and magic skill. Like the other Mighty Defense abilities, if
you block or otherwise avoid the attacks of summoned monsters, this ability
will not break.

9. Ultra Defenses(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Increases your Defense, Magic Defense and Constitution, based
        on their base values.
Bonus to Defense, Magic Defense and Constitution: +15%(based on base values)
Extra points: +15% to bonus.

This passive ability increases your Defense, Magic Defense and Constitution,
based on their base values. This will allow you to mitigate even more damage,
and give you more hp thanks to higher constitution, and make the Mighty Defenses
more effective.

10. Great Guard(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Whenever you are about to take damage from any attacks, you may activate
        this ability to completely negate all damage for the rest of the turn.
        The more you use it, however, the higher the chance to fail. The chance
        is reset when entering a new dungeon level, or a quest level.
Base chance to work: 100%
Extra points: +10% to chance to work.

When you are about to take damage, you may activate this ability to prevent
all damage from all attacks for the rest of the turn. After that, the chance
to work will be halved. So with one point in this ability, you will have 100%
chance to prevent damage for a turn, but the next time you use it, it will only
have a 50% chance of working. If you succeed in activating it again, then the
chance will be 25%, and so on.

When the chance gets lower than 10%, you can no longer use this ability until
the chance resets when entering a new level.

Putting extra points in this ability makes the base chance go beyond 100.
So with 10 points, you will be at 190% chance. Meaning that if you use it once,
then the chance will drop to 95%. Putting more points in this ability allow you
to use it more often, more reliably.

Note that if you fail to activate it, the chance will not go down.

MONSTERS
----------

1. Greater Evolution(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases your strength, dexterity, intelligence and wisdom by
        (chosen monster's depth)%.
Extra points: +(chosen monster's depth)% to stats.

This passive ability increases your main offensive base stats by an amount
based on the depth level of the monster you're playing. The more powerful
your monster is, the higher the bonus will be. If you want to aim for high
base stats, consider placing points in this ability, especially if your
monster kind has powerful evolutions.

2. Small but Deadly(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases your strength, dexterity, intelligence and wisdom by
        1% + 1% for every experience levels above your monster's depth.
Extra points: +1 multiplier to bonus.

This passive ability increases your main offensive base stats by an amount
based on how much higher your level is compared to your monster's depth.
The opposite of Greater Evolution, this ability is meant for players who
plays with weaker monster kinds, or prefer to stick to a lower monster
for personnal preference or because that particular monster has a particular
attack that is part of the player's strategy. With this, even a lower
monster can still get high stats later on.

3. Improved Magics(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases damages and success rate of your spells.
Bonus: +10% to offensive and healing spells damages/power.
       +10% to spell's resistance rolls(if any).
       +10% to stats boosters power.
       +1 to maximum summoning depth for summoning spells.
Extra points: +10% to spells damages.
              +10% to resistance rolls(if any).
              +10% to stats boost power.
              +1 to maximum summoning depth for summoning spells.

This passive ability increases the damages of all your monster's spells.
While you can invest your ability points in a specific spell for twice
the effect, if the monster you're playing has several diverse spells,
then this ability might be a worthy option because it will improve all
of them as opposed to just one. Also, if your spell needs to win a
resistance roll to work(such as status ailment spells), it will improve
the success rate of these spells.

4. Inner Elemental Mastery(Active/Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases damages of a chosen element by 10% of your resistance to it.
        Can also be activated for a "Piercing Spells" effect.
Damages bonus: +(20% of resistance)% to specific element damages.
Resist(piercing effect): (Int + Wis + Spellcraft) vs (Mind + Magic Defense)
Extra points: +(20% of resistance)% to specific element damages.
              +10% to resist roll.

When you increase this ability for the first time, you will be asked to
choose between 12 of the 16 main elements, and you might also get some other
choices if your monster has a specific resistance to something else. Once you
choose the element, this ability will increase the damages of any attacks
of the chosen element by 10% of your resistance to it. This ability is
obsiously meant for monsters with natural immunities, of which many have,
but you can still benefit from it even if you don't have one by equipping
essences or items that gives you resistances.

5. Improved Activation(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Improves the effects of offensive/healing item and essence activations.
Activation's power bonus: +50%
Extra points: +50% to activation power.

This ability is identical to the Mage's version. It improves the power of
your item activations, but may be even more useful to the Monster race, since
you can also activate Essences.

6. Improved Defense(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increases your base AC based on your monster's base AC.
Flat bonus to natural base AC: +5
Bonus to natural base AC: +25%
Extra points: +5 flat bonus to base AC.
              +25% to base AC.

This passive ability will significantly improve your AC. As a monster, your AC
will gradually increase with your level, but you will find that it is quite
low overall. With this ability, however, you will be able to increase it a lot.
The flat bonus is applied first, followed by the percentile bonus.

This bonus improves your 'Natural' base AC, meaning that it does not improve
the bonus you might receive from armor or Martial Arts skill. They are
calculated separately. However, once they are added up, everything will be
enhanced by your Defense skill and to_a bonus.

This ability will be particularly useful if you play a monster with a high
AC modifier, such as a golem. However, you will find it significantly weaker
if you use it with a 'caster' type monster, which tends to have lower AC.

7. Improved Counters(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Improves your chance of blocking with blocking counters, and improves
        damages of returning counters.
Bonus to block rolls: +10%
Bonos to returned damages: +20%
Extra points: +10% to block rolls.
              +20% to returned damages.

This passive ability makes your chosen monster's special counters more
effective. Many monsters have the ability to block or even reflect an
incoming attack, and if you have such an ability, this will improve it. Note
that in some cases, there may not be a blocking test and it's just a static
percentile chance to block the attack. In this case, this ability has
no effects on it.

8. Improved Passive Powers(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Improves special passive abilities your monster may have.
Extra points: Improves powers further.

Some monsters have special passive powers unique to them. If they do,
this ability will make them more powerful in various ways(increased damages,
success rate, healing, etc...), based on the nature of the power.

Note that by default, some of these powers are off.
Use the 'K' command to toggle them On and Off.

9. Racial Champion(Active/Passive, level 6)

Effect: Increases your charisma. Can also be activated to rally monsters of
        the same kind to your cause.
Charisma bonus: +(monster's depth)%.
Activated Effect's Power: 40
Radius: 3
Resist: (Charisma + Leadership + Int + Wis) vs ((Mind + Magic Defense) * CR)
Extra points: +20% to success rate.
              +1 to radius every 20 points.

This ability has two effects. The first one is a passive bonus to your
Charisma, which can be very useful if you have summoning spells. The
second one is a charm-type effect that affects monsters of the same
kind as yours(has the same letter). The power is high, though it will
not work on elites, bosses and uniques. Monsters of a different kind
will be unaffected.

Note that this ability doesn't take into account "greater" evolutions.
For example, a lesser dragon('d') cannot persuade an ancient dragon('D').

10. Paragon Elder Monster(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Become an upper class and respected monster. Improves all your
        abilities and may give you a special rank.
Bonus to all stats: 10%.
Extra points: +10% to all stats.
              At level 10 and higher, you become an Elite monster, and
              may pick a special ability. At level 20, you become a Boss
              monster, and you may pick a second ability. You may then
              pick one every 10 points, until you learn them all.

This passive ability will improve all your stats based on your base
stats. However, it's true power is to give you access to some of the
elite and boss monsters powers. Your color will also change to the elite
or boss color! Here are the abilities you can choose:

Halve Damages:
Damages you take are reduced by 50%. This apply to all forms of damages,
both physical and magical. This can be especially powerful if you play
as a monster that has a high hp and defense.

Double Weapon Damages:
Melee and ranged attacks will get +100% bonus damages. If you use a lot of
these, this ability will make them much more powerful. This works with not just
your special attacks, but any normal attacks and with any weapons or
unarmed attacks.

Note that this is additive with other passive bonus, not multiplicative.

Double Magic Damages:
Your monster's special magic attacks will get +100% bonus damages.
If you use spells a lot, this will make them stronger. This affects all magic
damages that you deal.

Note that this is additive with other passive bonus, not multiplicative.

Return Melee damages:
Enemies that attacks you in melee combat will have the attack
returned to them. Even if they miss you, they still take damages.
Note that they are still typed damages, so the monster could be
immune. The returned damages receives a multiplier for every points
in this ability.

Return Magic damages:
Enemies that cast an offensive spell at you will be returned all of
the spell's damages. Even if you avoid the spell, the spell will
still be returned, although like the melee returning ability, they
are typed damages. The returned damages receives a multiplier for
every points in this ability.


MONSTER INNATE ATTACKS AND SPELLS:

As a monster, you can also choose to place points in any of your innate
melee attacks, ranged attacks or spells. That has the following benefits:

Melee:

Most monsters have melee innate melee attacks. As a monster player, you
can use any of these moves as special attacks and even as combat feats.
Special melee attacks works with both martial arts and weapons, meaning
that both humanoid and non-humanoid monsters can fully benefit from
them. Special melee attacks will add their innate damage rolls to the
base damages of your melee attacks.

You can choose to places ability points in these attacks, and it will
have the following benefits:

- +20% to damages.
- +10% to accuracy for every points.
- The attack gains a radius of 1 every 10 points.

Note: These special attacks are treated as melee attacks for the purpose
of counters and hit rate tests. However, non-physical special attacks will
hurt elites/bosses immune to physical attacks. Of course, elemental special
attacks will not hurt magic immunes. Also, the special attacks damages
are never returned through standard returning abilities.

Ranged:

Innate ranged attacks are often used by humanoid monsters. As a result,
they can be combined with ranged weapons for maximum effectiveness.
If used without a ranged weapon, it will be treated as a magic attack,
but will use the innate attack damages and will use dex-based ranged
damages calculation. Like melee attacks, the attack's innate damages
roll will be added to the normal base ammo damages.

Note that using a special ranged attack with a ranged weapon still
consumes ammos like a normal ranged attack would. Also, the attack's
elemental type will be the one used by your attack, regardless of
shooter or ammo.

Innate ranged attacks without weapons are treated as magical attacks,
and therefore do not have hit rate test. However, you'll need
intelligence and wisdom to bypass magic counters of enemies, not
dexterity.

Placing points in these attacks have the following benefits:

Ranged weapons:
- +20% additional damages per points.
- +1 radius every 10 points.
- +10% to accuracy for every points.
- Every 3 points, you can use the attack with another of your extra
shots, if any. So if you have two extra shots in one hand, you
need 3 points in the ability to use it twice in a row. Note that
each ranged weapons is treated separately, so if you wield two
ranged weapons, and have 2 shots in each hands, 3 points in this
ability will allow you to use the ability twice in a row for each
weapons, so a total of 4 times.

Without ranged weapons:
- +20% to damages per points.
- +1 radius every 10 points.
- Is a magic attack. (uses Spellcraft, not Shooting)

Magic:

Monsters innate spells are casted using either intelligence or wisdom,
whichever is the highest, though they consume mana, so intelligence
is generally the better choice. Placing points in a specific spell
has twice the benefits of the general Improved Magics ability, with
some extras. Here's the benefits:

+20% to offensive and healing spells damages/power.
+20 to spell's power for overcoming resistance rolls(if any).
+20% to stats boosters power.
+2 to maximum summoning depth for summoning spells.
+1 extra summon for every 5 points with summoning spells.
+1 to duration of stats boosters and hasting spells.

If the monster has any unique special powers, placing points in them
will improve them in various ways, depending on the nature of that power.

Note: The Improved Magics ability and specific powers are additive in
terms of bonus. Placing one points in a specific power and one point
in Improved Magics results in a bonus of 150% to damages.


Final note: You may notice that the names of the attacks might not
always match the type of weapons you are using them with. However,
the name of the attacks do not affect the usability of the attacks
in any way, so just because the attack is named "Sword" or "Arrow"
doesn't mean you can't use it with a mace or a gun.
