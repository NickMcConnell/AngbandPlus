<font color="#00ffff">Composband FAQ

</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'd like to move one square at a time, but every time I press a key 
my character moves halfway across the screen. Help!

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You are somehow triggering the Run command instead of the Walk 
command. In addition to normal running (with the '.' command), 
Composband uses preference files to support shiftrunning (running 
by using the Shift key), which is preferred by some players. This 
mechanic sometimes leads to unwanted running, especially on the 
angband.live online server which has some very odd default settings. If 
you are playing there, see if toggling Num Lock helps you stop running, 
or else request help in the server chat.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">All right, I have a character up and walking. What should I do?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">First of all, you will want things that help your character survive 
difficult situations - either cheap healing potions (cure light/cure 
serious wounds), or escape scrolls (phase door/teleportation), or 
ideally both. These are sold at the Temple (shop </font><font color="#008040">4</font><font color="#ffffff">) and the Alchemy 
Shop (shop </font><font color="#0000ff">5</font><font color="#ffffff">). After that, you'll probably want to either explore a 
dungeon (Warrens, in Outpost, is the easiest and the usual starter 
dungeon) or request and complete one of the early quests. While the 
Thieves' Hideout quest is marked as level 5, for all but the weakest 
characters it is doable at the very beginning of the game, at least 
with a bit of luck and a cure wounds potion or two.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I access the Thieves' Hideout quest?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">In Outpost, walk to the large building just outside the city walls 
and press 'q' to request a quest from the Count. Then walk to the 
building in the northeast of the city and press '&gt;' at the quest 
entrance.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Where do I find the other quests in the game?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">All quests are offered by some building in some town, apart from the 
two (Oberon and Serpent) that you start with, and the ten random 
level-guardian quests in the Angband dungeon. Most quests have special 
entrances, which can be found in towns or their immediate vicinity. (If 
you can't spot the entrance visually, press the ']' key (or Ctrl-O) to 
display the object list; it also displays nearby entrances.) The 
entrances only appear after you request the quest.

A small number of quests are offered by towns but appear in dungeons. 
The first of these is Pest Control (offered by the Count after you've 
completed Thieves' Hideout), which is located on level 5 of the Warrens 
dungeon, or level 5 of Angband if you play in no-wilderness mode.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I keep dying! What am I doing wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Don't worry - this is an expected part of the development curve for 
new players, and even experienced roguelike veterans die a lot (with 
the possible exception of the player nicknamed "clouded"!) Learn from 
your mistakes - if a situation got you killed, avoid getting in that 
situation again, or make sure you have the supplies to keep you alive 
if something similar does happen again. Do not rely too much on items 
with a fail rate - the game is long, and if you take too many chances 
you will fail at the wrong time eventually. Try to avoid situations 
where you are one fail away from death.
   
At the same time, it is much better to have an item that saves you 97% 
of the time than to not have that item! In particular, Staffs of 
Teleport are a key helper that will often get you out of a tough spot; 
unlike scrolls of teleportation, staffs can be used while confused, 
which is often critical in the early midgame before the player acquires 
resistance to confusion.

Learn to know the monsters, develop strategies appropriate to their 
strengths and weaknesses, and avoid fights with enemies too strong for 
you.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I want to play with the strongest possible race/class combination. 
Which one is that?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">It's hard to say what the strongest class is, both because there are 
so many (with different strengths and approaches) and because some 
classes (like berserkers) are strong in the early game and not so 
strong later, while others (like psions, an extremely powerful endgame 
class) have the opposite curve. Ninjas are often used as an example of 
a strong class, and while it's very debatable whether they are the 
strongest, they do have the advantage of steady development that keeps 
them powerful through all phases of the game.

Demigods and Amberites are two of the most powerful races, but they 
also have a very steep leveling-up penalty, which can be a significant 
drawback if you want to go places fast. The "plain" human is actually a 
surprisingly powerful pick, since humans level up very fast but still 
get two demigod powers at levels 20 and 40.

At the opposite end, yeek tourists and snotling tourists are extremely 
weak combinations, used by players looking for the ultimate challenge.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">The game is offering me a stat-up. What should I invest in?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Choose a statistic your character needs; for example, on a melee 
character you'll want to improve either your strength or dexterity 
first, and constitution will also help you. If the base for one of your 
key stats is exactly 18, you'll probably want to improve that stat, 
because improvements get larger and more significant above 18. Do not 
invest too much in any one stat, though; the improvements become much 
smaller again as a statistic approaches its cap level.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">The game is offering me a demigod power. Which one should I pick?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">It depends on what your character needs; take your time to read the 
descriptions of all the powers to see which one suits you best. 
Generally, though, Unyielding and Fleet of Foot are both very strong 
options and are good "default" picks if you don't feel comfortable 
selecting something more exotic.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I have found lots of cool items, but the monsters I meet keep 
destroying them! Am I doing something wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Elemental resists help protect your inventory. With one level of 
resistance, the chances of an item being destroyed by that element are 
significantly reduced; with two levels of resistance, the item will 
only be destroyed if you're really unlucky; with three levels of 
resistance the item will be safe. Watch out for fire, acid, cold and 
electricity in the early game, and also chaos in the late game.

If you don't have the appropriate resist and don't want to risk losing 
the item, avoid monsters that might destroy it; or, if they only 
destroy items in melee, avoid melee and kill them with ranged attacks.

Note that the armor you wear will always be susceptible to damage from 
acid attacks - regardless of your acid resistance level - unless you 
have immunity to acid. This can be really annoying in the early game; 
by the late game you'll mostly wear artifacts or excellent items that 
cannot be harmed by acid.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I got bored in Outpost so I headed into the wilderness... and I'm 
still there searching endlessly down one road after another looking for 
a town.  Where are other towns and dungeons?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You need to use the global wilderness map (press the &lt; key on the 
ground level).  This gives you a scaled map of the world (often called 
the "overworld map"), where you can travel to other towns and dungeons 
more easily.  It is possible to reach any location in the game without 
using the overworld map (most roads do lead somewhere); but such an 
approach will take you much longer and also entail more risk, since 
monsters won't attack you as often if you travel through the overworld 
map.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I cannot access the overworld map. What's wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You are either playing in no-wilderness mode, which has no overworld 
map, or there is a monster nearby and the game won't let you escape too 
easily by entering the overworld. Selecting 'Beginner' (instead of 
'Normal') at character creation forces no-wilderness mode, which 
sometimes confuses players who've seen or heard about the game and 
expect a wilderness.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I want to play as an Android, Balrog, Golem, Skeleton, Zombie, 
Spectre, or Ent.  But I can't find any scrolls of satisfy hunger. And 
Berserkers no longer have racial ability of satisfy hunger. How do I 
avoid starvation?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger and the Berserker ability of Satisfy 
Hunger are obsoleted, and races which previously relied on Satisfy 
Hunger have new sources of nutrition now. Androids can quaff oil.  
Balrogs can sacrifice human corpses using the 'E'at command.  Golems, 
Skeletons, Zombies, and Spectres can absorb mana from staves and wands 
using the 'E'at command.  Ents can gain enough nutrition from potions.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm playing as a berserker, and cannot read scrolls.  How do I 
remove a curse?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You can simply 't'ake off the cursed equipment.  Since cursed items 
will attempt to stick, you may need to try the 't'ake off command more 
than once.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I know Berserkers cannot use scrolls, and rods.  How do I recall 
from dungeon?  Maybe I need to travel completely on foot!?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Berserkers gain the class power 'Recall' at level 10.  Press 'U' 
(original keyset) or 'O' (Roguelike keyset) to use class powers.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Why do Ninjas start the game with Iron Spikes?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Ninjas (and Ninja-Lawyers) can use Iron Spikes as shuriken; use the 
'v' command to throw a spike. (Other classes can also use spikes as 
throwing weapons, but will only do marginal damage; they are much more 
useful for a ninja.)


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm at normal speed (+0). But normal speed monsters sometimes 
double-move me!

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">In Composband, the amount of energy needed for a move is 
somewhat randomized (though less so than in its predecessor 
PosChengband). This method of speed system is an important feature of 
Composband and simulates real fighting. Usually a monster with the 
same speed as you will only get one move in, but always prepare for the 
possibility that they might get two moves! Don't fight when your HP is 
low unless you have a death wish.

Also, monsters don't always move at their listed speed; watch out for 
hasted monsters.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How important is my speed, anyway?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Speed is incredibly important, especially in the early game when you 
don't have much of it and it's hard to come by. A character with +10 
speed does everything twice as fast as a character with +0 speed. If 
you survive to the late game, however, you may eventually start hitting 
diminishing returns for speed; the difference between +30 speed and +40 
speed is only ten percent. Potions of Speed, and in the late game 
Staves of Speed, are extremely useful items you should ideally always 
have.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I tried to dual wield two weapons.  But I couldn't hit anything!

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You need to practice your dual wielding skill (proficiency level) 
and your weapon skills.  Hitting high level monsters many times will 
improve your skills.  Note that the information command '~' reveals 
your proficiency levels.  Some classes are very bad at dual-wielding, 
while others are much more adept at it or can become so with enough 
training. If you try to dual-wield on a sniper and it doesn't work out, 
don't let that discourage you from dual-wielding on a ninja.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do skills (proficiency levels) work?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Weapon proficiency levels and dual wielding proficiency levels 
increase your to-hit bonus.  Spell proficiency levels decrease fail 
rate and mana consumption rate of spells.  Riding proficiency level 
gives you more speed when you are riding on a high speed monster, and 
decreases risk of falling from your mount.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I increase my proficiency level?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Proficiency level of a weapon will increase when you hit a monster 
whose level is high enough compared with your character level. 
Proficiency level of a spell will increase when you cast the spell at a 
dungeon level deep enough compared with the spell level. The needed 
conditions to increase riding proficiency are rather complex; 
generally, you need to hit a monster whose level is high enough 
compared with current riding proficiency level or to shoot a monster 
while riding on a high level mount.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm a fighter type and rely largely on melee. Which weapon should I 
use?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">In the very early game, you should usually use the weapon that does 
the most damage. Press Shift+C to see the character sheet, which 
displays your melee damage and melee to-hit. You should look at both to 
determine how good a weapon is - it's no use having a weapon that 
technically does lots of damage if you can't hit anything with it! Also 
remember, though, that your to-hit percentages will improve rapidly as 
your proficiency with a weapon increases. Don't worry too much about 
starting with a -20 proficiency - unless that's your proficiency cap 
for the weapon, or if the weapon is an icky wield.

As you start finding {excellent} weapons and artifacts, you may well 
want to wield a particular weapon for the resists, bonuses or abilities 
it provides, even if you have another weapon that would do more damage. 
A dead character has no use for a high damage output.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What is an "Icky Wield"?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Some classes have a very strong preference for a certain weapon or 
type of weapon, to the extent that other weapons are marked as icky. 
The exact effects of wielding an icky weapon depend on class, but as a 
general rule you should always assume that an icky weapon will be worse 
than a non-icky one, at least from a melee perspective. In the specific 
case of Priests, however, the melee penalty is relatively small and the 
main drawback of an icky weapon is its effect on prayer fail rates.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I ride on a monster?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">At first, summon, charm or capture some suitable monster. Then use 
the pet menu command 'p'.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I use a Capture Ball?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Just equip it and activate 'A' to a dying monster.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I cannot hold a weapon and a shield without losing control of my 
horse.  My horse runs aimlessly!

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You cannot directly control your mount unless you use one hand to 
control your mount.  But you can command your mount.  Just use 'p' 
command, and give your mount a target.  The horse which was given a 
target will no longer run around aimlessly.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What is the genesis of Composband?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Composband is a fork of ComPosband, a fork of PosChengband, 
which was based on Chengband, which was based on Hengband, which was 
based on Japanese ZAngband, which was based on regular ZAngband, a fork 
of Angband, which was based on Moria and Umoria. (Whew!) In addition to 
these direct ancestors, Composband and its "family" have been 
strongly influenced by a number of other Angband variants, like 
KAngband, Posband, ToME and OAngband.
   

</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Who wrote Hengband?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Hengband is mainly based on ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version. 
ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version was developed by Mitsuhiro Itakura, 
based on both ZAngband 2.2.8 and Angband 2.8.3 Japanese version, and 
has some original features, for example, Auto-picker, in addition to 
simple translation.

Hengband also includes codes from many other variants including ToME, 
OAngband, etc.  Mr.Hoge wrote the first original part of Hengband.  And 
currently, it is maintained by Hengband Development Team including 
Mr.Hoge, Habu, Henkma, iks, Kuwa, Mogami and nsk.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">So is that why there is so much Japanese content in this game?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Yes, though it doesn't hurt that Japanese popular culture has many 
followers worldwide.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Is there a more detailed help file?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Press '?' in-game to access the online help. If you are already 
using the online help to read this file, look at the other sections, 
which offer more detailed advice.
