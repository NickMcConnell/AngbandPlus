<font color="#00ffff">FrogComposband FAQ

</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'd like to move one square at a time, but every time I press a key 
my character moves halfway across the screen. Help!

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You are somehow triggering the Run command instead of the Walk 
command. In addition to normal running (with the '.' command), 
FrogComposband uses preference files to support shiftrunning (running 
by using the Shift key), which is preferred by some players. This 
mechanic sometimes leads to unwanted running, especially on the 
angband.live online server which has some very odd default settings. If 
you are playing there, see if toggling Num Lock helps you stop running, 
turn on the online_macros option in the Input Options menu (the '=' 
key), or else request help in the server chat.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">All right, I have a character up and walking. What should I do?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">First of all, you will want things that help your character survive 
difficult situations - either cheap healing potions (cure light/cure 
serious wounds), or escape scrolls (phase door/teleportation), or 
ideally both. These are sold at the Temple (shop </font><font color="#008040">4</font><font color="#ffffff">) and the Alchemy 
Shop (shop </font><font color="#0000ff">5</font><font color="#ffffff">). After that, you'll probably want to either explore a 
dungeon (Warrens, in Outpost, is the easiest and the usual starter 
dungeon) or request and complete one of the early quests. While the 
Thieves' Hideout quest is marked as level 5, for all but the weakest 
characters it is doable at the very beginning of the game, at least 
with a bit of luck and a cure wounds potion or two.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I access the Thieves' Hideout quest?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">In Outpost, walk to the large building just outside the city walls 
and press 'q' to request a quest from the Count. Then walk to the 
building in the northeast of the city and press '&gt;' at the quest 
entrance.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Where do I find the other quests in the game?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">All quests are offered by some building in some town, apart from the 
two (Oberon and Serpent) that you start with, and the ten random 
level-guardian quests in the Angband dungeon. Most quests have special 
entrances, which can be found in towns or their immediate vicinity. (If 
you can't spot the entrance visually, press the ']' key (or Ctrl-O) to 
display the object list; it also displays nearby entrances.) The 
entrances only appear after you request the quest.

A small number of quests are offered by towns but appear in dungeons. 
The first of these is Pest Control (offered by the Count after you've 
completed Thieves' Hideout), which is located on level 5 of the Warrens 
dungeon, or level 5 of Angband in coffee-break mode and no-wilderness 
mode.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What is "coffee-break mode"? How does it differ from normal play?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Coffee-break mode is a quicker, simpler and more streamlined version 
of the game. There is no wilderness, only one town (the "Light Town" 
version of Outpost) and only one dungeon (Angband). Experience gain 
(and many forms of proficiency gain) are greatly accelerated, monster 
drops are improved, and the player receives bonus fame for reforging 
purposes. All stairs in the dungeon are two-level shafts, and forced 
descent is turned on. Small levels generate more often in the early 
part of the game, but become rarer (and less small) towards the 
endgame. Unlike normal forced-descent play, the player is allowed to 
recall back to town, as well as to skip random dungeon quests by 
recalling (although recalling out of a quest incurs a large fame 
penalty).

Coffee-break mode is a birth option; it is automatically turned on for 
players who select the 'Beginner' option at character creation, but can 
also be selected the normal way by non-beginners. Coffee-break mode is 
not an easy-mode; it is activated for beginners because it is simpler 
and allows faster progress, not because it is easy.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I can't find any up staircases, only down staircases! Is there any 
way I can get back to town?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">In coffee-break mode (and Beginner mode), up staircases never 
generate, but you can return to Outpost by reading a scroll of Word of 
Recall (or using the 'Recall' class power on a Berserker). Be careful 
not to run out of scrolls; if you start running low, buy a few more at 
the Temple or the Alchemy Shop. (If all else fails, you can hope to 
find a scroll in the dungeon.)

In pure forced-descent mode, up staircases never generate and recalling 
is disabled, so you do not have any way to return to the surface once 
you've left it.

In normal play every down staircase is matched by an up staircase, so 
you can simply walk back, though recalling is still usually faster.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I keep dying! What am I doing wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Don't worry - this is an expected part of the development curve for 
new players, and even experienced roguelike veterans die a lot (with 
the possible exception of the player nicknamed "clouded"!) Learn from 
your mistakes - if a situation got you killed, avoid getting in that 
situation again, or make sure you have the supplies to keep you alive 
if something similar does happen again. Do not rely too much on items 
with a fail rate - the game is long, and if you take too many chances 
you will fail at the wrong time eventually. Try to avoid situations 
where you are one fail away from death.
   
At the same time, it is much better to have an item that saves you 97% 
of the time than to not have that item! In particular, Staffs of 
Teleport are a key helper that will often get you out of a tough spot; 
unlike scrolls of teleportation, staffs can be used while confused, 
which is often critical in the early midgame before the player acquires 
resistance to confusion.

Learn to know the monsters, develop strategies appropriate to their 
strengths and weaknesses, and avoid fights with enemies too strong for 
you.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I want to play with the strongest possible race/class combination. 
Which one is that?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">It's hard to say what the strongest class is, both because there are 
so many (with different strengths and approaches) and because some 
classes (like berserkers) are strong in the early game and not so 
strong later, while others (like psions, an extremely powerful endgame 
class) have the opposite curve. Ninjas are often used as an example of 
a strong class, and while it's very debatable whether they are the 
strongest, they do have the advantage of steady development that keeps 
them powerful through all phases of the game. The same thing could be 
said of weaponsmiths.

Demigods and Amberites are two of the most powerful races, but they 
also have a very steep leveling-up penalty, which can be a significant 
drawback if you want to go places fast. The "plain" human is actually a 
surprisingly powerful pick, since humans level up very fast but still 
get two demigod powers at levels 20 and 40.

At the opposite end, yeek tourists and snotling tourists are extremely 
weak combinations, used by players looking for the ultimate challenge.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">The game is offering me a stat-up. What should I invest in?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Choose a statistic your character needs; for example, on a melee 
character you'll want to improve either your strength or dexterity 
first, and constitution will also help you. If the base for one of your 
key stats is exactly 18, you'll probably want to improve that stat, 
because improvements get larger and more significant above 18. Do not 
invest too much in any one stat, though; the improvements become much 
smaller again as a statistic approaches its cap level.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">The game is offering me a demigod power. Which one should I pick?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">It depends on what your character needs; take your time to read the 
descriptions of all the powers to see which one suits you best. 
Generally, though, Unyielding and Fleet of Foot are both very strong 
options and are good "default" picks if you don't feel comfortable 
selecting something more exotic.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I have found lots of cool items, but the monsters I meet keep 
destroying them! Am I doing something wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Elemental resists help protect your inventory. With one level of 
resistance, the chances of an item being destroyed by that element are 
significantly reduced; with two levels of resistance, the item will 
only be destroyed if you're really unlucky; with three levels of 
resistance the item will be safe. Watch out for fire, acid, cold and 
electricity in the early game, and also chaos in the late game. Sound 
and shards can destroy potions.

If you don't have the appropriate resist and don't want to risk losing 
the item, avoid monsters that might destroy it; or, if they only 
destroy items in melee, avoid melee and kill them with ranged attacks.

Note that the armor you wear will always be susceptible to damage from 
acid attacks - regardless of your acid resistance level - unless you 
have immunity to acid. This can be really annoying in the early game; 
by the late game you'll mostly wear artifacts or excellent items that 
cannot be harmed by acid.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I got bored in Outpost so I headed into the wilderness... and I'm 
still there searching endlessly down one road after another looking for 
a town.  Where are other towns and dungeons?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You need to use the global wilderness map (press the &lt; key on the 
ground level).  This gives you a scaled map of the world (often called 
the "overworld map"), where you can travel to other towns and dungeons 
more easily.  It is possible to reach any location in the game without 
using the overworld map (most roads do lead somewhere); but such an 
approach will take you much longer and also entail more risk, since 
monsters won't attack you as often if you travel through the overworld 
map.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I cannot access the overworld map. What's wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You are either playing in no-wilderness mode, which has no overworld 
map, or there is a monster nearby and the game won't let you escape too 
easily by entering the overworld. Coffee-break mode forces 
no-wilderness play. Selecting 'Beginner' (instead of 'Normal') at 
character creation forces coffee-break mode (and consequently 
no-wilderness play), which sometimes confuses players who've seen or 
heard about the game and expect a wilderness.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I keep getting ambushed in the wilderness! How do I survive?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Take enough Scrolls of Teleportation with you (or a Teleport staff), 
and some form of healing (like potions of cure serious wounds or cure 
critical wounds) for emergencies. Avoid high-level wilderness (like 
mountains or deep seas, or the areas around high-level dungeons) until 
you know your character can survive there. Daytime travelling is 
somewhat safer than travelling at night, as ambushes are more likely at 
night and approaching dangerous monsters are easier to spot in 
daylight. Characters with low stealth are also more likely to be 
ambushed.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I tried to reach a dungeon through the overworld, and the overworld 
map says I should be right on top of it; yet when I go to the normal 
map I can't see a dungeon entrance anywhere. What's wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Dungeon entrances in the wilderness can sometimes be tricky to 
locate because one square on the overworld map corresponds to a fairly 
large area on the normal map. First, press ] or Ctrl+O (the object list 
commands) to confirm there is indeed no entrance in sight. If the lack 
of an entrance is confirmed by the object list, explore the nearby area 
until you find the dungeon; most commonly you'll have to travel further 
in the same direction you last moved in on the overworld map. If you 
still can't find the entrance, check the overworld map to confirm you 
haven't moved out of the right area, and then try again.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I want to play as an Android, Balrog, Golem, Skeleton, Zombie, 
Spectre, or Ent.  But I can't find any scrolls of satisfy hunger. And 
Berserkers no longer have racial ability of satisfy hunger. How do I 
avoid starvation?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger and the Berserker ability of Satisfy 
Hunger are obsoleted, and races which previously relied on Satisfy 
Hunger have new sources of nutrition now. Androids can quaff oil.  
Balrogs can sacrifice human corpses using the 'E'at command.  Golems, 
Skeletons, Zombies, and Spectres can absorb mana from staves and wands 
using the 'E'at command.  Ents can gain enough nutrition from potions.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm playing as a berserker, and cannot read scrolls.  How do I 
remove a curse?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You can simply 't'ake off the cursed equipment.  Since cursed items 
will attempt to stick, you may need to try the 't'ake off command more 
than once.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I know Berserkers cannot use scrolls, and rods.  How do I recall 
from dungeon?  Maybe I need to travel completely on foot!?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Berserkers gain the class power 'Recall' at level 10.  Press 'U' 
(original keyset) or 'O' (Roguelike keyset) to use class powers.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Why do Ninjas start the game with Iron Spikes?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Ninjas (and Ninja-Lawyers) can use Iron Spikes as shuriken; use the 
'v' command to throw a spike. (Other classes can also use spikes as 
throwing weapons, but will only do marginal damage; they are much more 
useful for a ninja.)


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm at normal speed (+0). But normal speed monsters sometimes 
double-move me!

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">In FrogComposband, the amount of energy needed for a move is 
somewhat randomized (though less so than in its predecessor 
PosChengband). This method of speed system is an important feature of 
FrogComposband and simulates real fighting. Usually a monster with the 
same speed as you will only get one move in, but always prepare for the 
possibility that they might get two moves! Don't fight when your HP is 
low unless you have a death wish.

Also, monsters don't always move at their listed speed; watch out for 
hasted monsters.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How important is my speed, anyway?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Speed is incredibly important, especially in the early game when you 
don't have much of it and it's hard to come by. A character with +10 
speed does everything twice as fast as a character with +0 speed. If 
you survive to the late game, however, you may eventually start hitting 
diminishing returns for speed; the difference between +30 speed and +40 
speed is only ten percent. Potions of Speed, and in the late game 
Staves of Speed, are extremely useful items you should ideally always 
have.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I've reached the town of Anambar, and can't find a home there. Do I 
not have a home in Anambar?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Locate the Police Station and complete the quest they offer. You 
will receive a home as a reward. (However, Zul is a town where you 
really don't have a home.)


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm seeing "empty" rings or amulets that seem to do absolutely 
nothing. Is there any point to them, or are they just flavor?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Empty rings and amulets are not directly useful, but they can be 
used as the base item for a potentially useful artifact reforge.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I put a Ring of Combat on my finger, but it doesn't seem to do 
anything, what's wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Melee rings, like Rings of Combat, only affect the weapon in the 
corresponding hand; so a Ring of Combat worn on your right hand only 
affects the weapon in your right hand (if any), and a Ring of Combat 
worn on your left hand only affects the weapon in your left hand. (If 
you wield a single weapon with both hands, both rings will apply to 
it.)


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How does Free Action work in FrogComposband?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Free Action provides protection from paralysis, a potentially lethal 
condition. One level of Free Action provides partial protection and 
helps recover faster if you do get paralyzed; two levels of Free Action 
provide complete protection against low-level monsters and very good 
protection against high-level monsters; three levels of Free Action 
provide complete protection against paralysis, except in the special 
case of the Ancient Foul Curse.

How good "imperfect" Free Action (one level of protection in the early 
game, or one or two levels in the late game) is depends on the level of 
the attacking monster, and also on your saving throw. The better your 
saving throw is, the less of a risk you're taking by not having three 
levels of Free Action.

In many other Angband variants one source of Free Action is enough to 
give complete paralysis immunity; if you've played such variants, be 
careful not to rely too much on a single Free Action source in 
FrogComposband.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Is there any way to gain paralysis immunity even against the Ancient 
Foul Curse?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">A good saving throw improves your chances of not being paralyzed by 
the curse. With a sufficiently good saving throw the chances of being 
paralyzed by the curse become zero. Anti-Magic items push your saving 
throw up to this level, but can be inconvenient for characters that 
rely heavily on magic.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How does See Invisible work in FrogComposband?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Every level of See Invisible improves your chances of noticing an 
invisible creature. How good those chances become depends on the level 
of the monster (high-level monsters are harder to see) and on your 
Searching skill. Sometimes an invisible creature flickers in and out of 
sight - now you make the sight roll, the next turn you don't. If you 
have several sources of See Invisible and still have trouble seeing 
invisible creatures, you may need either Telepathy or an item that 
improves your Searching skill.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I tried to dual wield two weapons.  But I couldn't hit anything!

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You need to practice your dual wielding skill (proficiency level) 
and your weapon skills.  Hitting high level monsters many times will 
improve your skills.  Note that the information command '~' reveals 
your proficiency levels.  Some classes are very bad at dual-wielding, 
while others are much more adept at it or can become so with enough 
training. If you try to dual-wield on a sniper and it doesn't work out, 
don't let that discourage you from dual-wielding on a ninja.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do skills (proficiency levels) work?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Weapon proficiency levels and dual wielding proficiency levels 
increase your to-hit bonus.  Spell proficiency levels decrease fail 
rate and mana consumption rate of spells.  Riding proficiency level 
gives you more speed when you are riding on a high speed monster, and 
decreases risk of falling from your mount.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I increase my proficiency level?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Proficiency level of a weapon will increase when you hit a monster 
whose level is high enough compared to your character level and to your 
current proficiency. Proficiency level of a spell will increase when 
you cast the spell at a dungeon level deep enough compared with the 
spell level. The needed conditions to increase riding proficiency are 
rather complex; generally, you need to hit a monster whose level is 
high enough compared with current riding proficiency level or to shoot 
a monster while riding on a high level mount.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm a level 15 ranger and have been shooting everybody from the 
beginning, but my short bow proficiency is still Beginner (+0). Is 
something wrong?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Beginner (+0) doesn't sound great, but it's a lot better than 
Unskilled (-20), and is good enough you need to shoot monsters of 
native level 15 (or deeper) to get your proficiency up to +1.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm a fighter type and rely largely on melee. Which weapon should I 
use?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">In the very early game, you should usually use the weapon that does 
the most damage. Press Shift+C to see the character sheet, which 
displays your melee damage and melee to-hit. You should look at both to 
determine how good a weapon is - it's no use having a weapon that 
technically does lots of damage if you can't hit anything with it! Also 
remember, though, that your to-hit percentages will improve rapidly as 
your proficiency with a weapon increases. Don't worry too much about 
starting with a -20 proficiency - unless that's your proficiency cap 
for the weapon, or if the weapon is an icky wield.

As you start finding {excellent} weapons and artifacts, you may well 
want to wield a particular weapon for the resists, bonuses or abilities 
it provides, even if you have another weapon that would do more damage. 
A dead character has no use for a high damage output.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What is an "Icky Wield"?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Some classes have a very strong preference for a certain weapon or 
type of weapon, to the extent that other weapons are marked as icky. 
The exact effects of wielding an icky weapon depend on class, but as a 
general rule you should always assume that an icky weapon will be worse 
than a non-icky one, at least from a melee perspective. In the specific 
case of Priests, however, the melee penalty is relatively small and the 
main drawback of an icky weapon is its effect on prayer fail rates.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Some weapons have slays (like Slay Orc) or brands (like Viper's 
Fang). What do these mean?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Slays and brands do extra damage against the appropriate monsters 
(so Slay Orc does extra damage against orcs, and Viper's Fang does 
extra damage against monsters who don't resist poison). Slays and 
brands work by multiplying the weapon's dice (which makes them much 
more valuable on a 5d6 blade of chaos than on a 1d5 dagger).

If a weapon has multiple slays or brands that could apply to the same 
monster, only the strongest slay or brand (the highest multiplier) is 
applied; slays and brands never combine, with two exceptions. The first 
is Force (Mana Brand), which fully combines with other slays. The other 
is Mark of Chaos, which rolls a random slay or brand for each blow; if 
the weapon also has other slays or brands, the Mark of Chaos sometimes 
combines with them and makes them slightly stronger.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I'm in a very dangerous spot, but there's a trap door right next to 
me. Is there any way I can deliberately fall through the trap door 
without making the automatic attempt to disarm it?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Use the '-' key, followed by the direction, to deliberately walk 
into the trap.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I ride on a monster?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">At first, summon, charm or capture some suitable monster. Then use 
the pet menu command 'p'.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I use a Capture Ball?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Equip it and activate ('A') to a dying monster.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I cannot hold a weapon and a shield without losing control of my 
horse.  My horse runs aimlessly!

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You cannot directly control your mount unless you use one hand to 
control your mount.  But you can command your mount.  Just use 'p' 
command, and give your mount a target.  The horse which was given a 
target will no longer run around aimlessly.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I have acquired a mutation! Is that bad?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Some mutations are good, while others are bad. Two towns - Zul and 
Anambar - offer a "cure mutation" service that allows you to get rid of 
bad mutations (the Zul service is much cheaper). Note, though, that you 
don't get to choose which mutation is removed - you might be "cured" of 
a good mutation, with the bad one staying in place...

Potions of New Life also cure mutations among their other effects, and 
potions of Polymorph both give and cure mutations at random.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How important is Telepathy?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Full telepathy is extremely nice to have - it tells you about 
approaching threats, helps you locate fleeing or blinking enemies, and 
even allows you to spot monsters that might otherwise be invisible to 
you. However, it is still more of a convenience than something that you 
absolutely need, especially if you have easy and reliable access to 
Detection and have no or minimal problems seeing invisible creatures. A 
player without telepathy needs to detect monsters more often but can 
usually get by. Staves of Telepathy are also a handy option for players 
without permanent telepathy.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What does Reflection do? How important is it?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">It gives you a 75% chance of reflecting any incoming bolt or 
bolt-like attack. A reflected bolt will not damage you in any way, and 
may bounce back and damage the monster that fired it in the first 
place. Some monsters also have Reflection - in this case, they have a 
75% chance of reflecting your bolt attacks, potentially back at you. If 
both you and the monster have Reflection, it's possible for a bolt to 
bounce between you two for a while... The main difference between 
monster reflection and player reflection is that monsters cannot 
reflect actual crossbow bolts (or arrows, sling ammo etc.) but you can 
reflect monster arrows.

Reflection is very helpful (and remains useful throughout the game) but 
is never really absolutely needed. Early on, it's particularly useful 
in the Camelot dungeon, which has many dangerous bolt casters.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What do monsters' vampiric attacks do?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">They drain life from you, thereby healing the monster, increasing 
its maximum HP and consuming your life points.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Are Unlife attacks the same as vampiric attacks?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Unlife attacks are very similar to vampiric attacks, but instead of 
healing the monster or increasing its maximum HP they make the monster 
more powerful. A powerful monster has a higher AC, hits harder and 
casts more dangerous spells, but its maximum HP is not increased.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What do the player's vampiric attacks do?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">They drain life from the target monster; the monster will lose HP 
like on a normal attack, but in addition its max HP will be lowered 
slightly, and you will recover either a small amount of life points or 
a small amount of HP, should you need either. (If both your life points 
and hit points have fallen below the maximum, your life points will 
recover first.) Vampiric attacks are very useful and powerful; however, 
they only work on living monsters. Many strong monsters, like golems, 
vortices, demons, undead and the Serpent of Chaos, are immune to 
vampirism.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What are "life points", anyway?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Life points determine your effective maximum HP. Normally, your 
effective max HP and displayed max HP will be identical; but if your 
life points fall below 100%, your effective max HP is lowered. Life 
points are only shown (e.g. "Life: </font><font color="#c08040">95%</font><font color="#ffffff">") if they fall below the 
maximum; a loss of a few points shouldn't worry you too much, but a 
more significant drop can ruin your day.

Since life points only account for half of your max HP, your max HP 
will never hit zero; accordingly, it is possible to run out of life 
points without being killed outright. If this happens, you will be 
permanently transformed into an undead - either a skeleton, a vampire, 
a zombie or a spectre - and regain full life points (or "unlife 
points") since the undead are immune to loss of life.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">My current HP is lower than my max HP - but it's still shown in 
green, not yellow, and it seems I can't heal any further. What's 
happening?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">You've hit your effective maximum HP, which is lower than your 
displayed maximum HP because you've lost life points.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How can I regain my lost life points?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Life points can be regained either through any type of vampiric 
attack, or by using a potion, device or activation. Potions of Restore 
Life Levels are a common way to regain life points, though they only 
restore up to 15 percentage points at a time.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">There's a building in Morivant that offers artifact reforging. What 
does that mean? Is it something I should do?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">For reforging, you need a source item - any artifact - and a 
destination item - any item that can be equipped and isn't already an 
artifact or ego item. (For rings and amulets this means an "empty" 
item, as all non-empty rings and amulets are considered ego items.) The 
original artifact will be destroyed, and the destination item is turned 
into a new artifact. The properties of the old artifact are not 
retained; however, if the destination item already had special 
properties despite being non-ego (e.g. resists on a dragon shield), 
those will be retained.

How powerful the new artifact will be depends mostly on the power of 
the source artifact. Usually it's going to be somewhat less powerful 
than the source, especially if the source artifact represented a 
"strong" slot (the strongest slots are the weapon slot and the body 
armor slot) while the target represented a weak slot (the weakest slots 
are lamps and amulets).

There are many reasons why reforging can be a good idea; for example, 
you may be unhappy with your item in a particular equipment slot, or 
you have an annoying resistance hole, or you have a very strong 
artifact that has a high score but for some reason isn't useful to you 
directly; or you're already wearing a non-ego item and want to upgrade 
it into an artifact. Ninjas (and Ninja-Lawyers) often reforge onto 
lamps, hoping to get an artifact lamp of darkness.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What kind of source artifacts should I use for reforging? What kind 
of destination items should I use?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Stronger artifacts give better results, so use the strongest 
artifact you have that you can afford to reforge and that doesn't 
exceed your reforge power limit. (Of course, don't use a source 
artifact that's already useful to you, since the reforge will consume 
it!) If you're reforging onto a weaker slot, consider using a source 
artifact that's strong for its slot, rather than strong in absolute 
terms; this way, less power is lost to a slot downgrade. (For example, 
if you want a lamp, and you have artifact gloves with a 40K score and 
artifact armor with a 70K score, use the gloves; the two items will 
produce similar lamps, but the armor will produce a much better armor 
or weapon since none of its power is lost to a slot downgrade.)

If possible, use a destination item that's already good in some useful 
way - for example, dragon wings that already have resistances you'd 
like, or a diamond edge with sharpness and high base damage - but not 
one that's already good in some way you don't need, since that would be 
lost value. Don't use a destination item that's too powerful compared 
to the source item, since the reforge would be left without much room 
for improvements.

Reforge from strong slots to strong slots, weak slots to weak slots, 
and - if necessary - strong slots to weak slots; but never reforge from 
a weak slot onto a strong slot.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What determines my reforge power limit?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Your reforge power limit is determined by how famous you are. You 
gain fame by completing quests, turning in wanted monsters, killing 
enemies in the Thalos arena, and killing uniques (especially high-level 
uniques). You lose fame by failing quests or being defeated in an Arena 
fight. There is a soft reforge-power limit of 90000 or slot-adjusted 
equivalent - it is possible for a sufficiently famous player to use a 
source artifact that exceeds this limit, but the extra power will be 
ignored.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">When should I reforge?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Reforging is at its best relatively late in the game, when you've 
both found many very strong artifacts and accrued enough fame to use 
them as source items. Don't be afraid of trying it out earlier, though, 
especially if you need something specific like a dark lamp.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What do Poison Needles do?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Poison needles are a special weapon. A poison needle only gets one 
hit per turn and usually only deals 1 damage on that hit; however, 
poison needle hits have a small chance of instantly killing any monster 
in the game, no matter how strong, unless it is a unique. Poison 
needles are often used to kill metal babbles, which are very difficult 
to kill through any other means. (The Metal Babble at the bottom of the 
Arena dungeon is technically a unique, but is still susceptible to a 
poison needle kill.)

Poison needles cannot be used in a reforge, and cannot be enchanted 
through any normal means. (Some classes, like Weaponsmiths, can use 
their special abilities to "enchant" a poison needle, but this has no 
actual effect on the needle's performance.) Poison needles have a 100% 
hit chance, unless the player is dual-wielding, in which case they have 
a 50% hit chance.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">How do I create a character dump?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">If your character is still alive, press Shift+C for the character 
sheet, then press | to dump it. If you're dead, the tombstone screen 
offers easy character dumping - simply type the filename you want 
(usually something like "name.html" or "name_dead.html") and press 
Enter. If you died earlier and forgot to take a character dump, access 
the character sheet through the high score list (the '~' key, followed 
by the 'H' key) and then press '|' as before. If you're playing on the 
angband.live online server and have trouble dumping your character 
(users on some keyboard/browser combinations have experienced problems 
using the '|' key online), you can request help from your fellow 
players; the angband.live high score list is shared between all 
players, so anyone can use it to create a dump of your character.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">I want to post my character dump to the ladder on angband.oook.cz. 
Should I use a TXT dump or an HTML dump?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Use an HTML dump.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What is the genesis of FrogComposband?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">FrogComposband is a fork of ComPosband, a fork of PosChengband, 
which was based on Chengband, which was based on Hengband, which was 
based on Japanese ZAngband, which was based on regular ZAngband, a fork 
of Angband, which was based on Moria and Umoria. (Whew!)

In addition to these direct ancestors, FrogComposband and its "family" 
have been strongly influenced by a number of other Angband variants, 
like KAngband, Posband, ToME and OAngband. FrogComposband specifically 
has also inherited quite a bit of content - starting with its name - 
from Frogspawn, an unpublished fork of vanilla Angband.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">What is the design philosophy of FrogComposband?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Above all else, FrogComposband aims to be 1) fun and 2) challenging. 
(It also aims to sneakily bring about Armageddon and the ascendancy of 
hyperintelligent robots.)

The pursuit of a fun game involves quite a few things. The game tries 
to be fair to the player - unavoidable deaths out of nowhere should be 
unknown or at least extremely rare, and non-lethal attacks should add 
to the challenge and atmosphere but not spoil the fun. (Some unpopular 
effects can be turned off in the birth options.) Normal play should 
always keep the player on his toes, offering new situations to tackle 
and new decisions to make. FrogComposband also has much humorous 
content to lighten the mood, some of it hidden to be discovered when 
least expected.

You decide what's fun and what isn't! The game allows many different 
playstyles, from speed-diving to a slow, methodical grind, without 
trying to enforce any one of them on the player. It is also designed to 
be highly customizable, with about 100 options and a number of other 
ways to modify things. I don't try to make the decisions for you, 
beyond providing generally popular default settings; every player wants 
different things.

Winning the game should be an achievement! FrogComposband attempts to 
not be easy, but also to avoid artificial difficulty of the "screw you, 
you're dead" type; a player who makes no mistakes and knows what he's 
doing should always have a good chance to win. The game also aims to be 
balanced; while some classes, races, items and spell realms are much 
stronger than others, none should be so strong as to make the game 
unchallenging or uninteresting.

The game should be infinitely replayable; different personalities, 
races and (especially) classes present very different challenges, and 
even two characters of the same race, class and personality can play 
very differently based on the decisions made, items found and monsters 
encountered.

The game is constantly evolving (and hopefully improving); it does not 
claim to have fully reached any of its aims yet, but it's trying to get 
closer and closer. Player feedback helps there!


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Who wrote Hengband?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Hengband is mainly based on ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version. 
ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version was developed by Mitsuhiro Itakura, 
based on both ZAngband 2.2.8 and Angband 2.8.3 Japanese version, and 
has some original features, for example, Auto-picker, in addition to 
simple translation.

Hengband also includes codes from many other variants including ToME, 
OAngband, etc.  Mr.Hoge wrote the first original part of Hengband.  And 
currently, it is maintained by Hengband Development Team including 
Mr.Hoge, Habu, Henkma, iks, Kuwa, Mogami and nsk.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">So is that why there is so much Japanese content in this game?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Yes, though it doesn't hurt that Japanese popular culture has many 
followers worldwide.


</font><font color="#00ff00">Q: </font><font color="#ffffff">Is there a more detailed help file?

</font><font color="#ff0000">A: </font><font color="#ffffff">Press '?' in-game to access the online help. If you are already 
using the online help to read this file, look at the other sections, 
which offer more detailed advice.
