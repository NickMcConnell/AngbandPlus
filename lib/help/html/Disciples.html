<font color="#00ffff">Disciples

</font><font color="#ffffff">Trusted followers of mysterious ancient spirits known as the 'Purples', 
the Disciples roam the world running errands for their masters, 
learning mighty spells and receiving rare items as rewards for their 
work. There are three main flavors of Purple Disciples - disciples of 
Karrot, disciples of Yeqrezh, and disciples of a group of Purples known 
as the Troika. Each of the Purples expects different things of their 
Disciples, and each helps them achieve their ends in very different 
ways.

<a name="Karrot"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Karrot
</font><font color="#ffffff">Karrot is a proud and ambitious Purple, convinced that it is his 
destiny to one day rule the universe; but rather than getting 
personally involved, he has assigned to his Disciples the task of 
eliminating any potential rivals (like the Serpent of Chaos). Being so 
sure of his greatness, Karrot sees little reason to vary his habits and 
is the only one of the Purples to predictably teach all of his 
Disciples the same spells. Karrot occasionally assigns side-quests to 
his Disciples, with the dual aim of testing their mettle and removing 
lesser threats to his supremacy. These side-quests only appear on 
fairly challenging levels; they can be avoided by sticking to safer 
areas, but this will not make Karrot happy...

Karrot considers many artifacts to be his rightful personal property, 
and will claim them immediately if you should find them. He will, 
however, give you another artifact as a reward for your discovery. 
These replacement artifacts tend to start out as fairly weak, but 
eventually become very strong as you gain Karrot's respect by leveling 
up and by successfully completing side-quests. If you're really lucky 
and do a particularly good job, you might even receive the ultimate 
gift - Urog, Karrot's legendary blade of shadows!

Disciples of Karrot tend to play as fighter-mages, relying on melee, 
spells and devices alike. They are unique among Disciples in not having 
a mana pool; casting a spell takes a toll on their hit points instead. 
They are also the only Disciples to have a charming spell - but the 
greatest of Karrot's followers are rumoured to eventually learn even 
rarer abilities...
Karrot's disciples depend on Intelligence to make their spells work.

<a name="Yeqrezh"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Yeqrezh
</font><font color="#ffffff">Yeqrezh is the friendliest of the Purples, supportive of his Disciples 
and willing to let them find their own way. Disciples of Yeqrezh will 
learn 20 spells over the course of the game - one every two character 
levels, apart from levels 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50; seventeen of these 
spells are offered by Yeqrezh, while the other three (at levels 16, 32 
and 48) are chosen by you. Every ten levels, Yeqrezh offers direct help 
to his Disciples; depending on your choice, he can give you rare items 
or a permanent mental or physical ability, or share some of his life 
experience with you. Some of these abilities can be improved 
repeatedly, allowing you to accumulate exceptional mastery.

Disciples of Yeqrezh gain many practical tools as well as solid 
offensive options, and a useful item as a gift from their patron every 
odd-numbered character level. They are the most mage-like of all 
Disciples, and lack of hit points is their only true weakness. 
Nevertheless, they are extremely versatile, and can also win through 
melee, archery or even sneaking about silently collecting loot.

Yeqrezh is the recommended patron for new (or highly cautious) players, 
as he is the only Purple not to actively incentivize a demanding, 
push-the-envelope approach. Yeqrezh's disciples, like Karrot's, rely on 
Intelligence to power their spells.

<a name="Troika"></a></font><font color="#ff8000">Troika
</font><font color="#ffffff">The Troika is a group of three closely related Purples working together 
- Guntujant, Uxip and Sohoglyth. Guntujant is a capricious Purple who 
follows the careers of his servants very closely, and rewards and 
punishes them seemingly at random; the powers gained by his followers 
are unpredictable, but generally quite strong. Uxip delights in combat, 
and grants Troika disciples their prodigious endurance and skill with 
two-handed weapons; however, a number of common items are an 
abomination unto Uxip, and cannot be used by followers of the Troika. 
Sohoglyth is a mysterious spirit, but a profoundly powerful one. She 
occasionally sets bonus quests for Troika disciples; if enough of the 
quests are completed with no failures, she will reward the questor with 
the power of telepathy, remote object quality sensing, or even walking 
through walls.

Troika Disciples are in general very strong, especially in combat but 
also sorcery, yet the limitations placed upon them by Uxip and 
Guntujant also make them in some ways vulnerable. In particular, they 
frequently suffer random punishments, risk being punished if they 
teleport from a fight while not at low health, cannot wear a shield or 
cure poison with mushrooms, and must earn the right to use a rod of 
Detection. The spells of Troika disciples are unique in that they are 
not learned at any particular character level; instead, Guntujant and 
Uxip will teach them as a reward for killing dangerous enemies, 
especially uniques. Strength determines the spellcasting ability of a 
Troika disciple.

</font><font color="#00ffff">TIP</font><font color="#ffffff">: The special random quests for Karrot and Troika disciples can only 
appear if you are sufficiently deep for the quest to be challenging. 
Pressing </font><font color="#ffff00">CTRL+F </font><font color="#ffffff">reveals your patron's opinion of your current depth. 
The Purples also like you to visit many different dungeons; do not 
expect a large number of assignments in a single dungeon, unless you 
are playing with no wilderness.
