<font color="#00ffff">Monster Races

</font><font color="#ffffff">So, you feel ready to play as a monster? There are many monster races 
and subraces to choose from, and the various races are loosely grouped 
by type below: Animals, Dragons, Demons, and so forth.

As a monster, </font><font color="#ff00ff">you will not be able to choose a normal class; </font><font color="#ffffff">your race 
will essentially be your class as well. Monsters do not use book 
spells, but many of them are magical in other ways; for example, fire 
dragons can breathe fire and may gain access to a range of non-book 
spells. Most monster types gain new spells, powers or abilities with 
experience; check out both the magic command (</font><font color="#ff8000">m</font><font color="#ffffff">) and the racial power 
command (</font><font color="#ff8000">U</font><font color="#ffffff">/</font><font color="#ff8000">O</font><font color="#ffffff">) to see what powers are available to you as you play.

Most monster races have custom body types, which may severely constrain 
the amount and kind of equipment you may wear. For example, a </font><font color="#ff0000">Beholder 
</font><font color="#ffffff">cannot wear armor or wield a sword... that would be an odd sight 
indeed! But to make up for this, they can wear up to eight rings on 
their eyestalks. Generally, details of this kind are described below.

Finally, all monsters </font><font color="#ff0000">evolve</font><font color="#ffffff">. When they gain enough experience, they 
will assume a more powerful form. To continue with our example of 
dragons, you might evolve from Baby to Young to Mature to Ancient and 
finally to a Great Wyrm, becoming vastly more powerful in the process. 
The stats and skills listed below assume a level 35 character.

For details on the </font><font color="#ff0000">Stats</font><font color="#ffffff">, see <a href="birth.html#PrimaryStats"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">. For information about the </font><font color="#ff0000">Skills</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
see <a href="birth.html#PrimarySkills"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">. To compare the various races at a glance, take a look at the 
race tables below (<a href="MonsterRaces.html#Tables"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).

</font><font color="#c00000">Animal
<a name="Centipede"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Centipede
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Centipedes are natural creatures with many legs. As they evolve, they 
  change colors, but not much else seems to differentiate the various 
  forms. Perhaps you prefer blue to red or green? Eventually, once you 
  have evolved into your ultimate evolutionary form, you will be able 
  to change colors at will and thereby become very powerful indeed.
   
  As a centipede, your main survival attribute will be the many pairs 
  of boots you can wear. Hopefully, this will be enough.

<a name="Hound"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Hound
  </font><font color="#ffffff">While Zephyr Hounds typically hunt in packs, you have chosen to go it 
  alone. You will begin life in the weak form of a Clear Hound. As you 
  mature, you will take a number of evolutionary steps. At each such 
  step, the form you evolve into will be randomly determined; but each 
  tier offers more powerful choices than the last. Who knows - you may 
  even evolve into an Aether Hound some day.
   
  Hounds are not magical, and so cannot cast spells; however, they are 
  fantastic hunters, and learn a number of special abilities that will 
  aid them in this endeavour. And as you probably know all too well, 
  hounds love to breathe!
   
  Due to their canine bodies, Hounds cannot wield weapons; instead, 
  they attack with their vicious bite and razor-sharp claws. While 
  their melee is not as powerful as that of dragons, it usually gets 
  the job done. Hounds can wear four rings on their front paws, a pair 
  of boots on their hind legs, an amulet around their neck, and even a 
  cloak and a suit of body armor.

<a name="Hydra"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Hydra
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Hydras are monsters with multiple heads. As they evolve, they grow 
  additional heads, giving them extra attacks as well as the ability to 
  wear more equipment (helmets and amulets). While not every head may 
  wear a helmet and an amulet (imagine how powerful that would be!), 
  each head is capable of attacking; so an 11-headed hydra can attack 
  up to 11 times per round, provided it has enough strength and 
  dexterity to command such a fearsome arsenal.
   
  Hydras are not very magical, and so play much like warriors but with 
  a few extra abilities. Five- and seven-headed hydras resist poison 
  and gain a few poison-based attacks. Nine- and eleven-headed hydras 
  are creatures of flame: they resist fire, their attacks burn, and 
  they are capable of breathing fire among other flame-based attacks. 
  All hydras regenerate extremely rapidly.

<a name="Spider"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Spider
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Spiders are stealthy monsters that prefer to wait for their prey. 
  They have poisonous attacks and can weave sticky webs to entangle 
  their enemies. They have eight legs, enough for four rings and two 
  pairs of boots; they may also wear a helmet, an amulet, a cloak and 
  even a suit of body armor (after slight adjustments, of course), but 
  cannot wield a weapon or a bow. They also cannot equip light sources, 
  but this is not an issue, as spiders are accustomed to the dark.
   
  There are two paths of evolution for the spider: the Phase Spider and 
  the Aranea. Araneas have greater fortitude and better stats, as well 
  as powerful melee capable of paralyzing an opponent; but Phase 
  Spiders compensate for their relative fragility with unsurpassed 
  powers of teleportation.
   
  All spiders begin in the very weak form of the Cave Spider. Lacking 
  any special talents, the cave spider must play carefully if it is to 
  survive.

<a name="Angel"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Angel
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Angels are heavenly beings on a holy mission. Their wings allow them 
  to fly over chasms and pits. They are rarely fooled by invisibility, 
  and become resistant to the elements as they mature. Their stats are 
  truly awe-inspiring, and their divine magic extremely strong, 
  offering good offense combined with detection, healing, melee 
  enhancement and utility. Angels are one of the most powerful races, 
  but they also gain levels extremely slowly.
   
  Angels have a humanoid body type; they use the same equipment slots 
  as most normal player races, and have no innate melee attacks. Wisdom 
  is their primary spell stat.

<a name="Demon"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Demon
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Demons are powerful servants of evil and come in many forms. They 
  rely on their devilish powers or their brutish strength to survive.
   
  The various demonic races include the Balrogs, powerful demons of 
  fire; the Servants of Khorne, mighty warriors of destruction; the 
  Tanar'ri, weaker demons whose ultimate form has three sets of arms, 
  but prefers to fight naked; and Cyberdemons, whose firepower is 
  unsurpassable.
   
  Demons cannot eat normal food, but must feast upon the remains of 
  their human enemies. They are unaffected by the Eldritch Horror.
  
  See <a href="Demons.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more details on demons.
  
  
</font><font color="#c00000">Beholder
<a name="Beholder"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Beholder
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Beholders are floating orbs of flesh with a single central eye 
  surrounded by numerous smaller eyestalks. They attack with their gaze 
  which often confuses or even paralyzes their foes. They are unable to 
  wield normal weapons or armor, but may equip a single ring on each of 
  their eyestalks, and the number of eyestalks increases as the 
  beholder evolves.
   
  Beholders gain powers as they evolve, including some strong offensive 
  spells; but their primary offense will always be their powerful gaze. 
  Intelligence is their spell stat, and beholders are quite intelligent 
  indeed. Their searching and perception are legendary, and they are 
  quite capable with magical devices. However, they are not very strong 
  and must be careful when surrounded by foes.
   
  The attack of the beholder is unique. Since their gaze is not a 
  normal physical attack, they receive no benefit to melee from their 
  Strength and Dexterity. Also, the number of attacks is determined by 
  level rather than the normal way: in this respect, they resemble 
  monks. Finally, the beholder need not be next to their foes in order 
  to attack with melee; they may gaze at distant monsters, though the 
  range of their gaze is somewhat restricted, and prolonged 
  long-distant gazing will tire them out.

</font><font color="#c00000">Dragon
<a name="Dragon"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Dragon
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Dragons are powerful winged serpents. They are strong in combat, with 
  razor-sharp claws and a bone-crushing bite; but even more legendary 
  is their breath, which grows ever more deadly as the dragon matures.
   
  Due to their non-humanoid bodies, dragons are unable to wear armor, 
  gloves or boots; however, being creatures of magic, they may equip up 
  to six rings. They can also wear a helmet, a light source, a cloak 
  and an amulet. Because of these equipment restrictions, dragons may 
  have a difficult time covering all resistances; but each dragon has 
  at least one innate resistance, maybe even an immunity.
   
  Dragons begin life in a weak form, being very young. As their bodies 
  mature, their scales grow tough and their claws sharp. Their breaths 
  become stronger and stronger, and they frequently gain additional 
  magical powers and resistances. All dragons can fly, but younger 
  dragons are not so quick as their elders.
   
  With the exception of Steel Dragons, who are far less intelligent 
  than their kin and rely on brute force only, each dragon may choose 
  to specialize in a specific type of magic. These special dragon-magic 
  realms do not require books to learn. The selection of a realm has a 
  direct influence on the stats and skills of the dragon.

</font><font color="#c00000">Elemental/Vortex
<a name="Elemental"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Elemental
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Elementals are mindless creatures animated from a single elemental 
  form. As a species, elementals can never be cut, and being virtually 
  mindless they are immune to sanity blasting. They rarely feel fear, 
  and are resistant to confusion and poison. In addition, they gain 
  specific powers and abilities depending on their form.
   
  Earth Elementals are slow, but gain AC bonuses due to their tough 
  bodies. They are resistant to shards, and may even turn their skins 
  to stone. At home in elemental earth, they may travel freely through 
  rocky confines. Unfortunately, as they are made of earth, their magic 
  potions frequently turn to mud!
   
  Air Elementals are shockingly fast, but perhaps that is just the 
  crackle of their electrified bodies? They may hurl bolts and balls of 
  electricity at their enemies, and may even imbue their weapons with 
  deadly lightning. However, being surrounded by lightning, rings, 
  amulets, wands and rods are quickly destroyed!
   
  Fire Elementals are somewhat fast (enough to run circles around their 
  earthen brethren) and are cloaked in flames. They may attack with 
  hell's fury, but need to be on the lookout for cold-wielding foes. 
  Being surrounded by fire, they rapidly burn scrolls and staves to 
  ash!
   
  Finally, there are the Water Elementals, creatures able to conjure 
  deadly water bolts. They are immune to stunning. Their attacks can be 
  quite corrosive; but alas, sometimes their own armor corrodes as 
  well. Water Elementals also have a unique energy system based on the 
  speed of their internal water flow; fighting and the use of elemental 
  powers excite them and turn them into a raging torrent, while resting 
  or aimlessly splashing about slows them down again. High flow rates 
  make water elementals stronger, but their armor sometimes gets caught 
  in the flow and slips off!

<a name="Vortex"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Vortex
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Vortices are mindless whirlwinds of elemental forces twirling their 
  way through the dungeon in search of prey. They are seldom confused 
  and never blinded since they lack vision in the normal sense; indeed, 
  they seem to be aware of their surroundings even without eyes, and 
  need not wear a light source. They can be neither stunned nor cut, 
  and their mindless nature renders them immune to fear. But, alas! 
  they are hopeless with magical devices and somewhat weak in melee; 
  and while they may breathe almost effortlessly, their breath attacks 
  are not particularly strong.
   
  Vortices do not have normal bodies; rather, they are simply a rapidly 
  spinning elemental mass. As such, they may incorporate objects into 
  their rotating essence, gaining bonuses and protection in the 
  process. The number of objects they may use increases with level, and 
  there are no restrictions on the types of equipment they may 'wield' 
  in each slot. While they may equip weapons this way, they cannot 
  attack with them; instead, the vortex may engulf nearby monsters with 
  their elemental essence.
   
  Vortices evolve randomly, though all seem to end up with the 
  evolutionary perfection of the Aether vortex. At level 50 they gain a 
  special talent to augment their power.

  </font><font color="#ffffff">Golems are creatures animated by powerful magics: living stone 
  conjured to serve their creators. But you have broken loose and are 
  running amok!
   
  Golems are very slow when it comes to moving about; their 
  non-movement actions also tend to be slow, but not to the same 
  extent. They excel in melee despite being limited to a single (but 
  mighty) blow; they can equip a weapon, but fight much better with 
  their powerful fists. Golems have a very high armor class and possess 
  good resistances; they are also resistant to magic, and become more 
  resistant as they evolve, reducing the damage taken from all magical 
  attacks.
   
  There are several varieties of golem, all sharing a common 
  evolutionary heritage. First there is the mighty Colossus, the 
  biggest (and slowest) of their kind. Next is the Sky Golem, a 
  creature of powerful magic, resistant to the ravages of time. 
  Finally, there is the Spellwarp Automaton, a creature of utter 
  destruction, almost completely immune to magic; unfortunately, this 
  last form takes nearly forever to build.

<a name="Jelly"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Jelly
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Jellies are acidic creatures, quietly patrolling their surroundings 
  in search of objects to absorb. They are quite stealthy for most of 
  their lives. They don't wear equipment on their bodies the way normal 
  races do; instead, they are capable of absorbing objects into their 
  gelatinous frames. In fact, each of their equipment slots (except 
  their pseudopod) is capable of holding any type of equipment 
  whatsoever, and the number of slots increases with experience. For 
  attacking, jellies are capable of forming a single pseudopod which 
  they may either use for grasping a normal melee weapon, or leave 
  empty to use their innate acid-based attacks.
   
  Rather than relying on sight, jellies use a little-understood sense 
  of their surroundings which allows them to see in the dark with 
  neither light nor infravision. So while jellies can equip a torch or 
  lantern, there is little reason for them to do so.
   
  Jellies feed off the objects they find, gaining nutrition in 
  proportion to the weight of the object absorbed. They can eat rations 
  of food if desired, but these are so light as to offer very little 
  nutritional value. Jellies prefer to eat heavy armors and weapons. 
  For convenience, destroyed objects are automatically eaten; and 
  jellies never become bloated, their appetite being insatiable.
   
  Jellies begin life as a small puddle of black ooze, with very little 
  carrying capacity for equipment. However, they quickly evolve into a 
  Gelatinous Cube and then into an Acidic Cytoplasm. Jellies take one 
  additional, powerful evolutionary step late in life.

<a name="Leprechaun"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Leprechaun
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Leprechauns are small, mischievous creatures, always scheming for 
  gold. They are weak, but quick and stealthy. For combat, they prefer 
  not to use weapons at all; rather, by keeping their weapon hand free, 
  they may pilfer objects or gold from their foes and flee to safety, 
  all in a single action. They are capable of fighting with normal 
  weapons should the need arise, but one seldom hears of leprechauns 
  inspiring fear in combat!
   
  Leprechauns value riches above all else, and even begin the game with 
  their legendary pot of gold. Leprechauns also have the luck of the 
  Irish, and good drops are more common for them. For magic, the 
  leprechaun has a few talents, even including some curses for offense; 
  Malicious Leprechauns and Death Leprechauns are vile, evil creatures, 
  after all. They are masters of teleportation and detection; and while 
  their melee skills do not inspire much fear (except of poverty), they 
  are great masters of bow and device alike. At high levels, they move 
  with incredible speed and seem to be in multiple places at once. 
  Dexterity determines the leprechaun's skill with their magic.
   
  A leprechaun uses gold for spellcasting the way most characters use 
  mana. Gold is also used to pay for recharging devices or to power 
  mana branded weapons. In addition, increasing the amount of gold on 
  hand increases the power of the leprechaun, granting extra blows per 
  round, extra shots per round, and increased AC and life rating; 
  sufficient gold even increases the power of magical devices. Needless 
  to say, greed is good when you're a leprechaun!

<a name="Mimic"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Mimic
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Mimics are similar to Possessors; but instead of controlling the 
  corpses of the vanquished, the mimic imitates those about them. This 
  allows the mimic to assume the forms of foes they have yet to 
  conquer, which is quite useful. However, there is a small catch: 
  mimics can only copy what they see! This limitation forces a mimic to 
  change forms much more often than a possessor would, as knowledge of 
  their current body rapidly fades when the original is no longer 
  about. Occasionally, the mimic is able to memorize a particular form 
  well enough to use it again without the original body to imitate, 
  though this does not happen very often and the mimic can only 
  memorize a small number of forms. To have a chance of this, the mimic 
  must be in the desired form when slaying the original.
   
  The stats, skills, spells, resistances and innate powers of a mimic 
  are determined by the form they assume; be sure to check both the 
  racial power command (</font><font color="#ff8000">U</font><font color="#ffffff">/</font><font color="#ff8000">O</font><font color="#ffffff">) and the magic command (</font><font color="#ff8000">m</font><font color="#ffffff">) after assuming a 
  new body. The current form also determines the spell stat; for 
  example, a novice priest mimic uses wisdom, while a novice mage mimic 
  relies on intelligence.

<a name="Possessor"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Possessor
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The Possessor is an odd creature, completely harmless in its natural 
  form. However, they are capable of possessing the corpses of monsters 
  they have slain, and gain powers and abilities based on their current 
  body. As such, they can become quite powerful indeed! Unfortunately, 
  not every type of monster will drop a corpse, and getting suitable 
  corspes to inhabit can be difficult. If the possessor ever leaves 
  their current body, all of their equipment will be removed (except a 
  light source) and they will temporarily return to their native, 
  vulnerable state. Finally, leaving their current body will destroy 
  that corpse most of the time, so the possessor should only do so if 
  they have a better corpse on hand (and also only if there are no 
  monsters nearby!). Possessors normally have full control of the body 
  they inhabit; but at very low health this control becomes hard to 
  maintain, and a possessor who suffers serious damage has a small 
  chance of being ejected from the body.
   
  The stats, skills, spells, resistances and innate powers of a 
  possessor are determined by the body they inhabit; be sure to check 
  both the racial power command (</font><font color="#ff8000">U</font><font color="#ffffff">/</font><font color="#ff8000">O</font><font color="#ffffff">) and the magic command (</font><font color="#ff8000">m</font><font color="#ffffff">) after 
  possessing a new body. The current body also determines the spell 
  stat; for example, a novice priest possessor uses wisdom, while a 
  novice mage possessor relies on intelligence.

  Rings cannot wear normal equipment; rather, they simply are a ring, 
  magically enchanted. Rings have a small arsenal of innate powers. 
  Since the ring is unable to move on its own, it will need to lure a 
  nearby monster into wearing it. Magic rings tend to corrupt their 
  owners, and over time, the ring-bearer will find that his will is not 
  his own!
   
  Rings can absorb magic from the jewelry (rings or amulets) that they 
  find, and gain resistances, attributes and additional spells this 
  way. Rings have no physical attacks; instead, they may blast enemies 
  with mighty spells (once absorbed, of course), or they may simply lie 
  back and let their current bearer do the fighting for them.

  are the mighty Hrus; they are so strong they can eventually crush the 
  walls in their path, but their magical powers are fairly limited.
   
  Giants rely on their superior physical stature to pummel their 
  opponents with mighty blows. Against a distant foe, giants are 
  capable of hurling large boulders with devastating effect. Giants use 
  the same equipment slots as most normal player races, and have no 
  innate attacks.

<a name="Orc"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Orc
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Orcs are Morgoth's creation and the backbone of his armies. They are 
  accustomed to caves and tunnels, and resist darkness but tend to be 
  vulnerable to light. Orcs are ugly, brutish pillagers by reputation 
  and should not expect much love from shopkeepers. Morgoth's spirit 
  lives in orcs and drives them forward, making them hard to frighten. 
  What orcs lack in stealth and subtlety they make up for with their 
  sheer brute strength, and generally have little trouble brushing 
  aside weak enemies like kobolds; yet in the deep dungeons, where the 
  strongest fighters and most powerful magicians reside, orcs are 
  rarely seen.
  
  See <a href="Orcs.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[h]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more details on orcs.

<a name="Lich"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Lich
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Liches are the undead forms of former sorcerers. Their magic is 
  strong, but their fighting skills weak. As undead, they quickly gain 
  resistance to cold, poison and nether, and these resistances increase 
  as the lich evolves.
   
  Liches are born with magical powers, and gain additional powers as 
  they advance; of all the monster races, none can surpass the 
  firepower of an Archlich, but managing to evolve that far can be a 
  challenge. Intelligence is the primary spell stat.
   
  Liches are humanoid, and so use the standard set of equipment items; 
  but should they forgo the use of a normal weapon, they may touch 
  their opponents for various powerful effects. Even with this deadly 
  touch, though, melee will never be their strong suit.

<a name="Vampire"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Vampire
  </font><font color="#ffffff">One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an awe-inspiring 
  sight. Yet this dread creature has a serious weakness: the bright 
  rays of sun are its bane, and it will need to flee the surface to the 
  deep recesses of earth until the sun finally sets. Being undead, 
  Vampires resist nether and have a firm hold on their life force; 
  vampires also resists cold and poison, and darkness only makes them 
  feel at home. Vampires are, however, susceptible to their perpetual 
  hunger for fresh blood, which can only be satiated by sucking blood 
  from a nearby monster.
   
  Vampires gain access to various dark powers as they evolve. Of 
  course, they gain a vampiric bite at a very early stage, as they must 
  use this power to feed on the living. Killing humans with this power 
  is also a means of perpetuating the vampire species, and many are the 
  servants of true prince of darkness! Vampires are rumored to have 
  limited shapeshifting abilities and a powerful, hypnotic gaze.

  make up for it by the many lights they can store within their body. 
  Also, the bites of the deadliest pumpkins are said to be vampiric...

<a name="Xorn"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Xorn
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Xorns are massive creatures of earth. They begin life as an Umber 
  Hulk, a bizarre creature with large mandibles capable of slicing 
  through rock and glaring eyes capable of confusing foes. At this 
  stage in their evolution their body is vaguely humanoid, allowing 
  them to wear a helmet, an amulet, a cloak and even a pair of boots; 
  once the Umber Hulk evolves further, however, it can no longer wear 
  these items. Instead, a grown Xorn can use its four massive arms for 
  weapons, shields, rings and gloves; mature Xorns can also pass 
  effortlessly through rock.
   
  Xorns have no active magical powers, but instead rely on their 
  ability to hide in rocks and the advantage that their extra arms 
  provide them in melee. Xorns, like most warrior characters, are very 
  effective at killing monsters but have problems with advanced magic 
  devices.
