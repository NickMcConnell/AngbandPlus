<font color="#00ffff">Monster Races

</font><font color="#ffffff">So, you have decided to play as a monster. There are many options to 
choose from and the various types of monsters are loosely grouped by 
type below: Animals, Dragons, Demons, etc.

As a monster, you won't be able to choose a class the way normal 
players do. Rather, most monster types gain abilities and powers as 
they gain experience. For example, dragons can breathe fire as well as 
access magical abilities. So you will want to check out both the magic 
command (</font><font color="#ff8000">m</font><font color="#ffffff">) as well as the racial power command (</font><font color="#ff8000">U </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff8000">O</font><font color="#ffffff">) to see what 
powers are available as you play.

In addition, most monsters have custom body types, and this will 
severely constrain the amount and kind of equipment you may wear. For 
example, a beholder cannot wear armor or wield a sword ... That would 
be an odd sight indeed! Instead, they may wear rings on their numerous 
eyestalks. Details of this kind should be described below.

Finally, all monsters evolve. When they gain enough experience, they 
will assume a more powerful form. To continue with our example of 
dragons, you might evolve from Baby to Young to Mature and finally 
Ancient forms, becoming vastly more powerful in the process. The stats 
and skills listed in this document only apply to the starting form, 
which is usually very weak.

For details on the </font><font color="#ff0000">Primary Statistics</font><font color="#ffffff">, see <a href="birth.html#PrimaryStats"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">. For information about 
the various </font><font color="#ff0000">Skills</font><font color="#ffffff">, see <a href="birth.html#PrimarySkills"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">. To compare the various races at a glance, 
you might want to take a look at <a href="MonsterRaces.html#Tables"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">the race tables below.

</font><font color="#c00000">Animal
<a name="Centipede"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Centipede
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Centipedes are natural creatures with many legs. As they evolve, they 
  change colors, but not much else seems to differentiate the various 
  forms. Perhaps you prefer blue to red or green? Eventually, once you 
  have evolved into your ultimate evolutionary form, you will be able 
  to change colors at will and thereby become very powerful indeed.
   
  As a centipede, your main survival attribute will be the many pairs 
  of boots you can wear. Hopefully, this will be enough.

<a name="Hound"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Hound
  </font><font color="#ffffff">While Hounds typically hunt in packs, you have chosen to go it alone. 
  You will begin life in the weak form of a Clear Hound. As you mature 
  you will take a number of evolutionary steps. At each such step, the 
  form you evolve into will be randomly determined. But each tier 
  offers more powerful choices than the last and who knows? You may 
  even evolve into an Aether Hound some day.
   
  Hounds are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. They are not 
  magical so cannot cast spells. However, they are fantastic hunters so 
  learn a small number of abilities to aid in this endeavor. And of 
  course, you are probably aware that hounds love to breathe!
   
  The body of the Hound is canine, so they cannot wield weapons. 
  Instead, they attack with their vicious bite and razor sharp claws. 
  They are not so powerful in melee as are dragons, but they are not 
  that bad either. Hounds can wear four rings on their front paws, a 
  pair of boots on their hind legs, an amulet around their neck and 
  even a cloak and a suit of body armor.

<a name="Hydra"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Hydra
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Hydras are monsters with multiple heads. As they evolve, they grow 
  additional heads granting the potential for extra attacks as well as 
  the ability to wear more equipment (helmets and amulets). While not 
  every head may wear a helmet and an amulet (This would be too 
  powerful), each head is capable of attacking. So the 11-headed hydra 
  can attack up to 11 times per round, provided it has enough strength 
  and dexterity to command such a fearsome arsenal.
   
  Hydras are monsters so do not choose a normal class. Instead, they 
  play much like warriors with a few limited abilities. All hydras 
  regenerate quickly and 5 and 7-headed hydras resist poison and gain a 
  few poison based attacks. 9 and 11-headed hydras are creatures of 
  flame: Their attacks burn and they are capable of breathing fire 
  among other flame based attacks. They resist fire as well.

<a name="Spider"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Spider
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Spiders are stealthy monsters that prefer to wait for their prey. 
  They have poisonous attacks and can weave sticky webs to entangle 
  their enemies. They have 8 legs, 4 of which may wear rings and the 
  remaining may equip 2 pairs of boots. They are unable to wield 
  weapons or bows, but may wear a helmet, an amulet, a cloak and even a 
  suit of body armor (after slight adjustments, of course). They cannot 
  wield a light source, but this is not an issue as spiders have grown 
  accustomed to the dark.
   
  There are two paths of evolution for the spider: The Phase Spider and 
  The Aranea. The former is somewhat weaker than the latter in 
  fortitude, stats and melee, but this is compensated by the Phase 
  Spider's amazing powers of teleportation. However, the Elder Aranea's 
  poison touch is more powerful than that of the Phase Spider and often 
  paralyzes its opponents.
   
  All spiders begin in the very weak form of the Cave Spider. Lacking 
  any special talents, the cave spider must play carefully if it is to 
  survive.

</font><font color="#c00000">Angel/Demon
<a name="Angel"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Angel
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Angels are heavenly beings on a holy mission. They are winged 
  creatures able to fly over chasms and pits. They also become 
  resistant to the elements as they mature and are not fooled by 
  invisibility. Their stats are truly awe-inspiring making them one of 
  the most powerful monster races.
   
  Angels are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. Instead, they 
  rely on their divine powers which function like spells but need not 
  be learned or cast from books. These powers can be used while 
  blinded, but not while confused and they are also blocked by 
  Anti-magic. The divine powers of the angel are quite powerful 
  offering good offense combined with detection, healing and melee 
  enhancement. Wisdom is the primary spell stat.
   
  Angels use the same equipment slots as normal player races and have 
  no innate attacks.

<a name="Demon"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Demon
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Demons are powerful servants of evil and come in many forms. Being 
  monsters, they may not choose a normal class. Instead, they rely on 
  their devilish powers or their brutish strength to survive.
   
  The various demonic races include the Balrog, powerful demons of 
  fire; the Servants of Khorne, mighty warriors of destruction; the 
  Tanar'ri, weaker demons whose ultimate form has three sets of arms, 
  but prefers to fight naked; and Cyberdemons, whose firepower is 
  unsurpassable.
   
  All demon races cannot eat normal food, but must feast upon the 
  remains of their human enemies. They are unaffected by the Eldritch 
  Horror.
  
  See <a href="Demons.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more details on demons.
  
  
</font><font color="#c00000">Beholder
<a name="Beholder"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Beholder
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Beholders are floating orbs of flesh with a single central eye 
  surrounded by numerous smaller eyestalks. They attack with their gaze 
  which often confuses or even paralyzes their foes. They are unable to 
  wield normal weapons or armor, but may equip a single ring on each of 
  their eyestalks, and the number of eyestalks increases as the 
  beholder evolves.
   
  Beholders are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. Instead, they 
  gain powers as they evolve, including some limited offensive 
  capabilities. But the beholders primary offense will always be their 
  powerful gaze. Intelligence is the primary spell stat and beholders 
  are quite intelligent indeed. Their searching and perception are 
  legendary and they are quite capable with magical devices. However, 
  they are not very strong and won't be able to stand long against 
  multiple foes.
   
  The attack of the beholder is unique. Since their gaze is not a 
  normal physical attack, they receive no benefit to melee from their 
  Strength and Dexterity. Also, the number of attacks is determined by 
  level rather than the normal way: in this respect, they resemble 
  monks. Finally, the beholder need not be next to their foes in order 
  to attack with melee. They may gaze at distant monsters, though the 
  range of their gaze is somewhat restricted.

</font><font color="#c00000">Dragon
<a name="Dragon"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Dragon
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Dragons are powerful winged serpents. They are the strongest fighters 
  with razor sharp claws and a bone crushing bite. Each dragon has a 
  unique type of breath that becomes more deadly as the dragon grows 
  and matures.
   
  Due to their non-humanoid bodies, dragons are unable to wear armor, 
  gloves or boots. However, being creatures of magic, they are able to 
  wear 6 rings. They can also wear a helmet, a light source, a cloak 
  and an amulet. Because of these equipment restrictions, dragons may 
  have a difficult time covering all resistances despite the fact that 
  each dragon has one or more innate resistances (or even immunities).
   
  Dragons begin life in a weak form, being very young. As their bodies 
  mature, their scales grow tough and their claws sharp. Their breath 
  grows more deadly and they frequently gain additional magical powers 
  and resistances. All dragons can fly, but younger dragons are not so 
  quick as their elders.
   
  Dragons are magical creatures, and each dragon may choose to 
  specialize in a specific type of magic. This magic does not require 
  books to learn and also has a direct influence on the dragon's stats 
  and skills.

</font><font color="#c00000">Elemental/Vortex
<a name="Elemental"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Elemental
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Elementals are mindless creatures animated from a single elemental 
  form. As a species, elementals can never be cut, and they are immune 
  to the eldritch horror (being virtually mindless). They rarely feel 
  fear and are resistant to confusion and poison. In addition, they 
  gain specific powers and abilities depending on their form.
   
  For example, Earth Elementals are slow but gain bonuses to AC due to 
  their tough skins. They are resistant to shards and may even turn 
  their skins to stone. At home in elemental earth, they may travel 
  freely through rocky confines. However, being made of earth, their 
  potions frequently turn to mud!
   
  Air Elementals are shockingly fast, but perhaps that is just the 
  crackle of their electrified bodies? They may hurl bolts and balls 
  electricity at their enemies and may even imbue their weapons with 
  deadly lightning. However, being surrounded by lightning, rings, 
  amulets, wands and rods are quickly destroyed!
   
  Fire Elementals are somewhat fast (They definitely run circles around 
  their earthen brethren) and are cloaked in fire. Of course, they may 
  attack with hell's fury but need to be on the lookout for cold 
  wielding foes. However, being surrounded by fire, scrolls and staves 
  are rapidly burned to ash!
   
  Finally, there are the Water Elementals, creatures able to conjure 
  deadly water bolts. They are immune to stunning. Their attacks can be 
  quite corrosive, but, alas, sometimes their armor corrodes as well! 
  They also have a unique energy system based on the speed of their 
  internal water flow; fighting and the use of elemental powers excite 
  them and turn them into a raging torrent, while resting or aimlessly 
  splashing about slows them down again. High flow rates make water 
  elementals stronger, but their armor sometimes gets caught in the 
  flow and slips off!

<a name="Vortex"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Vortex
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Vortices are mindless whirlwinds of elemental forces randomly moving 
  about the dungeon in search of prey. They are seldom confused and 
  never blinded since they lack vision in the normal sense. Indeed, 
  they seem to be aware of their surroundings even without eyes and 
  need not wear a light source. They can be neither stunned, nor cut, 
  and their mindless nature renders them immune to fear. But, alas, 
  they are hopeless with magical devices, are rather weak in melee, 
  and, while they may breathe almost effortlessly, their breath attacks 
  are rather weak.
   
  Vortices do not have normal bodies. Rather they are simply a rapidly 
  spinning elemental mass, and as such, they may incorporate objects 
  into their rotating essence, gaining bonuses and protection in the 
  process. The number of objects they may use increases with level, and 
  there are no restrictions on the types of equipment they may 'wield' 
  in each slot. While they may 'wield' weapons this way, they cannot 
  attack with them. Instead, the vortex may engulf nearby monsters with 
  their elemental essence.
   
  Vortices evolve randomly, though all seem to end up with the

  </font><font color="#ffffff">Golems are creatures animated by powerful magics: living stone 
  conjured to serve their creators. But you have broken loose and are 
  running amok!
   
  Golems are very slow when it comes to moving about, but this slowness 
  does not affect their non-movement actions. Except for melee, where 
  they are limited to just a single (but mighty) blow. They fight best 
  with their powerful fists. Golems have a very high armor class, 
  possess good resistances and saving throws, and are very strong in 
  melee. They are also resistant to magic, and become more resistant as 
  they evolve. This resistance is quite powerful, reducing the damage 
  taken from all magical attacks.
   
  There are several varieties of golem, all sharing a common 
  evolutionary heritage. First there is the mighty Colossus, the 
  biggest (and slowest) of their kind. Next is the Sky Golem, a 
  creature of powerful magic, resistant to the ravages of time. 
  Finally, there is the Spellwarp Automaton, a creature of utter 
  destruction, almost completely immune to magic. This last form takes 
  nearly forever to build, unfortunately.

</font><font color="#c00000">Jelly
<a name="Jelly"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Jelly
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Jellies are acidic creatures, quietly patrolling their surroundings 
  in search of objects to absorb. They are quite stealthy for most of 
  their lives. They don't wear equipment on their bodies the way normal 
  races do. Instead, they are capable of absorbing objects into their 
  gelatinous frames. In fact, each equipment slot (except their 
  pseudopod) is capable of holding any type of equipment whatsoever, 
  and the number of slots increases with experience. For attacking, 
  jellies are capable of forming a single pseudopod which they may 
  either use for grasping a normal melee weapon, or leave empty to use 
  their innate acid based attacks.
   
  Jellies are monsters and cannot pick a normal player class. Rather 
  than relying on sight, jellies use a little understood sense of their 
  surroundings which allows them to see in the dark with neither light 
  nor infravision. So while jellies can equip a torch or lantern, there 
  is little reason for them to do so.
   
  Jellies feed off the objects they find gaining nutrition in 
  proportion to the weight of the object absorbed. They can eat rations 
  of food if desired, but these are so light as to offer very little 
  nutritional value. Jellies prefer to eat heavy armors and weapons. 
  For convenience, destroying an object ('k' or the autodestroyer) 
  automatically eats the object, and jellies never become bloated, 
  their appetite being insatiable.
   
  Like all monster races, jellies begin as a weak monster of their race 
  and evolve to better forms as they gain experience. Jellies begin 
  life as a small puddle of black ooze with very little carrying 
  capacity for equipment. However, they quickly evolve into a 
  Gelatinous Cube and then into an Acidic Cytoplasm. Jellies take one 
  additional powerful evolutionary step late in life.

<a name="Leprechaun"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Leprechaun
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Leprechauns are small, mischevous creatures, always scheming for 
  gold. They are weak, but quick and stealthy. For combat, they prefer 
  not to use weapons at all. Rather, by keeping at least one hand free, 
  they may pilfer objects or gold from their foes and flee to safety, 
  all in a single action. However, they are capable of fighting with 
  normal weapons should the need arise, but one seldom hears of 
  leprechauns inspiring fear in combat!
   
  Leprechauns value riches above all else and even begin the game with 
  their legendary pot of gold. Leprechauns also have the luck of the 
  Irish, and good drops are more common for them. For magic, the 
  leprechaun has a few talents and even a bit of cursing offense 
  (Malicious and Death Leprechauns are vile, evil creatures, after 
  all). They are masters of teleportation and detection. And while one 
  never fears their combat (though one despises their thievery, of 
  course), they are great masters of bow and device alike. At high 
  levels, they move with incredible speed and seem to be in multiple 
  places at once. Dexterity determines the leprechaun's skill with 
  their magic.
   
  The leprechaun uses gold for spell casting the way other players use 
  mana. Gold is also used to pay for recharging devices or to power 
  mana branded weapons. In addition, increasing the amount of gold on 
  hand increases the power of the leprechaun, granting extra blows per 
  round, extra shots per round, increased AC, life rating and even 
  increasing their power with magical devices. To succeed in life, 
  greed is obviously the primary virtue of the leprechaun!

<a name="Mimic"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Mimic
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Mimics are similar to possessors but instead of controlling the 
  corpses of the vanquished, the mimic imitates those about them. This 
  allows the mimic to assume the forms of foes they have yet to conquer 
  and is quite useful. However, there is a small catch: The mimic can 
  only copy what they see! This limitation forces the mimic to change 
  forms much more often than the possessor would as knowledge of their 
  current body rapidly fades when the original is no longer about. 
  Occasionally, the mimic is able to memorize a particular form well 
  enough to use it again without the original body to imitate, though 
  this does not happen very often and the mimic can only memorize a 
  small number of forms. To have a chance of this, the mimic must be in 
  the desired form when slaying the original.
   
  Mimics are monsters and do not choose a normal class. Their stats, 
  skills, resistances and spells are determined by the form they 
  assume. Their current body also determines their spell stat (e.g. a 
  novice priest uses wisdom, a novice mage uses intelligence). Their 
  current body may offer innate powers (e.g. breath weapons or rockets) 
  in addition to or in lieu of magical powers (e.g. mana storms and 
  frost bolts). Be sure to check both the racial power command ('U') 
  and the magic command ('m') after assuming a new body.

<a name="Possessor"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Possessor
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The Possessor is an odd creature, completely harmless in its natural 
  form. However, they are capable of possessing the corpses of monsters 
  they have slain, and gain powers and abilities based on their current 
  body. As such, they can become quite powerful indeed! Unfortunately, 
  not every type of monster will drop a corpse, and getting suitable 
  corspes to inhabit can be difficult. If the possessor ever leaves 
  their current body then all of their equipment will be removed 
  (except a light source) and they will temporarily be in their native, 
  vulnerable state. Finally, leaving their current body will destroy 
  that corpse most of the time, so the possessor should only do so if 
  they have a better corpse on hand (and also only if there are no 
  monsters nearby!).
   
  Possessors are monsters and do not choose a normal class. Their 
  stats, skills, resistances and spells are completely determined by 
  the body they inhabit. Their current body also determines their spell 
  stat (e.g. a novice priest uses wisdom, a novice mage uses 
  intelligence). Their current body may offer innate powers (e.g. 
  breath weapons or rockets) in addition to or in lieu of magical 
  powers (e.g. mana storms and frost bolts). Be sure to check both the 
  racial power command ('U') and the magic command ('m') after 
  possessing a new body.

  </font><font color="#ffffff">Rings are sentient creatures animated by magical means.
   
  Rings cannot wear normal equipment. Rather, they simply are a ring, 
  magically enchanted. They gain resistances, attributes and spells by 
  absorbing the magic from jewelry they find (rings or amulets).
   
  Rings also have a small arsenal of innate spells. Since the ring is 
  unable to move on its own it will need to lure a nearby monster into 
  wearing it. Magic rings tend to corrupt their owners, and over time, 
  the ring-bearer will find that his will is not his own!
   
  Rings have no physical attacks. Instead, they may blast enemies with 
  mighty spells (once learned, of course). Or, they may simply lie back 
  and let their current bearer do the fighting for them.

  extra resistance, elementals slays and even elemental attacks of 
  their respective element. Titans are powerful immortal beings of 
  legend. Their attacks often confuse their foes and they rarely fight 
  alone.
   
  Giants are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. Instead, they 
  must rely on their superior physical stature to pummel their 
  opponents with mighty blows. Against a distant foe, giants are 
  capable of hurling large boulders with devastating effect.
   
  Giants use the same equipment slots as normal player races and have 
  no innate attacks.

<a name="Orc"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Orc
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Orcs are Morgoth's creation and the backbone of his armies. They are 
  accustomed to caves and tunnels, and resist darkness but tend to be 
  vulnerable to light. Orcs are ugly, brutish pillagers by reputation 
  and should not expect much love from shopkeepers. Morgoth's spirit 
  lives in orcs and drives them forward, making them hard to frighten. 
  What orcs lack in stealth and subtlety they make up for with their 
  sheer brute strength, and generally have little trouble brushing 
  aside weak enemies like kobolds; yet in the deep dungeons, where the 
  strongest fighters and most powerful magicians reside, orcs are 
  rarely seen.

<a name="Lich"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Lich
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Liches are the undead forms of former sorcerers. Their magic is 
  strong but their fighting is weak. As undead, they quickly gain 
  resistance to cold, poison and nether, and these resistances increase 
  as the lich evolves.
   
  Liches are monsters and cannot choose a normal class. Instead, they 
  are born with magical powers and gain additional powers as they 
  advance. Of all the monster races, none can surpass the firepower of 
  an Archlich, but managing to evolve that far can be a challenge. 
  Intelligence is the primary spell stat.
   
  Liches are humanoid so use the standard set of equipment items. 
  Should they forgo the use of a normal weapon, they may touch their 
  opponents for various powerful effects. However, melee is not the 
  strong suit of the Lich and even their deadly touch is often not 
  enough.

<a name="Vampire"></a>  </font><font color="#ff8000">Vampire
  </font><font color="#ffffff">One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an awe-inspiring 
  sight. Yet this dread creature has a serious weakness: the bright 
  rays of sun are its bane, and it will need to flee the surface to the 
  deep recesses of earth until the sun finally sets. Darkness, on the 
  other hand, (eventually) only makes the Vampire stronger. As undead, 
  the Vampire has a firm hold on its life force, and resists nether 
  attacks. The Vampire also resists cold and poison based attacks. It 
  is, however, susceptible to its perpetual hunger for fresh blood, 
  which can only be satiated by sucking the blood from a nearby 
  monster.
   
  The Vampire is a monster race and cannot choose a normal class. 
  Instead, the vampire gains access to various dark powers as they 
  evolve. Of course, they gain a vampiric bite at a very early stage, 
  as they must use this power to feed on the living. Killing humans 
  with this power also is a means of perpetuating the vampire species, 
  and many are the servants of true prince of darkness! Vampires are 
  also rumored to have limited shapeshifting abilities and a powerful, 
  hypnotic gaze.

  </font><font color="#ffffff">Xorn are huge creatures of the element earth. They begin life as an 
  Umber Hulk which is a bizarre creature with glaring eyes capable of 
  confusing their foes, and large mandibles capable of slicing through 
  rock. At this stage in their evolution, their body is vaguely 
  humanoid allowing them to wear a helmet, an amulet, a cloak and even 
  a pair of boots. However, once the Umber Hulk evolves it can no 
  longer wear these items. Instead, it can use its four massive arms 
  for weapons, shields, rings and gloves. At this stage, the Xorn can 
  pass effortlessly through rock.
   
  Xorns are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. They have no 
  active powers but instead rely on their ability to hide in rocks 
  combined with their ability to attack with up to four weapons. They 
  play like warriors and are strong as such.
