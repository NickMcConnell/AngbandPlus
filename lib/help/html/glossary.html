<font color="#00ffff">The FrogComposband Glossary

</font><font color="#ffffff">While playing FrogComposband, discussing it with other players, or even 
just reading the help files, you are likely to run into many esoteric 
game concepts, mysterious abbreviations, or words that have specific 
meanings within the game. It is by no means necessary for a new player 
to read this file before starting play - most players can (and do) just 
figure things out as they go along, the glossary includes many advanced 
topics in addition to the basics, and all the important concepts are 
also covered elsewhere in the help. But you can refer to this list as a 
quick cheat-sheet if you are unsure about a particular word or game 
concept, or just read the whole thing for your amusement :)

See <a href="objects.html#InscriptionAbbrev"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for item attribute abbreviations.
