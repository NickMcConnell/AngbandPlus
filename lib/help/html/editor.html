<font color="#00c8ff">The Mogaminator

</font><font color="#ff4040">The Mogaminator </font><font color="#ffffff">is a rule based system for managing objects 
automatically. With this system, you can decide which objects to 
pickup, which to destroy, which to automatically identify, and which to 
display in the special full screen map. You can automatically inscribe 
certain objects to suit your tastes (for example, spellbooks or magical 
devices) and even enter conditional statements to handle the 
preferences of different classes.

This document describes this system in tutorial fashion, assuming you 
know nothing about it. Detailed reference material will appear towards 
the bottom of this document (see <a href="editor.html#Reference"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">if you really cannot wait!).

    </font><font color="#00ff00">This system is named after its original author. I got 
    rather tired of calling it the </font><font color="#ff4040">Automatic Pickup and 
    Destruction Preferences</font><font color="#00ff00">, which is not only a lot to 
    type, but sounds rather stuffy and boring as well. 
    Also, it was sometimes called </font><font color="#ff4040">The Auto-Destroyer</font><font color="#00ff00">, but, 
    as you are about to learn, automatic destruction is 
    only part of the story.

<a name="Review"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Review of Object Knowledge
</font><font color="#ffffff">There is no doubt about it: The game generates lots and lots of 
objects. Some are valuable and some are not. And what you consider 
worthy will even change based on your character's class and progress. 
Dealing with objects, especially later in the game, can become a bit of 
a nuisance. Fortunately, there are ways to handle the mountains of 
stuff that your character is likely to encounter.

First, let's do a quick review. When you find an object, it will 
generally be unidentified. You might know the basic kind of object it 
is (e.g. a sword), and perhaps its damage dice (if it is a weapon) or 
its base AC (if it is armor), but not much else. Carry the object 
around a bit in your pack, and you might eventually get a sense of the 
quality of the object: whether it is good, or excellent or even 
special, or just average or perhaps even terrible. Details depend on 
your class and this is called </font><font color="#ff4040">pseudo-id</font><font color="#ffffff">. See <a href="objects.html#PseudoID"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more information. 
If you are impatient, you can </font><font color="#ff4040">identify </font><font color="#ffffff">the object right away, provided 
you have a means to do so (spell, scroll or magical device). 
Identification tells you a little more about the object, including its 
obvious magical bonuses and its ego type or artifact name, should you 
be so lucky to find an excellent or special item. But Identify 
generally won't tell you everything about the object. You might need to 
</font><font color="#ff4040">*Identify* </font><font color="#ffffff">it as well to learn about all its attributes.

To recap: your knowledge of an object is in one of the following 
states:
  [1] Unknown
  [2] Pseudo-Identified
  [3] Identified
  [4] *Identified

Since Identify and *Identify* are scarce resources, you will need to 
excercise some restraint when using them. Actually, Identify is rather 
common and it is only *Identify* you really need to worry about, at 
least once you reach the middle part of the game.

For mushrooms, potions and scrolls, things are a little different. 
These objects come in </font><font color="#ff4040">flavors</font><font color="#ffffff">, and once you have learned the flavor, 
you will immediately recognize all future instances of that object. 
Indeed, all instances of the object are exactly alike, so the 
identification game is simply to discover and know the first instance 
of the object, and then decide, via your pickup and destroy 
preferences, what to do with future instances of this type of object. 
For these objects, Identify usually suffices.

For excellent objects, you also need to learn about the ego type 
itself. For example, the first time you encounter a (Pattern) weapon, 
your character will have no knowledge of its basic attributes. Once you 
*Identify* an instance of this ego, you become aware of future 
instances of this ego, just like with flavors of potions and scrolls. 
This will allow you to cut back on your use of *Identify*, but realize 
that many ego types also have some random bonuses in addition to their 
fixed attributes. When you learn an ego type, it is only the fixed 
attributes that you become aware of.

<a name="ManagingObjects"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Managing Objects

</font><font color="#ffffff">So, how do you manage this? Well, you can certainly manage things 
manually, dealing with each object in isolation as you encounter it. 
For the early game, this is doable. But the first time you </font><font color="#ff9200">Ctrl+Arrow 
</font><font color="#ffffff">through a horde orcs or trolls, you will find this approach tedious. At 
this point, I recommend you bite the bullet and enable </font><font color="#ff4040">The Mogaminator</font><font color="#ffffff">. 
It is worth learning about if you plan on playing this variant for any 
length of time. There is also an </font><font color="#ff4040">Easy Destroyer </font><font color="#ffffff">approach to managing 
objects, but I'd prefer you not use it. The choice is yours, though, 
but one caution: Decide which system you are going to use and only use 
that system. In other words, if you turn The Mogaminator on, then turn 
off the Easy Destroyer, and vice versa. If you leave both systems on, 
then there are precedence issues (one system might destroy what is 
marked as desirable via the other system) and it can be hard to track 
down why some undesirable event is happening.

What is </font><font color="#ff4040">The Mogaminator</font><font color="#ffffff">? Basically, it is a rule based system for 
taking a given action each time you encounter a certain type of object. 
The default action is pickup, and this action is used whenever you fail 
to specify an alternative action. But you will also want to learn about 
destroying objects too, since much of what you find will be </font><font color="#ff4040">junk</font><font color="#ffffff">. Let's 
discuss the basics.

<a name="BasicUsage"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Basic Usage

</font><font color="#ffffff">In this section, I'll describe using </font><font color="#ff4040">The Mogaminator </font><font color="#ffffff">without knowing 
anything at all about it. So, I am assuming you are a new player. 
Please don't take offense :)

You turn on this system by pressing </font><font color="#ff9200">_</font><font color="#ffffff">, which also brings up an in-game 
editor where you can manage your preferences. It might look something 
like:

</font><font color="#00c8ff">(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&amp;Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)         </font><font color="#ffffff">(0,10)

</font><font color="#ffffff">Pickup and inscribe "!E" on all items which have "mushroom of restoring" as part
of its name.  Display these items when you press the M key in the full 'M'ap.


Since you are new, you probably want to run from this complexity as 
fast as you can. Notice the top line of the screen where it tells you 
how to get out: </font><font color="#ff9200">^Q</font><font color="#ffffff">. That's fine and we'll discuss this file in detail, 
including its format and what each line means later on below. The 
important thing is that the first time you press </font><font color="#ff9200">_ </font><font color="#ffffff">turns this system 
on, and initializes it with some pretty nice default preferences.

Now, you will find much of the junk you encounter being destroyed. For 
example, all those corpses and skeletons that you are leaving behind as 
you hack and slash your way through the dungeon. That in itself is 
rather nice. But, you will still run into objects you consider useless. 
For example, suppose you took that all important first step on the road 
to slaying Morgoth, and bought a lantern at the General Store. Now, you 
don't really care about torches anymore. Use the </font><font color="#ff9200">k </font><font color="#ffffff">command (or </font><font color="#ff9200">^D </font><font color="#ffffff">for 
the Roguelike keyset) and you get a prompt like:
  Really destroy </font><font color="#fffd00">Wooden Torches {unidentified}</font><font color="#ffffff">? </font><font color="#fffd00">[y/n/Auto]

</font><font color="#ffffff">Notice the </font><font color="#ff9200">A</font><font color="#ffffff">uto option. Choose that and you get a message that the 
object is destroyed, but the fact that you don't like torches is 
remembered by the system. The next time your character moves on top of 
one, it will automatically be destroyed.

And that is basically it. Keep registering stuff for automatic 
destruction as you encounter it, and you'll find objects becoming much 
easier to manage.

<a name="CorrectingMistakes"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Correcting Mistakes

</font><font color="#ffffff">"Awesome! But what if I make a mistake and auto-register rings of 
speed?" Well, don't panic. You can easily fix things up, but doing so 
will require you to go back to the preference file editor. Press </font><font color="#ff9200">_ </font><font color="#ffffff">and 
then press </font><font color="#ff9200">END </font><font color="#ffffff">to move to the end of the document. This is where the 
game keeps track of any objects that you automatically register for 
destruction during the Destroy Object command. Your screen might look 
something like:

</font><font color="#00c8ff">(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&amp;Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)         </font><font color="#ffffff">(0,199)

</font><font color="#ffffff">Destroy unidentified light sources whose name is beginning with "wooden torch$".

You cannot tell from the picture above, but I placed the cursor on the 
very last line of the file. In my case, this is the line from when I 
auto-registered torches for destruction. Notice that at the very bottom 
of the screen, the game tells you exactly what each line means, and 
what will happen for the given rule. If you are curious, you can move 
the cursor around the default preference file and actually learn quite 
a bit about how the system works. For now, though, if you wish to undo 
any rules that you automatically added, simply delete the corresponding 
line from this file and then exit with the </font><font color="#ff9200">^W </font><font color="#ffffff">option to save and apply 
your changes.

<a name="WantedObjects"></a></font><font color="#c00000">What About Stuff I Want?

</font><font color="#ffffff">That's correct: What you don't want is only half the story. Some 
objects you really, really want, such as stat potions and 5d5 long 
swords. Wouldn't it be nice if the game automatically picked these 
objects up for you whenever you encountered them? Or, even better, what 
if the game showed them to you in the Object List command and the Full 
Map Display? Then, assuming your detection was good, you could quickly 
see what worthy objects might be laying about on the current level.

Well, you can do all these things. At the moment, we still don't know 
anything about what those lines in the editor mean, but we have a vague 
notion that each line represents a single rule somehow. We also know 
that the auto-destroy lines from the Destroy Object command are being 
added to the bottom and are being displayed in a funny color. 
Generally, those lines are hands off: The game manages them for you, 
though, as we just saw above, it's fine to go ahead and delete them if 
you made a mistake with the auto-register option. And, we saw that the 
game comes with lots of rules already set up for you. You can ignore 
those for the time being, though you can also learn a bit by moving the 
cursor around in the default file and reading the detailed explanation 
at the bottom.

This is great, but let's say you really want a particular object. 
Suppose you want potions of Cure Critical Wounds (I'm trying to think 
of an example that isn't set in the default preferences). It's early in 
the game, and you find yourself getting hurt quite often. Wouldn't it 
be nice to be able to automatically display these potions? Well, you 
can easily do so by adding the following line to the top of the file:

</font><font color="#00c8ff">(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&amp;Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)       </font><font color="#fffd00">* </font><font color="#ffffff">(0,5)-(20,5)

Here, you can see there is some sort of wanted potion in the Full 
Screen Map (</font><font color="#ff9200">M</font><font color="#ffffff">), though, unfortunately, you can tell what. Let's try the 
Object List (</font><font color="#ff9200">]</font><font color="#ffffff">) instead:

There are 7 wanted objects:                       </font><font color="#00ff00">################# </font><font color="#ffffff">LEVEL      </font><font color="#00ff00">1

</font><font color="#ffffff">Bingo! You can even automatically travel to those delicious potions by 
pressing </font><font color="#ff9200">` </font><font color="#ffffff">inside the Object List. What could be easier? With features 
like these, why isn't </font><font color="#ff4040">The Serpent of Chaos </font><font color="#ffffff">dead already?

To recap, adding the line "Cure Critical Wounds" means to automatically 
pick up any object having "Cure Critical Wounds" as part of its name. 
You don't have to type so much: "Crit" might work just as well. But the 
less you type, the more likely it is that your new rule will match 
other objects. For example, "Cure" would match potions of Cure Light 
Wounds, Cure Serious Wounds and Cure Critical Wounds. It might also 
pick up some magical devices that have some sort of Cure effect. 
Sometimes this is OK and even desirable. Other times, it behooves you 
to type more.

<a name="IntroRulesEvents"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Introduction to Rules and Events

</font><font color="#ffffff">Let's begin to learn what is going on. Basically, the preference file 
is an ordered list of rules. Whenever a certain event happens, such as 
moving on top of an object, the rules are scanned, in order, and the 
first one that matches, if any, is applied. Every rule has an action 
associate with it that determines what to do whenever this rule 
matches.

It is very important to keep in mind that order matters, and that it is 
the </font><font color="#a500ff">first </font><font color="#ffffff">matching rule that gets used. Often times, you might add a 
line to do something really important, but place it too low in the file 
so that it never gets used in practice. The default preference file is 
very careful about the ordering of the rules it adds. With time and 
practice, you will be too! If you are adding a rule to automatically 
pickup a new kind of object, like we did with "Cure Critical Wounds" in 
the previous section, simply add it to the very top of the file. With 
that approach, you generally won't go wrong.

The second point was that each rule is a single line in the file. You 
probably noticed that not every line in the file corresponds to a rule, 
though. There are comments and blank lines, for example. There are also 
conditional tests, but we won't discuss those just now. Comments begin 
with a </font><font color="#ff9200"># </font><font color="#ffffff">key and are ignored by the system. They are displayed in 
</font><font color="#00ff00">green</font><font color="#ffffff">. The syntax of a rule is discussed in the next section.

The final point was the notion of an event, or a point in time when the 
game will attempt to apply a rule. In general, this happens whenever 
(1) the player moves on top of an object, (2) gets a pseudo-id for an 
object (see <a href="option.html#destroy_feeling"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">) and (3) identifies an object (see <a href="option.html#destroy_identify"></font><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).

<a name="Rules"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Rules

</font><font color="#ffffff">A rule is a single line that consists of an action to perform, a 
predicate to test matches, and an optional inscription to add. Let's 
discuss each of these in turn.

  </font><font color="#ff9200">Actions
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">First of all, picking something up is the default action and is 
  inferred whenever you fail to specify an alternative. What are the 
  alternatives?
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">!  </font><font color="#ffffff">Destroy
  </font><font color="#ff9200">;  </font><font color="#ffffff">Prompt to Pickup
  </font><font color="#ff9200">~  </font><font color="#ffffff">Leave on the Floor
  
  These are the primary actions. Pickup is assumed if you fail to type 
  </font><font color="#ff9200">!</font><font color="#ffffff">,</font><font color="#ff9200">; </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff9200">~</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  In addition there are the following command letters that augment the 
  primary action.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">(  </font><font color="#ffffff">Don't display this item in the Full Map
  </font><font color="#ff9200">?  </font><font color="#ffffff">Automatically Identify this item
  
  The first one is not commonly used. Later in the game, your character 
  might have the power to map the entire level at once. If there is a 
  vault on the level, then many, many objects may match your pickup 
  rules. Were they all to be displayed in the Full Map view, there 
  would not be room to see them all, which can be annoying when that 
  5d5 long sword is not displayed but the potion of curing is. You'd 
  really, really prefer to hear about that sword! With the </font><font color="#ff9200">( </font><font color="#ffffff">option, 
  you will still automatically pickup the matching object, it's just 
  that you won't get a text indicator in the Full Map screen. (But you 
  should probably use the Object List command too, since it shows all 
  matching objects in a scrollable list, sorted by object value).
  
  The second additional option (viz., </font><font color="#ff9200">?</font><font color="#ffffff">) is very useful, since it 
  automatically identifies the matching object. This is a </font><font color="#a500ff">*HUGE* 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">timesaver ... when it works! But to work, you need to have either 
  scrolls or a device with the identify power. Spell casters are 
  currently out of luck :(
  
  All of the action command letters must be specified first in the line 
  for the rule, with one exception. The </font><font color="#ff9200"># </font><font color="#ffffff">letter indicates that you 
  wish to automatically inscribe matching objects, and it must occur at 
  the end of the rule, followed by the text to use for the actual 
  inscription. For example, </font><font color="#ffcc80">#@ad!s!d!k </font><font color="#ffffff">at the end of a rule will 
  automatically inscribe </font><font color="#ff4040">@ad!s!d!k </font><font color="#ffffff">to any object matching the rule. If 
  you don't know what this inscription means, it is not really 
  important. You can see <a href="objects.html#Inscriptions"></font><font color="#00ff00">[e]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for information about inscriptions.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Matching
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Matching is the most important part of a rule. We saw above that 
  matching is by string comparison with the object name, but you can be 
  more specific than that if you want. To do so, use the following 
  keywords to construct a predicate used to test objects. The keyword 
  portion of the match consists of zero or more adjectives modifying a 
  noun that indicates the broad class of objects which should be 
  considered. In addition, you can specify a free form text comparison 
  string by adjoining </font><font color="#ff9200">: </font><font color="#ffffff">followed by text to search for. We'll put all 
  of this together in the examples section below.
  
  Let's do nouns first. A complete list is presented at the end of this 
  document, but some common nouns to get us started include:
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Items     </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to everything. This is useful for very general 
            rules, such as ~?</font><font color="#00ff00">Unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">to automatically 
            identify, but leave on the ground, everything not yet 
            identified.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons   </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all melees weapons, but not to missile weapons.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters  </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all missile weapons, including bows, slings and 
            crossbows.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Armors    </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all forms of armor, including shields, helms, 
            cloaks as well as body armor.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Wands     </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to magical devices that are wands
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Staves    </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to magical devices that are staves
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Rods      </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to magical devices that are rods
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Potions   </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to potions
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Scrolls   </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to scrolls
  
  If you are using keywords to build a match predicate, then you must 
  specify exactly one noun. But you may use as many adjectives as you 
  like. The complete list of adjectives is given in the reference 
  section of this document, but here are some of the more common ones:
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Unaware      </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to objects that the player is unaware of. In 
               practice, this currently only includes mushrooms, 
               potions and scrolls that the player has not yet 
               encountered.
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Unidentified </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to objects that have not yet been identified.
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Ego          </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all excellent objects.
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Dice Boosted </font><font color="#ffffff">When used with </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters</font><font color="#ffffff">, this adjective 
               indicates that the object has higher damage dice than 
               usual. Archers in particular should be on the lookout 
               for </font><font color="#00ff00">Dice Boosted </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters</font><font color="#ffffff">!
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Wanted       </font><font color="#ffffff">Combine with </font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Skeletons </font><font color="#ffffff">to indicated that the 
               corpse or skeleton belongs to a wanted monster. These 
               may be turned in at the Hunter's Office for a prize.
  
  As an example of using multiple adjectives, the phrase </font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified 
  ego </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">applies to, well, all melee weapons that are both 
  excellent and not yet identified. Of course this means that you must 
  have gotten a psuedo-id on the object in order to be aware that the 
  object is excellent, since it is not yet identified. Still, this is a 
  very useful phrase when combined with the </font><font color="#ff9200">? </font><font color="#ffffff">command letter!
  
  Finally, use a search string to further refine the match. If you 
  don't use any adjective or noun keywords, then the entire text of 
  your rule (starting after any command letters, and including all text 
  up to the </font><font color="#ff9200"># </font><font color="#ffffff">inscription character) is used as the search string. If 
  you are using keywords, then you will need to mark the end of the 
  keyword section with the </font><font color="#ff9200">: </font><font color="#ffffff">separator letter. Examples are discussed 
  below.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Examples
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">There will be a quiz on this later, so make sure you understand the 
  following examples!
  
  !</font><font color="#ff4040">potions</font><font color="#ffffff">:apple juice
    Destroy potions of apple juice (Who would want those?). It uses the 
    </font><font color="#ff9200">! </font><font color="#ffffff">command letter for destruction, the </font><font color="#ff4040">potions </font><font color="#ffffff">keyword to apply to 
    an entire class of objects, the </font><font color="#ff9200">: </font><font color="#ffffff">separator key, and an arbitrary 
    text field to use for a string match against the object name.
  
  ?</font><font color="#00ff00">unaware </font><font color="#ff4040">items
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Pickup and automatically identify unaware items (e.g. a potion 
    you've never seen before). Note that the pickup action is implied 
    since none of the other primary actions are indicated, and even 
    though there is a secondary action (to auto-id). This command uses 
    the adjective </font><font color="#00ff00">unaware </font><font color="#ffffff">to modify the noun </font><font color="#ff4040">items</font><font color="#ffffff">. You could narrow 
    down the applicability of this rule by using a more specific noun, 
    such as </font><font color="#ff4040">rings </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">potions</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">wanted </font><font color="#ff4040">corpses</font><font color="#ffcc80">#Wanted!k!k!k
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Pickup wanted corpses. These are corpses that you may turn in at 
    the Hunter's Office for a prize. Automatically inscribe these 
    objects with </font><font color="#ffcc80">Wanted!k!k!k</font><font color="#ffffff">. If you don't know what !k means, see <a href="objects.html#Inscriptions"></font><font color="#00ff00">[f]</a> 
    </font><font color="#ffffff">(OK, it means to prompt the user when using the </font><font color="#ff9200">k </font><font color="#ffffff">command to 
    destroy objects. So, if you are paranoid and don't want to destroy 
    something by mistake, you inscribe !k on it. In this case, whoever 
    wrote this rule was </font><font color="#a500ff">really </font><font color="#ffffff">paranoid, since you will be prompted 
    three times to confirm destruction!).
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">potions</font><font color="#ffffff">:resistance</font><font color="#ffcc80">#!k!q
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Pickup all potions whose name contains the word "resistance". 
    Automatically inscribe </font><font color="#ff4040">!k!q </font><font color="#ffffff">on these objects. In effect, this rule 
    matches potions of resistance, but rather than using a string match 
    of "potion of resistance" on all items, it uses a string match of 
    "resistance" only on potions. Either approach would work equally 
    well in this instance, but sometimes it is better to use the 
    appropriate noun for the match, especially if you are dealing with 
    objects that might come as ego items, as the next example 
    indicates. Also, if you string match using "potions of resistance" 
    by mistake, your rule will not work. Why it fails is left as an 
    exercise for the reader!
  
  ?</font><font color="#ff4040">staves</font><font color="#ffffff">:destruction</font><font color="#ffcc80">#@ud!s!d!k
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Pickup and automatically identify all staves whose name contains 
    the word "destruction". Inscribe these objects with </font><font color="#ffcc80">@ud!s!d!k </font><font color="#ffffff">as 
    well. Note that using the noun </font><font color="#ff4040">staves </font><font color="#ffffff">with a string match on 
    "destruction" works more reliably then a string match on "staff: 
    destruction". Why this is the case will become apparent the first 
    time you find a "staff of power: destruction".
  

<a name="Scenarios"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Scenarios

</font><font color="#ffffff">After that last section, you should have complete mastery over 
individual rules. Now, it is time to step up one level and apply 
multiple rules to accomplish common tasks. Ready?

  </font><font color="#00c8ff">Scenario #1</font><font color="#ffffff">: Handling Objects
  
  In this scenario, you would like to handle the stream of objects in 
  the most efficient way possible. Let's begin with the following 
  rules:
    (</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">armors
    </font><font color="#ffffff">(</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">These rules say to pickup all armor and weapons not yet identified. 
  That leaves out many types of objects, like potions and scrolls, but 
  this scenario is just focusing on objects for which you might receive 
  a pseudo-id. We use the </font><font color="#ff9200">( </font><font color="#ffffff">command letter to prevent the Full Map 
  Screen from filling up with stuff not yet known to be desirable. But 
  the auto-pickup is very nice, since items need to be in your pack for 
  pseudo-id to kick in (until CL35, at least).
  
  Now, lets add the following rules:
    !</font><font color="#00ff00">average common </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons
    </font><font color="#ffffff">!</font><font color="#00ff00">average common </font><font color="#ff4040">armors
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">In practice, we wouldn't want these right away since they say to 
  destroy common stuff. You can handle that with conditionals, which I 
  haven't discussed yet. For the moment, assume your character is 
  advanced enough to not want to keep average equipment. These rules 
  will fire once pseudo-id kicks in, destroying </font><font color="#ff4040">junk</font><font color="#ffffff">. (Of course, junk 
  is relative, and you may want to keep some stuff). The </font><font color="#00ff00">common 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">adjective prevents these rules from applying to rare average items, 
  like dragon scale mail, or blades of chaos.
  
  So, now our character is merrily picking up all equipment and then 
  auto-destroying the average stuff once pseudo-id kicks in. Can we do 
  more? Well, try adding:
    ?</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified ego </font><font color="#ff4040">items
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Now, the egos are automatically being identified on psuedo-id as 
  well. Pretty sweet! Finally, eventually you will learn that some ego 
  types are junk, and perhaps would have auto registered some lines 
  like:
  
    (!</font><font color="#00ff00">common ego </font><font color="#ff4040">cloaks</font><font color="#ffffff">:of protection
    (!</font><font color="#00ff00">common ego </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons</font><font color="#ffffff">:of *slay* orc
    etc.
  
  So that even the junk excellent items are being toasted for you, 
  automatically, with nary a keystroke on your part. But, sometimes 
  egos become dice boosted, and the *slay* orc weapon might mean 
  something to you if it is really powerful. You can protect it with
    </font><font color="#00ff00">dice boosted </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons
  </font><font color="#ffffff">or perhaps even
    </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons </font><font color="#ff9200">more dice than 30
  </font><font color="#ffffff">but that last one is an advanced maneuver.
  
  In summary, the complete order of your rules might be:
    </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons </font><font color="#ff9200">more dice than 30
    </font><font color="#ffffff">?</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified ego </font><font color="#ff4040">items
  
    </font><font color="#ffffff">!</font><font color="#00ff00">average common </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons
    </font><font color="#ffffff">!</font><font color="#00ff00">average common </font><font color="#ff4040">armors
  
    </font><font color="#ffffff">(</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">armors
    </font><font color="#ffffff">(</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons
  
    </font><font color="#ffffff">(!</font><font color="#00ff00">common ego </font><font color="#ff4040">cloaks</font><font color="#ffffff">:of protection
    (!</font><font color="#00ff00">common ego </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons</font><font color="#ffffff">:of *slay* orc
  
  New armors and weapons come down and hit rule 5 or 6 when your 
  character steps on them, so they get placed into your pack 
  automatically (Remember, matching is based on your current knowledge 
  of the object, not what it truly is. So, when you find, say, a dagger 
  (+0, +0), it is not immediately destroyed since it is unidentified 
  and not yet pseudo-identified: You don't yet know it is </font><font color="#00ff00">average</font><font color="#ffffff">!). 
  Eventually, pseudo-id will kick in revealing the object as average, 
  in which case it is destroyed by rule 3 or rule 4, or as excellent, 
  in which case it is processed by rule 2 which auto-identifies the ego 
  item and rescans the rules. If it is a cloak of protection, it is 
  destroyed by rule 7, while if it is a weapon of *slay* orc, it is 
  destroyed by rule 8. Unless it happened to be hugely dice boosted, in 
  which case it got protected by rule 1 (remember, rules are processed 
  in order). Easy, right? What happens to weapons/armors that psuedo-id 
  as {Good}? Or {Special}?
  
  </font><font color="#00c8ff">Scenario #2</font><font color="#ffffff">: Flavored Objects
  This one is easier, and I'll give the full set of rules first:
    </font><font color="#ff4040">potions</font><font color="#ffffff">:healing</font><font color="#ffcc80">#!k!q
    </font><font color="#ff4040">potions</font><font color="#ffffff">:of strength</font><font color="#ffcc80">#!k

    ... &lt;many more junk flavors auto-registered for destruction&gt; ...
  
  Now, the pattern is wanted flavors on top for autopickup (and 
  inscription), unwanted flavors on bottom for autodestruction (these 
  are placed in your file automatically each time you press </font><font color="#ff9200">A </font><font color="#ffffff">while 
  destroying an object) and rules for collecting and unaware items in 
  the middle. Unaware items get automatically identified, at which 
  point one of the pickup or destroy rules might get a chance to act. 
  If this was a new flavor you find useless, destroy it and 
  autoregister it for destruction so you never see it again. As for the 
  </font><font color="#00ff00">collecting </font><font color="#ffffff">rules, those fire if you have another object of the same 
  flavor in your pack. Perhaps you are carrying potions of cure 
  critical wounds but don't have a rule specifically for this flavor. 
  In this case, the collecting rule will pickup these objects for you.
  
  </font><font color="#00c8ff">Scenario #3</font><font color="#ffffff">: Spellbooks
  OK, this is the last one. See if you can figure this one out first:
    </font><font color="#00ff00">first realm's fourth </font><font color="#ff4040">spellbooks</font><font color="#ffcc80">#@md!s!d!k

    </font><font color="#00ff00">fourth </font><font color="#ff4040">spellbooks
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Did you figure it out? This scenario picks up high level spellbooks 
  from your player's realms of magics, leaves low level spellbooks from 
  your player's realms of magics, destroys all other low level 
  spellbooks, destroys all arcane magic spellbooks, but picks up high 
  level spellbooks from other realms (presumably to sell for gold). 
  Spellbooks from the player's realms are auto-inscribed to make 
  casting a spell from the appropriate book consistently use the same 
  letter to choose that book. Here, as elsewhere, order is very 
  important. Rules for the player's spell realms must come before the 
  general rules to destroy low level spellbooks. There is also an 
  </font><font color="#00ff00">unreadable </font><font color="#ffffff">adjective that would have made processing safer, and less 
  order dependant.
  
<a name="WhichRule"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Which Rule is Being Used?

</font><font color="#ffffff">If you are ever unsure about which rule is being applied in a given 
situation, turn on the destroy_debug option (see <a href="option.html#destroy_debug"></font><font color="#00ff00">[g]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">). With this option 
you can use the </font><font color="#ff9200">I</font><font color="#ffffff">nspect command for more information. For example:

  </font><font color="#c86400">a Thieves' Guide [Burglar's Handbook]

    </font><font color="#c00000">Autopick: </font><font color="#ffffff">(!</font><font color="#00ff00">unreadable first </font><font color="#ff4040">spellbooks

  </font><font color="#00c8ff">6 Potions of Resist Cold
    </font><font color="#ffffff">You get temporary resistance to cold when you quaff it. This
    resistance is cumulative with equipment.

    </font><font color="#c00000">Autopick: </font><font color="#ff4040">potions</font><font color="#ffffff">:resist</font><font color="#ffcc80">#!k!q

</font><font color="#ffffff">In the first case, this is a line automatically added when I destroyed 
an unreadable spellbook using the </font><font color="#ff9200">k </font><font color="#ffffff">command. In the second case, this 
is a line that comes as a default setting. I may or may not like this 
behavior, and if I don't, now I know which line to change!

In addition, with debugging turned on, the rules used are printed in 
the message log as actions are taken, so you can see exactly why 
objects are being destroyed, picked up, left on the ground or 
auto-identified. For example:


  You have 26 charges remaining. </font><font color="#00c8ff">(AutoID:</font><font color="#ffffff">~?</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">rods</font><font color="#00c8ff">) </font><font color="#ffffff">You see </font><font color="#a500ff">a

  </font><font color="#ffffff">Auto-destroying.

Also, you might want to check out the </font><font color="#ff9200">~_ </font><font color="#ffffff">Knowledge Option. Like the 
editor, it displays the rules for you in the order they are processed. 
But it only displays the rules that are currently active, which can be 
a useful thing to see if you add a lot of conditional rules.

<a name="Conditionals"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Conditional Rules

</font><font color="#ffffff">This is an advanced topic. If you play a lot, then you probably play 
many different types of characters. You probably have rules for objects 
that you would like to share across all of your characters. While other 
characters, depending on their class, might have special needs. 
Finally, you might have some rules that you use early in the game, and 
others that you would like to turn on towards the end of the game. You 
can accomplish all of this using conditional statements to guard your 
individual rule definitions. The conditions are evaluated each time 
your preference file is loaded to determine which rules to apply. Oh, 
and don't worry, the game automatically reloads the file for you each 
time your player gains an experience level, so your conditions get 
checked automatically without any intervention on your part.

Imagine scanning the entire preference file from top to bottom, 
building a list of all the player's rules. Imagine now that there 
exists a switch that can be turned on and off. If the switch is on, 
then every rule line you read gets added to the list of current rules. 
If the switch is off, then every rule line you read gets skipped. 
Finally, imagine there are lines in the file that can turn this switch 
on and off. If you can imagine all of that, then, aside from the fact 
you are probably a computer programmer, you can understand how 
conditional rules work.

The rule lines have already been discussed, and you are surely a master 
of them by now. So we really only need to consider those lines that can 
flip our global switch. These are called </font><font color="#ff4040">Conditional Lines </font><font color="#ffffff">and they 
always begin with the characters </font><font color="#ff4040">?: </font><font color="#ffffff">followed by a (rather cryptic 
looking) expression.

Let's look at an example. Remember </font><font color="#00c8ff">Scenario #1 </font><font color="#ffffff">above when we added 
lines to destroy average equipment? Well, in practice, you would 
probably want those rules to not be used in the early game. Perhaps 
once your character reaches a certain level, you would want to add 
them. Well, try the following instead:

  </font><font color="#a500ff">?:[GEQ $LEVEL 20]
  </font><font color="#ffffff">!</font><font color="#00ff00">average common </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons
  </font><font color="#ffffff">!</font><font color="#00ff00">average common </font><font color="#ff4040">armors
  </font><font color="#a500ff">?:1

</font><font color="#ffffff">Notice there are two lines colored in </font><font color="#a500ff">violet</font><font color="#ffffff">, each beginning with </font><font color="#ff4040">?:</font><font color="#ffffff">. 
These are the Conditional Lines. The first one executes a funny looking 
expression while the second one is much simpler, albeit just as hard to 
fathom. In programming, one typically uses numbers to represent 
everything, and this case is no different. We represent the state of 
our global switch as a number. When it is 0, the switch is off. When it 
is nonzero, the switch is on. So the first conditional might or might 
not flip the switch. It depends on the value of $LEVEL (which you 
probably guessed is the player's current experience level) and whether 
or not it is &gt;= 20. GEQ stands for greater than or equal to, and 20 is 
just a number. And the expression is presented in a funny order as [GEQ 
$LEVEL 20] rather than $LEVEL GEQ 20 (or even $LEVEL &gt;= 20). You might 
not find this odd, but if that is the case, then you probably (like me) 
enjoy programming in LISP or Scheme. In these languages, functions are 
always expressed as (f x y z) to evaluate the function f with the 
arguments x, y and z. And &gt;= is a function just like any other (it 
returns a number which we think of as a boolean value, being either 
non-zero for TRUE, or zero for FALSE). You can also nest calls. Perhaps 
x must be computed as (g u v) which calls function g with arguments u 
and v. Then, instead of (f x y z) you write (f (g u v) y z). Got it?

Now make those parentheses square as [f [g u v] y z], tag variables 
with a leading $ so our parser can figure things out, rename operators 
with three letter abbreviations, "turn up the volume" making everything 
uppercase, and you will finally understand [GEQ $LEVEL 20].

In contrast, </font><font color="#a500ff">?:1 </font><font color="#ffffff">is easy. Like any good Scheme wannabe, literal values 
are self evaluating. Which is just a fancy way of saying that the value 
of 1 is itself, viz. 1. No confusion. And 1 means true, which means 
turn the switch back on in case the first Conditional Line turned it 
off. And in case it isn't obvious, the switch is always turned on 
before starting the scan, so you don't need a </font><font color="#a500ff">?:1 </font><font color="#ffffff">at the top of the 
file.

Here's another, more complicated example:
  </font><font color="#a500ff">?:[OR [EQU $CLASS Mage High-Mage Sorcerer] [EQU $RACE Beholder Lich] ]
  </font><font color="#ffffff">wizardstaff
  </font><font color="#a500ff">?:1
</font><font color="#ffffff">That's a complicated expression to determine who wants to gather a 
wizardstaff, but I'm willing to bet you can figure it out without 
waiting for my explanation. In words, if the player's class is either a 
Mage, High-Mage or a Sorcerer; </font><font color="#a500ff">or </font><font color="#ffffff">if the player's race is either a 
Beholder or a Lich, then the player wants a wizardstaff (rather badly, 
actually). So we really have the expression (or a b) where a and b are 
computed values using subexpressions to test the player's class or race 
(and you should try playing a Beholder sometime; they are quite fun!).

So, we have expressions composed of functions, variables, literals and 
parentheses. What are the functions and variables we can use?

</font><font color="#00ff00">Function  Explanation
  </font><font color="#ff4040">IOR     </font><font color="#ffffff">Inclusive Or: [IOR a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of </font><font color="#ff9200">any 
          </font><font color="#ffffff">subexpression a, b, c, ... is TRUE.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">OR      </font><font color="#ffffff">Same as IOR. One day I was puzzled why my [OR ...] expression 
          wasn't working. Also, if you are going to have IOR, it 
          suggests you will have XOR (Exclusive Or) as well, and we 
          don't!
  </font><font color="#ff4040">AND     </font><font color="#ffffff">Logical And: [AND a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of </font><font color="#ff9200">all 
          </font><font color="#ffffff">subexpressions a, b, c, ... are TRUE.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">NOT     </font><font color="#ffffff">[NOT a] is TRUE if a is FALSE, and vice versa. Use this when 
          you want to take an action when something is </font><font color="#ff9200">not </font><font color="#ffffff">true.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">EQU     </font><font color="#ffffff">[EQU v a b c ...] is TRUE when the value of v is </font><font color="#ff9200">one </font><font color="#ffffff">of the 
          values a, b, c, ... Comparison is by string. Typically, you 
          use this with v being a built-in variable expression, like 
          </font><font color="#ff4040">$CLASS </font><font color="#ffffff">(see below) and the remaining arguments to EQU being 
          strings to test, like </font><font color="#ff4040">Warrior </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Rogue</font><font color="#ffffff">. Note that string 
          literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain spaces.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">LEQ     </font><font color="#ffffff">[LEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is </font><font color="#ff9200">less than or 
          equal to </font><font color="#ffffff">the integer value of a. Note that while EQU treats 
          its arguments as strings, LEQ treats them as numbers.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">GEQ     </font><font color="#ffffff">[GEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is </font><font color="#ff9200">greater than 
          or equal to </font><font color="#ffffff">the integer value of a. Note that while EQU 
          treats its arguments as strings, GEQ treats them as numbers. 
          For example, use </font><font color="#a500ff">[GEQ $LEVEL 20] </font><font color="#ffffff">to test if the player's 
          current level is greater than, or equal to 20.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Variable  Explanation
</font><font color="#ff4040">$RACE     </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the name of the player's race. For example, </font><font color="#ff4040">Snotling 
          </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">High-Elf</font><font color="#ffffff">.
</font><font color="#ff4040">$CLASS    </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the name of the player's class. For example, 
          </font><font color="#ff4040">Warrior-Mage </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Mindcrafter</font><font color="#ffffff">. Note, if you are playing in 
          </font><font color="#c00000">Monster </font><font color="#ffffff">mode, then this variable always returns </font><font color="#ff4040">Monster</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
          while $RACE returns the actual monster race you are playing, 
          such as </font><font color="#ff4040">Lich </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Dragon</font><font color="#ffffff">.
</font><font color="#ff4040">$REALM1   </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the name of the player's first realm, if any. For 
          example, </font><font color="#ff4040">Chaos </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Sorcery</font><font color="#ffffff">. If the player does not have a 
          first realm, then this variable returns </font><font color="#ff4040">none</font><font color="#ffffff">.
</font><font color="#ff4040">$REALM2   </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the name of the player's second realm, if any. For 
          example, </font><font color="#ff4040">Life </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Death</font><font color="#ffffff">. If the player does not have a second 
          realm, then this variable returns </font><font color="#ff4040">none</font><font color="#ffffff">.
</font><font color="#ff4040">$LEVEL    </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the player's current level. Typically, you combine 
          this with GEQ or LEQ to test the level against a threshold, 
          such as </font><font color="#a500ff">[LEQ $LEVEL 34]</font><font color="#ffffff">.
</font><font color="#ff4040">$MONEY    </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the amount of gold the player has. Like $LEVEL, use 
          this with GEQ or LEQ to test whether your player is rich or 
          poor.

As mentioned before, all variables begin with a </font><font color="#ff9200">$ </font><font color="#ffffff">character to 
distinguish them from string literals.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Literal   Explanation
</font><font color="#ff4040">Number    </font><font color="#ffffff">Numbers are written like </font><font color="#ff4040">105 </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">32</font><font color="#ffffff">.
</font><font color="#ff4040">String    </font><font color="#ffffff">Strings are written like </font><font color="#ff4040">High-Mage </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Beholder</font><font color="#ffffff">. Note that 
          string literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain 
          spaces.

<a name="Editor"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Using the Editor

</font><font color="#ffffff">We've gotten this far, and I bet you've been using the built in 
preference editor just fine. It is pretty easy to use, and you can 
probably figure it out on your own. Like any text editor you have used, 
you move the cursor about with the arrow keys and then type when you 
have located the correct position. Navigation keys like </font><font color="#ff9200">HOME </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#ff9200">END 
</font><font color="#ffffff">might not be standard, since they take you to the top or bottom of the 
document, rather than the beginning or end of the current line, but 
you'll get used to the various quirks.

I really don't feel a need to document the editor at all, since it has 
a complete menu structure which you can browse and learn all the 
commands. Simply press </font><font color="#ff9200">ESC </font><font color="#ffffff">to get started and then follow the various 
options. For example:

Here, you can clearly see what commands to use to move the cursor about 
(And if you are running on the </font><font color="#ff4040">Curses </font><font color="#ffffff">platform, you'll notice that 
arrow keys don't work so you'll need to learn the control key 
alternatives).

One comment I will make on the editor is that it colors each rule line 
according to the syntax of the expression. I personally find this 
rather useful. However, sometimes the text displayed is not the same as 
the rule you actually typed in, even though the meaning is the same. 
For example, if you use multiple adjectives, then they might get 
reordered when they are drawn with syntax coloring. In order to avoid 
confusion, the current line (viz. the line under the cursor) is never 
syntax colored and always displays exactly what you typed.

<a name="Reference"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Reference Tables

</font><font color="#ffffff">This section will give all the nitty gritty syntax details for </font><font color="#ff4040">The 
Mogaminator</font><font color="#ffffff">. But first, where are those preference files located 
anyway? The default preferences are initialized from 
lib/pref/pickpref.prf which is located in your game's directory 
structure. If you don't like the defaults that I have provided and 
would like to use your own, then this is the file to edit. Once you 
enable the system, your preferences are stored in a separate file in a 
system dependant location. On Windows, they will be stored in 
lib/user/pickpref-</font><font color="#ff9200">NAME</font><font color="#ffffff">.prf inside the game's directory structure, while 
on Linux, they can be found in 
~/.angband/PosChengband/pickpref-</font><font color="#ff9200">NAME</font><font color="#ffffff">.prf (outside the game's directory 
structure). Here, </font><font color="#ff9200">NAME </font><font color="#ffffff">is replaced with your player's current name. So 
if you want to edit your preferences using some other text editor, this 
is the file you need to change. If you do edit preferences outside of 
the game while you are playing, then be sure to use the </font><font color="#ff9200">$ </font><font color="#ffffff">command to 
force the game to reload the preference file.

OK, so I promised you reference tables. I'm a man of my word, so here 
they are. Enjoy!

</font><font color="#00c8ff">Table II: Rules: Syntax
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Rules have one of the following two syntactic forms:

  </font><font color="#ffffff">Square brackets denote optional syntactic elements. * is the 
  Kleene-Star and indicates that 0 or more of the preceding syntactic 
  elements may be specified. All rules must be specified on a single 
  line in your preference file.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Syntactic Element  Explanation
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Commands           These are actions to take whenever this rule 
                     matches. They are built up with command leters as 
                     described in the next table. If this element is 
                     omitted, then this rule will pickup any matching 
                     objects.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Adjective          </font><font color="#ffffff">These modify Nouns, further narrowing down the set 
                     of objects that will match this rule.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Noun               </font><font color="#ffffff">A single noun is always specified for the first 
                     syntactic form and indicates the broad class of 
                     objects to which this rule shall apply.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Special-Clause     </font><font color="#ffffff">These consist of further rule match refinements 
                     and are discussed below. They are like adjectives 
                     in that they modify nouns, but they also involve 
                     some sort of numerical comparison of an object 
                     attribute, and therefore require special syntax. 
                     They also always follow the Noun while Adjectives 
                     precede the Noun.
  
  Search-String      This is a free form text value to compare against 
                     the object's name. Comparison is by string and is 
                     case-insensitive. In addition, you may use the </font><font color="#ff9200">^ 
                     </font><font color="#ffffff">special character at the beginning of a 
                     Search-String to force your match to the beginning 
                     of an object name, and the </font><font color="#ff9200">$ </font><font color="#ffffff">special character at 
                     the end of a Search-String to force your match to 
                     the end of the object name. For example, </font><font color="#ff4040">^Foo </font><font color="#ffffff">will 
                     only match objects whose names begin with </font><font color="#ff4040">Foo</font><font color="#ffffff">, and 
                     will skip other objects that might have </font><font color="#ff4040">Foo 
                     </font><font color="#ffffff">somewhere in the name, but not at the beginning. 
                     Similarly, </font><font color="#ff4040">Bar$ </font><font color="#ffffff">only matches objects whose name 
                     ends with </font><font color="#ff4040">Bar </font><font color="#ffffff">and skips any that might have </font><font color="#ff4040">Bar 
                     </font><font color="#ffffff">someplace in the middle of its name. Finally note 
                     that an object's name is always in the singular. 
                     So, for example, </font><font color="#ff4040">Seeker Bolt </font><font color="#ffffff">would work for a 
                     string match, but </font><font color="#ff4040">Seeker Bolts </font><font color="#ffffff">would always fail.
  
  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Inscription-String </font><font color="#ffffff">This is a free form text value that will be 
                     automatically inscribed on any object matching 
                     this rule.
  
  If you didn't understand some of that, you should probably review the 
  tutorial sections above, starting with <a href="editor.html#IntroRulesEvents"></font><font color="#00ff00">[i]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">. The examples section 
  above, in particular, is probably the best way to learn what is going 
  on.

  </font><font color="#00ff00">Noun       Explanation
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Items      </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to everything. This is useful for very general 
             rules, such as ~?</font><font color="#00ff00">Unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">to automatically 
             identify, but leave on the ground, everything not yet 
             identified.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons    </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all melees weapons, but not to missile weapons. 
             If you are a veteran player, then read that description 
             again. This noun used to include shooters, but I just 
             recently changed the semantics to accomodate archers who 
             are very interested in </font><font color="#00ff00">Dice Boosted </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters </font><font color="#ffffff">but could 
             usually care less about </font><font color="#00ff00">Dice Boosted </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons</font><font color="#ffffff">. Also, monks 
             may want to !</font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">since they usually fight bare-handed, 
             and having this rule also destroy shooters is quite 
             annoying.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Favorite Weapons
             </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all weapons, including shooters, that are 
             desired by your class. For example, Weaponmasters 
             specialize in a given class of weapons, such as Axes or 
             Crossbows. Whatever their speciality, this "noun" will 
             apply to these preferred items. Calling this "keyword" a 
             noun is a bit of a misnomer, but it will help you to think 
             of </font><font color="#ff4040">Favorite Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">as a single word that is a </font><font color="#ff4040">Noun</font><font color="#ffffff">, since 
             the code treats it that way! For example, saying </font><font color="#00ff00">Ego 
             </font><font color="#ff4040">Favorite Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">is syntactically correct, while </font><font color="#00ff00">Favorite 
             Ego </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">is not. (There is no adjective called 
             </font><font color="#00ff00">Favorite</font><font color="#ffffff">).
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Hafted Weapons
             </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all hafted weapons like Maces, Flails and War 
             Hammers. These weapons are preferred by Priests who 
             disdain other kinds of weapons, such as Swords or 
             Polearms. Like the </font><font color="#ff4040">Favorite Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">"noun" above, it helps 
             to think of </font><font color="#ff4040">Hafted Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">as a single word that is a 
             </font><font color="#ff4040">Noun</font><font color="#ffffff">, since the code treats it that way (There is no 
             adjective </font><font color="#00ff00">Hafted</font><font color="#ffffff">). If you are a priest interested in 
             excellent and artifact hafted weapons, you need to say </font><font color="#00ff00">Ego 
             </font><font color="#ff4040">Hafted Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#00ff00">Artifact </font><font color="#ff4040">Hafted Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">to get the job 
             done.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Diggers    </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all digging implements, such as shovels and 
             picks. Digging is fun, but eventually you will probably 
             want to destroy these objects. Perhaps, you would like the 
             rule ~</font><font color="#00ff00">Dice Boosted </font><font color="#ff4040">Diggers</font><font color="#ffffff">:Mattock followed by the rule 
             !</font><font color="#ff4040">Diggers</font><font color="#ffffff">?
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters   </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all missile weapons, including bows, slings and 
             crossbows. It also includes harps and guns. If you are a 
             Bard, then you might consider </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters</font><font color="#ffffff">:Harp as a pickup 
             preference, while if you are ignoring archery altogether, 
             try </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters</font><font color="#ffffff">:Gun instead since the guns are quite useful 
             for resistances and boosting stats.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Ammo       </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all ammunition for missile weapons: arrows, 
             shots and bolts. Consider using </font><font color="#ff4040">Ammo</font><font color="#ffffff">:Seeker or 
             </font><font color="#ff4040">Ammo</font><font color="#ffffff">:Mithril or </font><font color="#ff4040">Ammo</font><font color="#ffffff">:Steel to pick out desirable ammo.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Armors     </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all forms of armor, including shields, helms, 
             cloaks as well as body armor. You can narrow down the 
             range of armor objects by using a more specific noun from 
             the following list:
             </font><font color="#ff4040">Suits   </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to body armor

             </font><font color="#ff4040">Gloves  </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to gloves
             </font><font color="#ff4040">Boots   </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to boots
             Consider using </font><font color="#ff4040">Armors</font><font color="#ffffff">:Dragon to pickup all the various 
             forms of dragon armor, including dragon boots, gloves, 
             helmets and wings. If you are playing a class with armor 
             weight restrictions, check out the </font><font color="#ff9200">More Weight Than NN 
             </font><font color="#ffffff">special clause below.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Wands      </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to magical devices that are wands. Use 
             </font><font color="#ff4040">Wands</font><font color="#ffffff">:Rockets to get all wands, including ego and artifact 
             wands, that can fire rockets (Trust me: You want them!). 
             Note: We no longer have a noun </font><font color="#ff4040">Magical Devices</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Staves     </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to magical devices that are staves. For example, 
             try </font><font color="#ff4040">Staves</font><font color="#ffffff">:Healing or </font><font color="#ff4040">Staves</font><font color="#ffffff">:Speed.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Rods       </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to magical devices that are rods.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Potions    </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to potions. There are many useful potions. If you 
             are trying to get stat potions, you might consider 
             </font><font color="#ff4040">Potions</font><font color="#ffffff">:of Strength rather than just </font><font color="#ff4040">Potions</font><font color="#ffffff">:Strength, 
             since the latter will also match potions of restore 
             strength.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Scrolls    </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to scrolls
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Rings      </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to jewelry that are rings. Since rings are so 
             useful, I like the rule ?</font><font color="#00ff00">Unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">Rings </font><font color="#ffffff">for all of my 
             characters.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Amulets    </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to jewelry that are amulets. Like rings, I prefer 
             to keep the rule ?</font><font color="#00ff00">Unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">Amulets </font><font color="#ffffff">for all of my 
             characters.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Lights     </font><font color="#ffffff">These are torches, lanterns and feanorian lamps, as well 
             as the various artifact light sources. If you are looking 
             for the Jewel of Judgment, try using </font><font color="#ff4040">Lights</font><font color="#ffffff">:Jewel.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Spellbooks </font><font color="#ffffff">These are all the spellbooks, for all of the various 
             magical realms. If you are a spellcaster, you will 
             invariably want to make use of the numerous spellbook 
             specific adjectives described in the next table.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Junk       </font><font color="#ffffff">Need I say more? You probably just need !</font><font color="#ff4040">Junk </font><font color="#ffffff">in your pref 
             file, though some junk might be useful for some players.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses    </font><font color="#ffffff">Corpses actually can be useful. For one thing, every 
             player can turn in </font><font color="#00ff00">Wanted </font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses </font><font color="#ffffff">at the Hunter's Office 
             for prizes. And then there are possessors, a monster race 
             that can actually possess the corpse of a slain foe and 
             gain the powers of that monster type. They will want to 
             make use of rules like ~</font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses </font><font color="#ff9200">More Level Than 20 </font><font color="#ffffff">which 
             uses a special form described below. Of course, they will 
             tweak the level threshold of corpses they wish to keep as 
             the game progresses, and they also need to be careful to 
             keep rather than pickup these desirable objects: Corpses 
             can be very heavy! Note that Skeletons no longer count as 
             corpses, mainly because Possessors cannot possess 
             skeletons so they require a more specific keyword. If you 
             are a hungry demon, you might consider </font><font color="#00ff00">Human </font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Skeletons  </font><font color="#ffffff">Like corpses, you may turn in </font><font color="#00ff00">Wanted </font><font color="#ff4040">Skeletons </font><font color="#ffffff">at the

             arrows and bolts, so this class of objects is not as 
             useless as you might have thought.
  
  If you are using keywords to build a match predicate, then you must 
  specify exactly one noun. But you may use as many adjectives as you 
  like.
  
</font><font color="#00c8ff">Table V: Rules: Adjectives
  </font><font color="#ffffff">There are many adjectives, and perhaps it might be useful to group 
  them by kind?
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Object Knowledge
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Unsensed     </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to objects that have not yet been identified nor 
               even pseudo-identified. In this sense, it is more 
               inclusive then the </font><font color="#00ff00">Unidentified </font><font color="#ffffff">adjective. Use a rule 
               like (</font><font color="#00ff00">Unsensed </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">to (i) automatically pickup newly 
               dropped weapons so that you can pseudo-id them in your 
               pack in the early to mid game; and (ii) automatically 
               travel to newly dropped weapons in the remainder of the 
               game using the newly enhanced </font><font color="#ff9200">g</font><font color="#ffffff">et objects command (Turn 
               on </font><font color="#ff4040">auto_get_objects</font><font color="#ffffff">).  If </font><font color="#ff4040">destroy_feeling </font><font color="#ffffff">is turned on, 
               the set of rules will be rescanned once the given item 
               is sensed, either in your pack at some future time 
               (prior to CL35) or by stepping on the same square as the 
               object (once you reach CL35).  If </font><font color="#ff4040">destroy_identify </font><font color="#ffffff">is 
               turned on, the set of rules will be rescanned once you 
               identify the object.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Unidentified </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to objects that have not yet been identified and 
               is a very useful adjective. For example, ?</font><font color="#00ff00">Unidentified 
               </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">has to be my favorite rule of all time!
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Identified   </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies all objects that have been identified. You might 
               use this with a rule like !</font><font color="#00ff00">Identified </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons</font><font color="#ffffff">, preceded 
               by rules to protect weapons you actually care about, 
               like dice boosted ego items, for example. But I think it 
               is almost always preferable to use a !</font><font color="#00ff00">Nameless Common 
               </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">rule instead, since it is much safer (e.g. It 
               won't destroy rare objects like Blades of Chaos and 
               won't destroy egos either).
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">*Identified* </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to fully identified objects, and is rarely 
               needed. Perhaps you might consider a block of rules 
               like:
               ~</font><font color="#00ff00">*identified* </font><font color="#ff4040">rings </font><font color="#ff9200">more value than 5000
               </font><font color="#ffffff">~</font><font color="#00ff00">*identified* </font><font color="#ff4040">amulets </font><font color="#ff9200">more value than 5000
               </font><font color="#ffffff">~?</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">rings
               </font><font color="#ffffff">~?</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">amulets
               </font><font color="#ffffff">!</font><font color="#00ff00">identified </font><font color="#ff4040">rings
               </font><font color="#ffffff">!</font><font color="#00ff00">identified </font><font color="#ff4040">amulets
               </font><font color="#ffffff">But this requires you to have a good sense of the value 
               threshold for jewelry you might want. Also note that 
               this rule set is safe because, in the current version, 
               identifying jewelry also *identifies* it. Do not try 
               this pattern with other types of objects!
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Unaware      </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to objects that the player is unaware of. In 
               practice, this currently only includes mushrooms, 
               potions and scrolls that the player has not yet 
               encountered. A rule like ?</font><font color="#00ff00">Unaware </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">will help you 
               learn all those flavors in the early game.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Object Quality
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Average      </font><font color="#ffffff">Just like the name says, this adjective matches average 
               items. These are items that lack any form of magical 
               bonus or enhancment. This adjective is best combined 
               with the ! command letter at a very early point in the 
               game :)
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Good         </font><font color="#ffffff">Good items have a magical bonus of some kind, either a 
               combat bonus to hit or damage for </font><font color="#ff4040">weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#ff4040">shooters</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
               or an armor class bonus for </font><font color="#ff4040">armors</font><font color="#ffffff">. You might want to 
               hang on to these objects a bit longer since they can be 
               sold for gold in the town, but even here, you will want 
               to destroy them eventually. I usually use the rule 
               !</font><font color="#00ff00">Nameless Common </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">rather than the </font><font color="#00ff00">Good </font><font color="#ffffff">adjective, 
               since </font><font color="#00ff00">Nameless </font><font color="#ffffff">will include average items as well, while 
               the </font><font color="#00ff00">Common </font><font color="#ffffff">adjective protects objects that are rare and 
               might still be useful, even if they are only Average or 
               Good (e.g. Dragon Scale Mail).
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Ego          </font><font color="#ffffff">Applies to all excellent objects. See <a href="objects.html#EgoObjects"></font><font color="#00ff00">[j]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more 
               information.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Artifact     </font><font color="#ffffff">Artifacts are special items and are unique. Think of 
               them as super-ego objects that you can only find one of 
               in each game you play. I almost never use this 
               adjective, though, since you cannot destroy artifacts 
               anyway. Perhaps you might like to auto-identify them, 
               though, and a rule like ?</font><font color="#00ff00">Artifact </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">would accomplish 
               this.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Cursed       </font><font color="#ffffff">Cursed items aren't necessarily all bad. Still, you 
               might want rules to handle these objects, for example, 
               to destroy them. Also note that objects can be </font><font color="#00ff00">Cursed 
               Ego </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">or even </font><font color="#00ff00">Cursed Artifact </font><font color="#ff4040">Items</font><font color="#ffffff">, so perhaps the 
               rule you are looking for is !</font><font color="#00ff00">Cursed Nameless Common 
               </font><font color="#ff4040">Items</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Nameless     </font><font color="#ffffff">Nameless applies to any object that is neither an 
               artifact nor an ego item. This adjective is commonly 
               used to destroy stuff that you know won't be 
               particularly good, usually as a rule of the form 
               !</font><font color="#00ff00">Nameless Common </font><font color="#ff4040">Items</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Rare         </font><font color="#ffffff">Rare items are special objects that don't show up often, 
               and might still be desirable even if they are </font><font color="#00ff00">Nameless</font><font color="#ffffff">. 
               For example, and hopefully this won't spoil too much, 
               weapons like Blades of Chaos and armors like Dragon 
               Scale Mail are considered </font><font color="#00ff00">Rare</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Common       </font><font color="#ffffff">Common includes any object that is </font><font color="#a500ff">not </font><font color="#00ff00">Rare</font><font color="#ffffff">. So, a Long 
               Sword is common, but a Blade of Chaos is not. Metal 
               Scale Mail is common, but White Dragon Scale Mail is 
               not.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Worthless    </font><font color="#ffffff">Any object whose value is 0 is considered </font><font color="#00ff00">Worthless</font><font color="#ffffff">. 
               This doesn't necessarily mean you want to destroy it, 
               though. For example, Corpses are worthless, but you 
               still want some of them. In general, you will want rules 
               to protect the worthless items you might want, and then, 
               at the very bottom of your preference file, you add a 
               rule !</font><font color="#00ff00">Worthless </font><font color="#ff4040">Items</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Object Attributes
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Dice Boosted </font><font color="#ffffff">When used with </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters</font><font color="#ffffff">, this adjective 
               indicates that the object has higher damage dice than 
               usual. Archers in particular should be on the lookout 
               for </font><font color="#00ff00">Dice Boosted </font><font color="#ff4040">Shooters</font><font color="#ffffff">!
  
  See the </font><font color="#ff9200">Special Clauses </font><font color="#ffffff">below for more information about matching on 
  an object's attributes.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Spellbook Adjectives
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Unreadable     </font><font color="#ffffff">This will match spellbooks that you cannot use, either 
                 because you are playing a non-magical class, or 
                 because you did not choose to learn that particular 
                 magical realm at birth. The most common use for this 
                 adjective is for destruction purposes, as in 
                 !</font><font color="#00ff00">Unreadable </font><font color="#ff4040">Spellbooks</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">First Realm's  </font><font color="#ffffff">This refers to your primary magical realm. For many 
                 players, this is their only magic realm. For example, 
                 if you are playing a High-Mage, Paladin, Monk, Rogue 
                 or Chaos-Warrior, then you can pick a single realm of 
                 magic at birth.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Second Realm's </font><font color="#ffffff">This refers to your secondary magical realm. If you 
                 are playing a Mage, Priest or Ranger, then you can 
                 pick two realms of magic at birth. The most common 
                 reason to distinguish between your first and second 
                 realms of magic has to do with inscriptions. 
                 Typically, players inscribe </font><font color="#ffcc80">@ma </font><font color="#ffffff">through </font><font color="#ffcc80">@md</font><font color="#ffffff">, in order, 
                 on their first realm's spellbooks, and use </font><font color="#ffcc80">@me </font><font color="#ffffff">through 
                 </font><font color="#ffcc80">@mh</font><font color="#ffffff">, in order, on their second realm's spellbooks. Or 
                 you might use </font><font color="#ffcc80">@m1 </font><font color="#ffffff">through </font><font color="#ffcc80">@m8 </font><font color="#ffffff">if you prefer.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">First
  Second
  Third
  Fourth         </font><font color="#ffffff">Each realm of magic has four possible spellbooks. 
                 These adjectives refer to each of these possibilities. 
                 For every school except Arcane, only the first and 
                 second spellbooks are available in town, while the 
                 third and fourth spellbooks must be found in the 
                 dungeon. They can be quite rare, and are also valuable 
                 objects, so one typically wants to distinguish between 
                 first and second spellbooks on the one hand, and third 
                 and fourth on the other. Also, combine these 
                 adjectives with the </font><font color="#00ff00">First Realm's </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#00ff00">Second Realm's 
                 </font><font color="#ffffff">adjectives discussed above in order to get your 
                 inscriptions setup properly (see </font><font color="#00c8ff">Scenario #3 </font><font color="#ffffff">above).
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Corpse Adjectives
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Wanted       </font><font color="#ffffff">Combine with </font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Skeletons </font><font color="#ffffff">to indicate that the 
               corpse or skeleton belongs to a wanted monster. These 
               may be turned in at the Hunter's Office for a prize.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Unique       </font><font color="#ffffff">Combine with </font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Skeletons </font><font color="#ffffff">to indicate that the 
               corpse or skeleton belongs to a unique monster. Not all 
               unique monsters are </font><font color="#00ff00">Wanted</font><font color="#ffffff">, so many players would 
               consider them to be junk (They are destroyed by the 
               default rule !</font><font color="#00ff00">Worthless </font><font color="#ff4040">Items</font><font color="#ffffff">). However, other players 
               enjoy collecting the corpses of unique monsters, and 
               placing them on display at the museum. For these 
               (strange?) folks, adding a rule like ~</font><font color="#00ff00">Unique </font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses 
               </font><font color="#ffffff">before the !</font><font color="#00ff00">Worthless </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">will protect them from 
               default destruction.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Human        </font><font color="#ffffff">And then there are those character's that require the 
               corpses of humans for either food, or as part of a 
               ritual to summon a powerful demonic ally. For these 
               situations, add a rule like ~</font><font color="#00ff00">Human </font><font color="#ff4040">Corpses </font><font color="#ffffff">to your 
               preferences, though ~</font><font color="#00ff00">Special </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">also works.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Miscellaneous
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Collecting   Collecting </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">are stackable objects that you happen 
               to currently be carrying in your pack. Use this broad 
               adjective when you don't feel like adding a more 
               specific rule. For example, you might currently be 
               carrying Potions of Cure Serious Wounds, and would like 
               to collect those if you happen to find them. But since 
               these objects are only useful for a very small portion 
               of the game, you don't want to use a conditional rule to 
               handle this.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Special      Special </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">are objects your race or class needs; 
               objects that are usually considered junk by default. For 
               example, some players cannot eat normal food, but must 
               consume the corpses of humans (Yuk!). Other players use 
               corpses for various spells, and need to keep them 
               around. Archers use skeletons to make their own ammo. 
               And classes that ride pets into battle actually enjoy 
               using devices that haste monsters. All of these special 
               scenarios are handled with this adjective.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Unusable     </font><font color="#ffffff">This adjective applies to wearable items that your 
               current character is unable to wear. Doe this sound 
               strange? It is, but remember that you have the option to 
               play the game as a </font><font color="#c00000">Monster</font><font color="#ffffff">, and monsters often have 
               unusual body types. For example, a Dragon can wear 
               rings, amulets, lights, cloaks and helmets, but nothing 
               else. So weapons, shooters, body armor, shields, gloves, 
               and boots are all considered </font><font color="#00ff00">Unusable</font><font color="#ffffff">. Adding a rule 
               like !</font><font color="#00ff00">Unusable </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">makes the game much more pleasant, 
               at least once the player is past the point of worrying 
               too much about gold. (They could also use a rule like 
               !</font><font color="#00ff00">Unusable Nameless </font><font color="#ff4040">Items </font><font color="#ffffff">if they wanted to keep egos for 
               resale purposes).
  
</font><font color="#00c8ff">Table VI: Rules: Special Clauses
  </font><font color="#ffffff">In the following clauses, N refers to a numerical digit, 0 through 9. 
  The sequence NN means you may type one or two digits, and can 
  therefore enter any number between 0 and 99.  The sequence NNNNNN 
  means you may type from one to six digits, and can therefore enter 
  any number between 0 and 999999. If you enter too many digits, then 
  the parser will not recognize your special clause, and you will get 
  unsatisfactory results from your rule.
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Special Clause          Explanation
  </font><font color="#ff9200">More Dice Than NN       </font><font color="#ffffff">This clause applies to </font><font color="#ff4040">Weapons </font><font color="#ffffff">only, and is 
                          true whenever the maximum possible damage 
                          exceeds the number you enter. For example a 
                          (2d5) weapon will match </font><font color="#ff9200">More Dice Than 9 </font><font color="#ffffff">but 
                          will fail to match </font><font color="#ff9200">More Dice Than 10</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">More Bonus Than NN      </font><font color="#ffffff">An object's bonus is the largest of its </font><font color="#ff4040">pval</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
                          its bonus to hit, to damage and to armor 
                          class. Confused? Well, the rule </font><font color="#ff4040">Rings </font><font color="#ff9200">More

                          rings of speed. Another (sarcastic) example:

  </font><font color="#ff9200">More Value Than NNNNNN </font><font color="#ffffff">This clause matches against the known value of

</font><font color="#00c8ff">Table VII: Conditional Lines: Syntax
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Conditional Lines have the following syntactic form:
  
  ?:</font><font color="#00c8ff">Expression
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Conditional Expressions use the following (partial) grammar:

  Note that unlike above, square brackets are part of the syntax of 
  expressions and do </font><font color="#a500ff">not </font><font color="#ffffff">indicate optional elements in the grammar. 
  Rather, function application expressions are always surrounded with 
  square brackets.
  
  When the expression on a conditional line evaluates to FALSE or 0, 
  then any subsequent rules will be ignored. When the expression 
  evaluates to TRUE or non-zero, then any subsequent rules will be 
  applied.
  
  If none of this makes sense, see <a href="editor.html#Conditionals"></font><font color="#00ff00">[k]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">above.

            </font><font color="#c00000">Monster </font><font color="#ffffff">mode, then this variable always returns </font><font color="#ff4040">Monster</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
            while $RACE returns the actual monster race you are 
            playing, such as </font><font color="#ff4040">Lich </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Dragon</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  </font><font color="#ff4040">$REALM1   </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the name of the player's first realm, if any. For 
            example, </font><font color="#ff4040">Chaos </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">Sorcery</font><font color="#ffffff">. If the player does not have a

  </font><font color="#ff4040">$REALM2   </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the name of the player's second realm, if any. For

  </font><font color="#ff4040">$LEVEL    </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the player's current level. Typically, you combine 
            this with GEQ or LEQ to test the level against a threshold,

  </font><font color="#ff4040">$MONEY    </font><font color="#ffffff">Returns the amount of gold the player has. Like $LEVEL, use 
            this with GEQ or LEQ to test whether your player is rich or 
            poor.
  
  As mentioned before, all variables begin with a </font><font color="#ff9200">$ </font><font color="#ffffff">character to 
  distinguish them from string literals. Also, note there are other 
  variables like $SYS and $KEYBOARD which I haven't documented.

</font><font color="#ffffff">If, after reading all of the above, you decide that The Mogaminator is 
too much for you to handle, you may, instead, use a simpler system to 
manage objects: The Easy Destroyer. I don't recommend this, but the 
choice is yours. This system is configured via options (see <a href="option.html#AutoDestroyer"></font><font color="#00ff00">[l]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">). The 
option destroy_items turns The Easy Destroyer on and off. If you are 
using The Mogaminator, be sure to turn off The Easy Destroyer, and vice 
versa. (BTW, you "turn off" The Mogaminator but closing the game and 
deleting the pickpref-</font><font color="#ff9200">NAME</font><font color="#ffffff">.prf file whose location was indicated in the 
reference section).
