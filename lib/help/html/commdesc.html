<font color="#00c8ff">Command Descriptions

</font><font color="#ffffff">The following command descriptions are listed as the command name plus 
the </font><font color="#ff4040">underlying command </font><font color="#ffffff">key. This is followed by the command name and 
</font><font color="#ff4040">roguelike keyset </font><font color="#ffffff">key, if different from the underlying command key. 
Then comes a brief description of the command, including information 
about alternative methods of specifying the command in each keyset, 
when needed.

Several commands (tunnel, disarm, bash, open) are repeated 99 times if 
the </font><font color="#ff4040">always_repeat </font><font color="#ffffff">option is set and no repeat count is given. Some 
commands use the </font><font color="#ff4040">repeat count </font><font color="#ffffff">to automatically repeat the command 
several times, while others use the repeat count as an argument. For 
example, commands which need a quantity will use the repeat count 
instead of asking for a quantity, allowing the use of </font><font color="#ff9200">0d </font><font color="#ffffff">to drop all. 
Commands which ask for a quantity will convert any letters into the 
maximal legal value.

<a name="Inventory"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Inventory Commands

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Inventory List (</font><font color="#ff9200">i</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Displays a list of objects being carried but not equipped. You can 
  carry up to 26 different items, not counting those in your equipment. 
  Often, many identical objects can be "stacked" into a "pile" which 
  will count as a single item. This is always true of things like 
  potions, scrolls, food, ammo and spellbooks. Basically, if two 
  objects are exactly the same, they will stack into a single pile in 
  your inventory. Each object also has a weight, and if you carry more 
  objects than your strength permits, you will begin to slow down. Here 
  is a sample:
  
    Inventory: carrying 43.2 pounds (36% of capacity):
      a) </font><font color="#ffcc80">, 5 Rations of Food                    </font><font color="#ffffff">5.0 lb
      b) </font><font color="#fffd00">! 5 Flasks of oil                      </font><font color="#ffffff">5.0 lb
      c) </font><font color="#ffcc80">~ </font><font color="#fffd00">3 Brass Lanterns {unidentified}     </font><font color="#ffffff">15.0 lb
      d) </font><font color="#ffcc80">( </font><font color="#8c8c8c">Hard Leather Armour [6]             </font><font color="#ffffff">10.0 lb
      e) </font><font color="#00c000">( </font><font color="#ffcc80">a Cloak [1]                          </font><font color="#ffffff">1.0 lb
      f) </font><font color="#ffcc80">] a Pair of Soft Leather Boots [2]     </font><font color="#ffffff">2.0 lb
  
 
  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Equipment List (</font><font color="#ff9200">e</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to display a list of the objects currently being 
  used by your character. Your character typically has 12 slots for 
  equipment each corresponding to a different location on the body, and 
  each of which may contain only a single object at a time, and each of 
  which may only contain objects of the proper type. Note, that some 
  races and most monster forms have a different type from the typical 
  humanoid, so the number and types of your equipment slots can vary. 
  However, most of the time, your body will look something like the 
  following sample (Taken from a starting Warrior):
  
    a) | Right Hand: a Broad Sword (2d5) (+0,+0)      15.0 lb
    b) </font><font color="#ffcc80">) </font><font color="#ffffff">Left Hand : </font><font color="#ffcc80">a Small Leather Shield [3,+0]     </font><font color="#ffffff">5.0 lb
    c) </font><font color="#8c8c8c">} </font><font color="#ffffff">Shooting  : </font><font color="#ffcc80">a Light Crossbow (x4) (+0,+0)    </font><font color="#ffffff">11.0 lb
    d)   Right Ring:
    e)   Left Ring :
    f)   Neck      :
    g)   Light     :
    h) </font><font color="#8c8c8c">[ </font><font color="#ffffff">Body      : </font><font color="#8c8c8c">Chain Mail (-2) [14,+0]          </font><font color="#ffffff">22.0 lb
    i)   Cloak     :
    j)   Head      :
    k)   Hands     :
    l)   Feet      :
  
  Each slot has a descriptive label, like "Right Hand" that determines 
  what type of object it may receive, like a weapon or shield. And yes, 
  you can wield a weapon in either hand, or even in both (Using the 
  skill of </font><font color="#00c8ff">Dual Wielding</font><font color="#ffffff">). You can even wear two shields if you aren't 
  using melee fighting at all. The choice is yours! The types for each 
  slot should be easy to figure out: Helmets go on your "Head" slot and 
  Gloves go on your "Hands", etc.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Get Objects (</font><font color="#ff9200">g</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will get any objects located on the same tile as the 
  player (autodestroyer applies). If there are no objects under the 
  player, then this command does not cause the player to lose a turn.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Auto-Get Objects (</font><font color="#ff9200">^G</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will get any objects located on the same tile as the 
  player (autodestroyer applies). In addition, this command will 
  automatically get nearby objects by travelling to them (similar to 
  running). With </font><font color="#ff4040">auto_get_objects </font><font color="#ffffff">enabled, any object registered for 
  either auto-pickup or auto-destroy will qualify for automatic get. If 
  that is too much for you (perhaps you enjoy cleaning up after 
  battles?) then the </font><font color="#ff4040">auto_get_ammo </font><font color="#ffffff">option only applies to objects 
  inscribed with </font><font color="#ff9200">=g </font><font color="#ffffff">(which is typically your ammo, or perhaps spikes if 
  you are a ninja).
  
  Automatic travelling is very useful, and you won't travel too far 
  since the objects must be visible to qualify. Hence, this option is 
  much safer than, say, travelling using the object list which allows 
  you to undertake lengthy automatic journeys (often into harms way!). 
  The automatic get travelling will terminate when there are no more 
  visible qualifying objects; if your pack becomes full; or if you are 
  disturbed for any reason, such as a nasty dragon waking up and 
  deciding to breathe on you.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Drop Item (</font><font color="#ff9200">d</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the dungeon 
  floor. If the floor spot you are standing on already has an object in 
  it, the game will attempt to drop the item onto an adjacent space. Be 
  warned that if the floor is full and you attempt to drop something, 
  it may disappear and be destroyed. Doors and traps are considered 
  objects for the purpose of determining if the space is occupied. If 
  the selected pile contains multiple items, you may specify a 
  quantity.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Destroy Item (</font><font color="#ff9200">k</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">^D</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This destroys an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor. If 
  the selected pile contains multiple objects, you may specify a 
  quantity. You must always (currently) verify this command.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Wear/Wield Equipment (</font><font color="#ff9200">w</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">To wear or wield an object in your inventory, use this command. Since 
  only one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield 
  an item into a slot which is already occupied, the old item will be 
  first be taken off, and may in fact be dropped if there is no room 
  for it in your inventory.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Take Off Equipment (</font><font color="#ff9200">t</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">T</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to take off a piece of equipment and return it to 
  your inventory. Occasionally, you will run into a cursed item which 
  cannot be removed. These items normally penalize you in some way and 
  cannot be taken off until the curse is removed. If there is no room 
  in your inventory for the item, your pack will overflow and you will 
  drop the item after taking it off.

<a name="Movement"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Movement Commands

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Walk (with pickup) (</font><font color="#ff9200">;</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Moves one step in the given direction. The square you are moving into 
  must not be blocked by walls or doors. You will pick up any items in 
  the destination grid if the "always_pickup" option is set, or if the 
  "query_pickup" option is set and you respond correctly. This command 
  can take a count and requires a direction.  You may also use the 
  "original" direction keys (both keysets) or the "roguelike" direction 
  keys (roguelike keyset) to walk in a direction. If object 
  auto-picker/destroyer is set up, specified objects will be picked up 
  or destroyed.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Walk (flip pickup) (</font><font color="#ff9200">-</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This is just like normal move, except that the "Pick things up" 
  option is inverted. In other words, if you normally pick up anything 
  you encounter (the default), you will not pick things up when using 
  this command. If you normally do not pick things up, you will when 
  using this command. This command can take a count and requires a 
  direction.  If object auto-picker/destroyer is set up, specified 
  objects will be picked up or destroyed.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Run (</font><font color="#ff9200">.</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">,</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will move in the given direction, following any bends in 
  the corridor, until you either have to make a "choice" between two 
  directions or you are disturbed. You can configure what will disturb 
  you by setting the disturbance options. Run requires a direction. You 
  may also use shift plus the "roguelike" direction keys (roguelike 
  keyset), or shift plus the "original" direction keys on the keypad 
  (both keysets, some machines) to run in a direction. If object 
  auto-picker/destroyer is set up, specified objects will be picked up 
  or destroyed.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Go Up Staircase (</font><font color="#ff9200">&lt;</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Climbs up when you are standing on an up staircase. In the 
  wilderness, enter global map mode which grants you a view of all the 
  world unless there are some monsters in the nearby area.
  
  There is always at least one staircase going up on every level except 
  for the town level (this doesn't mean it's easy to find). Going up a 
  staircase will take you to a new dungeon level unless you are at 50 
  feet (dungeon level 1), in which case you will return to the town 
  level. Note that unlike many other variants, levels are persistent. 
  This means if you go back down the same stairs you will re-enter the 
  level you just left. Once you go back to town, however, all of the 
  previously visited floors are forgotten, and you will need to explore 
  anew.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Go Down Staircase (</font><font color="#ff9200">&gt;</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Descends when you are standing on a down staircase. In the 
  wilderness, return from global map mode to normal mode.
  
  There are always at least two staircases going down on each level, 
  except for the town which has only one, and "quest" levels, which 
  have none until the quest monster is killed. Going down a staircase 
  will take you to a new dungeon level. See "Go Up Staircase" for more 
  info.

<a name="Resting"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Resting Commands

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Stay Still (with pickup) (</font><font color="#ff9200">,</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">.</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Stays in the same square for one move. If you normally pick up 
  objects you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on. 
  This command can take a count. You may also use the "5" key (both 
  keysets).  If object auto-picker/destroyer is set up, specified 
  objects will be picked up or destroyed.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Rest (</font><font color="#ff9200">R</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Resting is better for you than repeatedly staying still, and can be 
  told to automatically stop after a certain amount of time, or when 
  various conditions are met. In any case, you always wake up when 
  anything disturbing happens, or when you press any key. To rest, 
  enter the Rest command, followed by the number of turns you want to 
  rest, or "*" to rest until your hitpoints and mana are restored, or 
  "&amp;" to rest until you are fully "healed". This command can take a 
  count, which is used for the number of turns to rest.

<a name="Searching"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Searching Commands

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Search (</font><font color="#ff9200">s</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command can be used to locate hidden traps and secret doors in 
  the spaces adjacent to the player. More than a single turn of 
  searching will be required in most cases. You should always search a 
  chest before trying to open it, since they are generally trapped. 
  This command can take a count, which is useful if you are fairly sure 
  of finding something eventually, since the command stops as soon as 
  anything is found. This command can take a count.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Toggle Search Mode (</font><font color="#ff9200">S</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">#</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will take you into and out of search mode. When first 
  pressed, the message "Searching" will appear at the bottom of the 
  screen. You are now taking two turns for each command, one for the 
  command and one turn to search. This means that you are taking twice 
  the time to move around the dungeon, and therefore twice the food. 
  Search mode will automatically turn off if you are disturbed. You may 
  also turn off search mode by entering the Search Mode command again.

<a name="Alter"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Alter Commands

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Tunnel (</font><font color="#ff9200">T</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">^T</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Tunneling or mining is a very useful art. There are many kinds of 
  rock, with varying hardness, including:
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80"># </font><font color="#ffffff">Permanent Rock   Permanent
    # Granite          Very Hard
    % Quartz Veins     Hard
    </font><font color="#8c8c8c">% </font><font color="#ffffff">Magma veins      Soft
    : Rubble           Very Soft
  
  Quartz and Magma veins may sometimes contain treasure, in which case 
  they will be displayed as </font><font color="#ff9200">*</font><font color="#ffffff">. Rubble sometimes covers an object. It is 
  hard to tunnel unless you are wielding a heavy weapon or a shovel or 
  a pick. Tunneling ability increases with strength and weapon weight. 
  This command can take a count, requires a direction, and is affected 
  by the "always_repeat" option.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Open a Door or Chest (</font><font color="#ff9200">o</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">To open an object such as a door or chest, you must use this command. 
  If the object is locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based on 
  your disarming ability. If you open a trapped chest without disarming 
  the traps first, the trap will be set off. Some doors will be jammed 
  shut and may have to be forced open. You may need several tries to 
  open a door or chest. Open can take a count, requires a direction, 
  and is affected by the "always_repeat" option.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Close a Door (</font><font color="#ff9200">c</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Non-intelligent and some other creatures cannot open doors, so 
  shutting doors can be quite valuable. Broken doors cannot be closed. 
  Bashing a door open may break it. Close can take a count, requires a 
  direction, and is affected by the "always_repeat" option.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Jam a Door (</font><font color="#ff9200">j</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or Spike a Door (</font><font color="#ff9200">S</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Many monsters can simply open closed doors, and can eventually get 
  through a locked door. You may therefore occasionally want to jam a 
  door shut with iron spikes. Each spike used on the door will make it 
  harder to bash down the door, up to a certain limit. Smaller monsters 
  are less able to bash down doors. In order to use this command, you 
  must be carrying iron spikes. Jam or Spike requires a direction.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Bash a Door (</font><font color="#ff9200">B</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or Force a Door (</font><font color="#ff9200">f</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command allows you to bash down jammed doors. Your bashing 
  ability increases with strength. Bashing open a door can (briefly) 
  throw you off balance. Doors that are stuck, or which have been 
  jammed closed with spikes can only be opened by bashing, and all 
  closed doors can be bashed open if desired. Bashing a door open may 
  permanently break it so that it can never be closed. Bash or Force 
  can take a count, requires a direction, and is affected by the 
  "always_repeat" option.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disarm a Trap or Chest (</font><font color="#ff9200">D</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You can attempt to disarm traps on the floor or on chests. If you 
  fail, there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off. You can 
  only disarm a trap after you have found it (usually with the Search 
  command). Disarm can take a count, requires a direction, and is 
  affected by the "always_repeat" option.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Alter (</font><font color="#ff9200">+</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select 
  any of the "obvious" commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open, 
  disarm, close), and, by using macros or keymaps, to combine this 
  keypress with directions. In general, this allows the use of the 
  "control" key plus the appropriate "direction" key (including the 
  roguelike direction keys in roguelike mode) as a kind of generic 
  "alter the terrain feature of an adjacent grid" command. Alter can 
  take a count, requires a direction, and is affected by the 
  "always_repeat" option.

<a name="SpellPrayer"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Spell and Prayer Commands

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Browse Magic List (</font><font color="#ff9200">b</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or Peruse Magic List (</font><font color="#ff9200">P</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">All characters which can cast spells can use this command. When this 
  command is used, all of the spells contained in the selected magic 
  are displayed, along with such information as their level, the amount 
  of mana required to cast them, and whether or not you know the spell. 
  And when you select a spell from the list, description text of 
  selected spell will be displayed.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Gain New Spells or Prayers (</font><font color="#ff9200">G</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to actually learn new spells or prayers. When you 
  are able to learn new spells or prayers, the word "Study" will appear 
  in the status area of the screen. If you have a book in your 
  possession, containing spells or prayers which you may learn, then 
  you may choose to study that book. If you are a mage, rogue, or 
  ranger, you may actually choose which spell to study. If you are a 
  priest or paladin, your gods will choose a prayer for you. There are 
  nine books of each type, some normally found only in the dungeon.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Cast a Spell (</font><font color="#ff9200">m</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">To cast a spell, you must have previously learned the spell and must 
  have in your inventory a book from which the spell can be read. Each 
  spell has a chance of failure which starts out fairly large but 
  decreases as you gain levels. If you don't have enough mana to cast a 
  spell, you will be prompted for confirmation. If you decide to go 
  ahead, the chance of failure is greatly increased, and you may lose a 
  point of constitution. Since you must read the spell from a book, you 
  cannot be blind or confused while casting, and there must be some 
  light present.
  
  To pray effectively, you must have previously learned the prayer and 
  must have in your inventory a book from which the prayer can be read. 
  Each prayer has a chance of being ignored which starts out fairly 
  large but decreases as you gain levels. If you don't have enough mana 
  to cast a spell, you will be prompted for confirmation. If you decide 
  to go ahead, the chance of failure is greatly increased, and you may 
  lose a point of constitution. Since you must read the prayer from a 
  book, you cannot be blind or confused while praying, and there must 
  be some light present.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use Bonus Power (</font><font color="#ff9200">U</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">O</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Some races and classes have special natural abilities. For example, a 
  Cyclops may </font><font color="#ff4040">Throw Boulders </font><font color="#ffffff">and a Gnome may </font><font color="#ff4040">Blink </font><font color="#ffffff">away from danger. A 
  Warrior can learn the power of </font><font color="#ff4040">Sword Dancing</font><font color="#ffffff">. Also, it is possible to 
  become mutated and gain a power, such as the ability to shoot </font><font color="#ff4040">Laser 
  Beams </font><font color="#ffffff">from your eyes! (I know, I know ... silliness!). If you have no 
  special powers, then this command will not do anything.


<a name="ObjectManip"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Object Manipulation Commands

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Eat Food (</font><font color="#ff9200">E</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You must eat regularly to prevent starvation. As you grow hungry, a 
  message will appear in the status portion of the screen saying 
  </font><font color="#fffd00">Hungry</font><font color="#ffffff">. If you go hungry long enough, you will become </font><font color="#ff9200">Weak</font><font color="#ffffff">, then 
  start </font><font color="#c00000">Fainting</font><font color="#ffffff">, and eventually, you will die of starvation. You may 
  use this command to eat food in your inventory. Note that you can 
  sometimes find food in the dungeon, but it is not always wise to eat 
  strange food.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Fuel Lantern/Torch (</font><font color="#ff9200">F</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If you are using a torch and have more torches in your pack, or you 
  are using a lantern and have flasks of oil in your pack, then your 
  can refuel them with this command. Torches and Lanterns are limited 
  in their maximal fuel. In general, two flasks will fully fuel a 
  lantern and two torches will fully fuel a torch.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Quaff Potion (</font><font color="#ff9200">q</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to drink a potion. Potions affect the player in 
  various ways, but the effects are not always immediately obvious and 
  are sometimes detrimental.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Read a scroll (</font><font color="#ff9200">r</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to read a scroll. Scroll spells usually have an area 
  effect, except for a few cases where they act on other objects. 
  Reading a scroll causes the parchment to disintegrate as the scroll 
  takes effect. Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be 
  aborted (by pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll 
  before it disintegrates. Note that scrolls must be read carefully as 
  the magical incantations must be pronounced properly for the scroll 
  to work (Magic is fickle). If you are in a hurry (or never bothered 
  to learn to read well), then reading a scroll might fail, usually 
  just when you need it most!
 
  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Inscribe an object (</font><font color="#ff9200">{</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command inscribes a string on an object. The inscription is 
  displayed inside curly braces after the object description. The 
  inscription is limited to the particular object (or pile) and is not 
  automatically transferred to all similar objects. Under certain 
  circumstances, the game will display </font><font color="#ff4040">fake </font><font color="#ffffff">inscriptions on certain 
  objects (e.g., {cursed}, {broken}, {tried}, {empty}, {90% off}) when 
  appropriate. These fake inscriptions are masked by </font><font color="#ff4040">real </font><font color="#ffffff">inscriptions 
  (i.e., those added with this command), but will re-appear if the real 
  inscription is removed. In addition, the game will occasionally place 
  a real inscription on an object for you, normally as the result of 
  your character getting a </font><font color="#ff4040">feeling </font><font color="#ffffff">about the item. All characters will 
  get feelings about weapons and armor after carrying them for a while. 
  Warriors get the most detailed feelings, and get them quicker than 
  any other class. An item labeled as {empty} was found to be out of 
  charges, and an item labeled as {tried} is a flavored item which the 
  character has used, but whose effects are unknown. Certain 
  inscriptions have a meaning to the game, see "@#", "@x#", "!*", and 
  "!x", in the section on inventory object selection.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Uninscribe an object (</font><font color="#ff9200">}</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command removes the inscription on an object. This command will 
  have no effect on "fake" inscriptions added by the game itself.

<a name="MagicalObject"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Magical Object Commands

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Activate Artifact (</font><font color="#ff9200">A</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You have heard rumors of special weapons and armor deep in the 
  dungeon, items that can let you breath fire like a dragon or light 
  rooms with just a thought. Should you ever be lucky enough to find 
  such an item, this command will let you activate its special ability. 
  Special abilities can only be used if you are wearing or wielding the 
  item and they usually take a certain amount of time to </font><font color="#ff4040">recharge</font><font color="#ffffff">.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Aim Wand (</font><font color="#ff9200">a</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or Zap Wand (</font><font color="#ff9200">z</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used. Wands are magical 
  devices, and therefore there is a chance you will not be able to 
  figure out how to use them if you aren't good with magical devices. 
  They will fire a shot that affects the first object or creature 
  encountered or fire a beam that affects anything in a given 
  direction, depending on the wand. An obstruction such as a door or 
  wall will generally stop the effects from traveling any farther. This 
  command requires a direction and can use a target.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use Staff (</font><font color="#ff9200">u</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or Zap Staff (</font><font color="#ff9200">Z</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will use a staff. A staff is normally very similar to a 
  scroll, in that they normally either have an area effect or affect a 
  specific object. Staves are magical devices, and there is a chance 
  you will not be able to figure out how to use them.
 
  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Zap Rod (</font><font color="#ff9200">z</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or Activate Rod (</font><font color="#ff9200">a</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Rods are extremely powerful magical items, which cannot be burnt or 
  shattered, and which can have either staff-like or wand-like effects, 
  but unlike staves and wands, they don't have charges. Instead, they 
  draw on the ambient magical energy to recharge themselves, and 
  therefore can only be activated once every few turns. The recharging 
  time varies depending on the type of rod. This command may require a 
  direction (depending on the type of rod, and whether you are aware of 
  its type) and can use a target.

<a name="ThrowFire"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Throwing and Missile Weapons

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Fire Item (</font><font color="#ff9200">f</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">t</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You may throw any object carried by your character. Depending on the 
  weight, it may travel across the room or drop down beside you. Only 
  one object from a pile will be thrown at a time. Note that throwing 
  an object will often cause it to break, so be careful! If you throw 
  something at a creature, your chances of hitting it are determined by 
  your pluses to hit, your ability at throwing, and the object's pluses 
  to hit. Once the creature is it, the object may or may not do any 
  damage to it. You've heard rumors that some objects found in the 
  dungeon can do huge amounts of damage when thrown, but you're not 
  sure which objects those are.... Note that flasks of oil will do a 
  fairly large chunk of damage to a monster on impact, supposedly 
  representing fire damage, but it works against fire elementals too... 
  If you are wielding a missile launcher compatible with the object you 
  are throwing, then you automatically use the launcher to fire the 
  missile with much higher range, accuracy, and damage, then you would 
  get by just throwing the missile. Fire or Throw requires a direction. 
  Targeting mode (see the next command) can be invoked with "*" at the 
  "Direction?" prompt.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Throw Item (</font><font color="#ff9200">v</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You may throw any object carried by your character. The lighter the 
  object, the farther you can throw it. Only one object from a stack 
  may be thrown at a time. Throwing an object may break it. If you 
  throw something at a monster, your chances of hitting it are 
  determined by your pluses to hit, your ability at throwing, and the 
  object's pluses to hit. If the object hits the monster, it may or may 
  not do damage. Some objects, such as weapons, or flasks of oil, can 
  do a substantial amount of damage. This command requires a direction, 
  and can take a target.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Set Target (</font><font color="#ff9200">*</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This will allow you to aim your spells and such at a specific monster 
  or grid, so that you can point directly towards that monster or grid 
  (even if this is not a "compass" direction) when you are asked for a 
  direction. You can set a target using this command, or you can set a 
  new target at the "Direction?" prompt when appropriate.
  
  At the targeting prompt, you have many options. First of all, 
  targeting mode starts targeting nearby monsters which can be reached 
  by projectable spells and thrown objects. In this mode, you can press 
  </font><font color="#ff9200">t </font><font color="#ffffff">(or </font><font color="#ff9200">5 </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff9200">.</font><font color="#ffffff">) to select the current monster, </font><font color="#ff9200">SPACE </font><font color="#ffffff">to advance to the 
  next monster, </font><font color="#ff9200">- </font><font color="#ffffff">to back up to the previous monster, direction keys to 
  advance to a monster more or less in that direction, </font><font color="#ff9200">r </font><font color="#ffffff">to recall the 
  current monster, </font><font color="#ff9200">q </font><font color="#ffffff">to exit targeting mode, and </font><font color="#ff9200">p </font><font color="#ffffff">(or </font><font color="#ff9200">o</font><font color="#ffffff">) to stop 
  targeting monsters and enter the mode for targeting a location on the 
  floor or in a wall. Note that if there are no nearby monsters, you 
  will automatically enter this mode. Note that hitting </font><font color="#ff9200">o </font><font color="#ffffff">is just like 
  </font><font color="#ff9200">p</font><font color="#ffffff">, except that the location cursor starts on the last examined 
  monster instead of on the player. In this mode, you use the 
  "direction" keys to move around, and the </font><font color="#ff9200">q </font><font color="#ffffff">key to quit, and the </font><font color="#ff9200">t </font><font color="#ffffff">(or 
  </font><font color="#ff9200">5 </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff9200">.</font><font color="#ffffff">) key to target the cursor location. Note that targeting a 
  location is slightly "dangerous", as the target is maintained even if 
  you are far away. To cancel an old target, simply hit </font><font color="#ff9200">* </font><font color="#ffffff">and then 
  </font><font color="#ff9200">ESCAPE </font><font color="#ffffff">(or </font><font color="#ff9200">q</font><font color="#ffffff">).
  
  Note that when you cast a spell or throw an object at the target 
  location, the path chosen is the "optimal" path towards that 
  location, which may or may not be the path you want. Sometimes, by 
  clever choice of a location on the floor for your target, you may be 
  able to convince a thrown object or cast spell to squeeze through a 
  hole or corridor that is blocking direct access to a different grid.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Full screen map (</font><font color="#ff9200">M</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will show a map of the entire dungeon, reduced by a 
  factor of nine, on the screen. Only the major dungeon features will 
  be visible because of the scale, so even some important objects may 
  not show up on the map. This is particularly useful in locating where 
  the stairs are relative to your current position, or for identifying 
  unexplored areas of the dungeon. This command takes no time.

  If object auto-picker/destroyer is set up, specified objects can be 
  displayed in this command, when you press the M, N, K or D. The M 
  displays 'auto-pickup' items, while the N displays 'leave', the K 
  displays 'auto-destroy'. And the D is same as the M plus the N. You 
  can press any other key to quit this map command.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Locate Player on Map (</font><font color="#ff9200">L</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or Where is the Player? (</font><font color="#ff9200">W</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors 
  of the current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point 
  the map will be re-centered on the player if necessary. To scroll the 
  map around, simply press any of the "direction" keys. The top line 
  will display the sector location, and the offset from your current 
  sector. This command takes no time.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Recenter Viewport (</font><font color="#ff9200">^V</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command re-centers the viewport on the player, and is very 
  useful when you approach the edge of the screen. The game will adjust 
  the viewport automatically as you move, but it currently only does so 
  when you approach within 2 squares of the top or bottom, or within 4 
  squares of the left or right. This command is a quicker alternative 
  to the </font><font color="#ffcc80">Locate Player on Map </font><font color="#ffffff">command just discussed.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Look Around (</font><font color="#ff9200">l</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or Examine Things (</font><font color="#ff9200">x</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command is used to look around at nearby monsters (to determine 
  their type and health) and objects (to determine their type). It is 
  also used to find out what objects (if any) are under monsters, and 
  if a monster is currently inside a wall. This command takes no time.
  
  When you are looking at something, you may hit space for more 
  details, or to advance to the next interesting monster or object, or 
  minus ("-") to go back to the previous monster or object, or a 
  direction key to advance to the nearest interesting monster or object 
  (if any) in that general direction, or "r" to recall information 
  about the current monster race, or "q" or escape to stop looking 
  around. You always start out looking at the "nearest" interesting 
  monster or object.

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Inspect Item (</font><font color="#ff9200">I</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command lets you observe a previously *identified* item. This 
  will tell you things about the special powers of the object. 
  Currently, it only makes sense for artifacts and ego-items.

<a name="Help"></a>  </font><font color="#c00000">Help
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Help (</font><font color="#ff9200">?</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Brings up the on-line help system. Note that the help files are 
    just text files in a particular format, and that other help files 
    may be available on the Net. In particular, there are a variety of 
    spoiler files which do not come with the standard distribution. 
    Check the place you got PosChengband from or ask on the newsgroup 
    rec.games.roguelike.angband about them.
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Identify Symbol (</font><font color="#ff9200">/</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to find out what a character stands for. For 
    instance, by pressing "/.", you can find out that the "." symbol 
    stands for a floor spot. When used with a symbol that represents 
    creatures, the this command will tell you only what class of 
    creature the symbol stands for, not give you specific information 
    about a creature you can see. To get that, use the Look command.
    
    There are four special symbols you can use with the Identify Symbol 
    command to access specific parts of your monster memory. Typing 
    Ctrl-A when asked for a symbol will recall details about all 
    monsters, typing Ctrl-U will recall details about all unique 
    monsters, typing Ctrl-N will recall details about all non-unique 
    monsters, and typing Ctrl-M will let you enter a name and recall 
    details about monsters which have the specified name as part of its 
    name.
    
    If the character stands for a creature, you are asked if you want 
    to recall details. If you answer yes, information about the 
    creatures you have encountered with that symbol is shown in the 
    Recall window if available, or on the screen if not. You can also 
    answer "k" to see the list sorted by number of kills, or "p" to see 
    the list sorted by dungeon level the monster is normally found on. 
    Pressing ESCAPE at any point will exit this command.
   
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Game Version (</font><font color="#ff9200">V</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will tell you what version of the game you are using. 
    For more information, see <a href="version.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
<a name="Extra"></a>  </font><font color="#c00000">Extra Commands
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Repeat Last Command (</font><font color="#ff9200">n</font><font color="#ffcc80">) or (</font><font color="#ff9200">X</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command repeats the previously executed command with all its 
    arguments. Very useful to repeat casting, for example, magic 
    missile to same opponent.
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Record Command (</font><font color="#ff9200">"</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Commands that you enter may be recorded to any normal ascii 
    character register. In fact, every command that you manually enter 
    is automatically recorded to the </font><font color="#ff9200">. </font><font color="#ffffff">register. When you repeat the 
    last command, you are really playing back the contents of this 
    special </font><font color="#ff9200">. </font><font color="#ffffff">register. But you can also record the next command to a 
    register of your choosing and then play it back manually later. For 
    example, the command sequence </font><font color="#ff9200">"Fmae*t </font><font color="#ffffff">records the command </font><font color="#ff9200">mae*t </font><font color="#ffffff">to 
    the </font><font color="#ff9200">F </font><font color="#ffffff">register in addition to the </font><font color="#ff9200">. </font><font color="#ffffff">register. You can later play 
    back this command with </font><font color="#ff9200">'F </font><font color="#ffffff">whereas playing back with </font><font color="#ff9200">'. </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff9200">n </font><font color="#ffffff">is only 
    valid on the very next turn.
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Playback Command (</font><font color="#ff9200">'</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">As mentioned above, you may record commands with the </font><font color="#ff9200">" </font><font color="#ffffff">command and 
    play them back later with the </font><font color="#ff9200">' </font><font color="#ffffff">command. Commands are stored in 
    registers, each of which is addressed with a single ASCII 
    character. For example, if you record a command with </font><font color="#ff9200">"t&lt;cmd&gt;</font><font color="#ffffff">, then 
    you may later play it back by pressing </font><font color="#ff9200">'t</font><font color="#ffffff">. These command registers 
    are temporary and will be erased every time you restart the game. 
    To view your recorded commands, choose the </font><font color="#ff9200">' </font><font color="#ffffff">register (i.e., press 
    </font><font color="#ff9200">'' </font><font color="#ffffff">from the top level). You can then enter the register you wish to 
    use (e.g. </font><font color="#ff9200">''t </font><font color="#ffffff">works the same as </font><font color="#ff9200">'t </font><font color="#ffffff">except that the register 
    contents of all recorded commands are displayed to you after you 
    press the second </font><font color="#ff9200">'</font><font color="#ffffff">).
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Toggle Choice Window (</font><font color="#ff9200">^I</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Toggles the display in the choice window (if available) between 
    your inventory and your equipment. This command only applies if you 
    are running PosChengband under a windowing environment and the 
    choice window is available. This also redraws the choice window.
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Redraw Screen (</font><font color="#ff9200">^R</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command adapts to various changes in global options, and 
    redraws all of the windows. This command should be used after 
    changing various global properties (options, attr/char mappings, 
    color definitions, etc). When in doubt, use it.
          
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Create screen dump (</font><font color="#ff9200">)</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command creates a document of the current screen and then 
    displays that document to you in the game's internal file viewer. 
    You may then save the document as either plaintext or as html, 
    using the </font><font color="#ff9200">| </font><font color="#ffffff">command. To create an html file, simply give the file 
    an html extension. Note that if you are playing with graphics 
    enabled, then this command will attempt to convert to normal 
    textual display before creating the screen dump.
  
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Command your pets (</font><font color="#ff9200">p</font><font color="#ffcc80">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">If you have pets then this command allows you to give orders to 
    your pets. You can call them to you, send them out to kill other 
    monsters, dismiss them, and allow/disallow opening of door and 
    picking up items. Your pets will drop all picked up items when you 
    disallow them to pick up anything.
