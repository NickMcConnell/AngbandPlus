<font color="#00ffff">Command Descriptions

</font><font color="#ffffff">The following command descriptions are listed as the command name plus 
the </font><font color="#ff0000">underlying command </font><font color="#ffffff">key. This is followed by the command name and 
</font><font color="#ff0000">roguelike keyset </font><font color="#ffffff">key, if different from the underlying command key. 
Then comes a brief description of the command, including information 
about alternative methods of specifying the command in each keyset, 
when needed.

Several commands (tunnel, disarm, bash, open) are automatically 
repeated as many times as necessary (up to 99) if no specific repeat 
count is given and the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_repeat </font><font color="#ffffff">option has not been turned off. 
Some other commands allow using repeat counts as arguments; for 
example, commands which need a quantity can use the repeat count 
instead of asking for a quantity, allowing the use of </font><font color="#ff8000">0d </font><font color="#ffffff">to drop all. 
Commands which ask for a quantity will convert any letters into the 
maximal legal value.

Press </font><font color="#ff8000">? </font><font color="#ffffff">for commands to use within the help system.

  up to 26 slots in your inventory, not counting equipment slots. 
  Identical objects can often form a "stack" which only occupies a

  the sample below; stacks have a maximum size of 99 objects.

  You can press </font><font color="#ff8000">/ </font><font color="#ffffff">here to toggle between the inventory list, the 
  equipment list and potentially other item inventories like your 
  quiver.
   
  </font><font color="#c08040">Equipment List (</font><font color="#ff8000">e</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to display a list of the objects currently worn or 
  wielded by your character. Your character typically has 13 slots for 
  equipment, each corresponding to a different location on the body; 
  each slot may contain only a single object at a time, and each slot 
  may only contain objects of the proper type. Note that some races 
  (and most monster forms) have body types that differ from the typical 
  humanoid, so the number and types of your equipment slots can vary. 
  Here is a sample equipment list from a human warrior:
  
   a) </font><font color="#c0c0c0">| </font><font color="#ffffff">Right Hand: a Broad Sword (2d6) (+0,+0)               15.0 lb

                                                              </font><font color="#ff0000">48.0 lb   
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Each slot has a descriptive label (like "Right Hand") that determines 
  what type of object it may receive; the right hand and left hand, for 
  example, accept weapons and shields. And yes, you can wield two 
  weapons, or two shields! The slots for most items are very intuitive 
  (gloves go on your hands, helmets go on your head), but some might be 
  a bit surprising, like harps going into the Shooting slot.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Inspect Item (</font><font color="#ff8000">I</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command lets you examine an item in detail, listing whatever 
  special powers of the object you have identified, mentioning if the 
  object still has hidden powers, and noting the item's weight and 
  estimated value. Here too, use </font><font color="#ff8000">/ </font><font color="#ffffff">to toggle between your pack, 
  equipment, and other relevant inventories. This is an especially 
  handy command for artifacts and ego-items.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Get Objects (</font><font color="#ff8000">g</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will get any objects located on the same tile as the 
  player (Mogaminator applies). As a convenience, picking up items does 
  not consume time.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Auto-Get Objects (</font><font color="#ff8000">^G</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will get any objects located on the same tile as the 
  player (Mogaminator applies). In addition, this command will 
  automatically travel to and get other objects in line of sight. With 
  </font><font color="#ff0000">auto_get_objects </font><font color="#ffffff">enabled, any object registered for either 
  auto-pickup or auto-destroy will qualify for automatic get. If that 
  is too much for you (maybe you enjoy cleaning up after battles?), the 
  </font><font color="#ff0000">auto_get_ammo </font><font color="#ffffff">option only applies to objects inscribed with </font><font color="#ff8000">=g</font><font color="#ffffff">; which 
  is typically your ammo, or perhaps spikes on a ninja.
  
  The auto-get travels will terminate when there are no more visible 
  qualifying objects; if your pack becomes full; or if you are 
  disturbed for any reason, such as a nasty dragon waking up and 
  deciding to breathe on you. Auto-get is both safer and more limited 
  than travelling through the object list; auto-get usually only cleans 
  up a single room since the objects must be visible to qualify, while 
  the object list and the </font><font color="#ff8000">H</font><font color="#ffffff">/</font><font color="#ff8000">^E </font><font color="#ffffff">command allow lengthy automatic travels, 
  potentially into harm's way (although these journeys also stop if bad 
  things happen).

  </font><font color="#c08040">Drop Item (</font><font color="#ff8000">d</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the dungeon 
  floor. If the floor spot you are standing on already has an object in 
  it, or rejects object drops altogether (doors, stairs, traps, some 
  terrain types like deep lava), the game will attempt to drop the item 
  onto an adjacent space. If nothing else works, the item will be 
  dropped onto a square that already has an object in it; but be warned 
  that if there simply are no acceptable squares nearby the object may 
  disappear entirely. If the pile selected for dropping contains 
  multiple items, you may specify a quantity.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Destroy Item (</font><font color="#ff8000">k</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">^D</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This destroys an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor. If 
  the selected pile contains multiple objects, you may specify a 
  quantity. You must always verify this command, except in the case of 
  worthless junk items.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Wear/Wield Equipment (</font><font color="#ff8000">w</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">To wear or wield an object, use this command. Since only one object 
  can be in each equipment slot at a time, if you wear or wield an item 
  into a slot which is already occupied, the old item will first be 
  taken off, and may be dropped if there is no room for it in your 
  inventory.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Take Off Equipment (</font><font color="#ff8000">t</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">T</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to take off a piece of equipment and return it to 
  your inventory. If there is no room in your inventory for the item, 
  your pack will overflow and you will drop the item after taking it 
  off. Occasionally, you will run into a cursed item which cannot be 
  removed; these items normally penalize you in some way, and can only 
  be taken off after the curse has been removed.

<a name="Movement"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Movement Commands

  </font><font color="#c08040">Walk (with pickup) (</font><font color="#ff8000">;</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Moves one step in the given direction. The square you are moving into 
  must not be blocked by walls or doors. You will pick up any items in 
  the destination grid if the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_pickup </font><font color="#ffffff">option is set. This command 
  can take a count and requires a direction. You may also use the 
  "original" direction keys (both keysets) or the "roguelike" direction 
  keys (roguelike keyset) to walk in a direction (they are keymapped to 
  this command). If the Mogaminator or the easy auto-destroyer is 
  active, specified objects will be picked up or destroyed.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Walk (flip pickup) (</font><font color="#ff8000">-</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This is just like normal move, except that the "Pick things up" 
  option is inverted. In other words, you will pick things up if and 
  only if </font><font color="#ff0000">always_pickup </font><font color="#ffffff">is </font><font color="#ff0000">not </font><font color="#ffffff">set. This command can take a count and 
  requires a direction. If the Mogaminator or the easy auto-destroyer 
  is active, specified objects will be picked up or destroyed.
  
  This is also the command for deliberately walking into a trap.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Run (</font><font color="#ff8000">.</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">,</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will move in the given direction, following any bends in 
  the corridor, until you either have to make a "choice" between two 
  directions or you are disturbed. You can configure what will disturb 
  you by setting the disturbance options. Run requires a direction. By 
  default </font><font color="#ff8000">Shift+DIR </font><font color="#ffffff">is keymapped to </font><font color="#ff8000">.DIR</font><font color="#ffffff">, although with the original 
  keyset this may run into technical limitations on some platforms. If 
  the Mogaminator or the easy auto-destroyer is active, specified 
  objects will be picked up or destroyed.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Go Up Staircase (</font><font color="#ff8000">&lt;</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Climbs up if you are standing on an up staircase or shaft. In the 
  wilderness, toggles global map mode unless there are alert monsters 
  nearby.
  
  Unless you are playing in </font><font color="#ff0000">coffee-break mode </font><font color="#ffffff">or have activated the 
  ironman_downward option, there is always at least one up staircase on 
  every level. Going up a staircase will take you to either the surface 
  or a new dungeon level. Note that levels are semi-persistent; they 
  can be returned to while you remain in the dungeon (supposing up 
  staircases exist), but are lost forever when you return to surface.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Go Down Staircase (</font><font color="#ff8000">&gt;</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Descends if you are standing on a down staircase or shaft. In the 
  wilderness, returns from global map to local map.
  
  There are always at least two staircases going down on each level, 
  except for quest levels (which have none until the quest monster is 
  killed) and the bottom levels of dungeons. Going down a staircase 
  will take you to a new dungeon level (see "Go Up Staircase" for 
  notes).

  </font><font color="#c08040">Travel to Nearest Interesting Item (</font><font color="#ff8000">H </font><font color="#c08040">or </font><font color="#ff8000">^E</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Locates and automatically travels to the nearest known item that is 
  unidentified, either has not been pseudo-ID'd or has been sensed as 
  an artifact or ego item, is not considered unworthy of picking up by 
  an active Mogaminator, and to which a known route has been mapped. 
  Convenient for quickly locating items you forgot to pick up or 
  identify after you have otherwise a dungeon level, or after killing a 
  high-level monster who dropped loot all over the place.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Resume Journey (</font><font color="#ff8000">J</font><font color="#c08040">) or Resume Travelling (</font><font color="#ff8000">(</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Resumes a previous travel that was interrupted before reaching its 
  target. This command can also be used in the monster and object lists 
  to start a new travel; for this purpose, the </font><font color="#ff8000">J </font><font color="#ffffff">key is also used by 
  the roguelike keyset.

<a name="Resting"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Resting Commands

  </font><font color="#c08040">Stay Still (with pickup) (</font><font color="#ff8000">,</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">.</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Stays in the same square for one move. If you normally pick up 
  objects you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on. 
  This command can take a count. You may also use the "5" key (both 
  keysets). If the Mogaminator or the easy auto-destroyer is active, 
  specified objects will be picked up or destroyed.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Rest (</font><font color="#ff8000">R</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Resting is better for you than repeatedly staying still, and can be 
  told to automatically stop after a certain amount of time, or when 
  various conditions are met. In any case, you always wake up when 
  anything disturbing happens, or when you press any key. This command 
  requests a count if no count is specified; the count defaults to the 
  special value </font><font color="#ff8000">&amp;</font><font color="#ffffff">, which means "rest until fully healed". Another 
  special value, </font><font color="#ff8000">* </font><font color="#ffffff">for "rest to full HP/SP", is also accepted.

<a name="Searching"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Searching Commands

  </font><font color="#c08040">Search (</font><font color="#ff8000">s</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command can be used to locate hidden traps and secret doors in 
  the spaces adjacent to the player. More than a single turn of 
  searching will be required in most cases. You should always search a 
  chest before trying to open it, since they are generally trapped; 
  though if nothing appears, you may have found a rare trapless chest. 
  This command can take a count, which is useful if you are fairly sure 
  of finding something eventually, since the command stops as soon as 
  anything is found.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Toggle Search Mode (</font><font color="#ff8000">S</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">#</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will take you into and out of search mode. When first 
  pressed, the message "Searching" will appear at the bottom of the 
  screen. You are now taking two turns for each command, one for the 
  command and one turn to search. This means that you are taking twice 
  the time to move around the dungeon, and therefore twice the food. 
  Search mode will automatically turn off if you are disturbed. You may 
  also turn off search mode by entering the Search Mode command again.

<a name="Alter"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Alter Commands

  </font><font color="#c08040">Tunnel (</font><font color="#ff8000">T</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">^T</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Tunneling or mining is a very useful art. There are many kinds of 
  rock, with varying hardness, including:
  
    </font><font color="#c08040"># </font><font color="#ffffff">Permanent Rock   Permanent
    # Granite          Very Hard
    % Quartz Veins     Hard
    </font><font color="#808080">% </font><font color="#ffffff">Magma veins      Soft
    : Rubble           Very Soft
  
  Quartz and Magma veins may sometimes contain treasure; known 
  treasures will be displayed as </font><font color="#ff8000">*</font><font color="#ffffff">, but not all treasures are visible 
  without detection. Rubble sometimes covers an object. Tunneling is 
  difficult unless you are wielding a heavy weapon or a digging 
  implement or your Strength is very high. This command can take a 
  count, requires a direction, and is affected by the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_repeat 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">option.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Open a Door or Chest (</font><font color="#ff8000">o</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">To open a chest, you must use this command (for doors, simply walking 
  into a closed door automatically attempts to open it). If the door or 
  chest is locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based on your 
  disarming ability; if you open a trapped chest without disarming the 
  traps first, the traps will be set off. You may need several tries to 
  open a door or chest, and rarely doors will be jammed shut and need 
  to be bashed open. Open can take a count, requires a direction, and 
  is affected by the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_repeat </font><font color="#ffffff">option.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Close a Door (</font><font color="#ff8000">c</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Non-intelligent and some other creatures cannot open doors, so 
  shutting doors can be quite valuable. Broken doors cannot be closed. 
  Bashing a door open may break it. Close can take a count, requires a 
  direction, and is affected by the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_repeat </font><font color="#ffffff">option.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Jam a Door (</font><font color="#ff8000">j</font><font color="#c08040">) or Spike a Door (</font><font color="#ff8000">S</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Many monsters can simply open closed doors, and can eventually get 
  through a locked door. You may therefore occasionally want to jam a 
  door shut with iron spikes. Each spike used on the door will make it 
  harder to bash down the door, up to a certain limit. Smaller monsters 
  are less able to bash down doors. In order to use this command, you 
  must be carrying iron spikes. Jam or Spike requires a direction.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Bash a Door (</font><font color="#ff8000">B</font><font color="#c08040">) or Force a Door (</font><font color="#ff8000">f</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command allows you to bash down jammed doors. Your bashing 
  ability increases with strength. Bashing open a door can (briefly) 
  throw you off balance. Doors that are stuck, or which have been 
  jammed closed with spikes can only be opened by bashing, and all 
  closed doors can be bashed open if desired. Bashing a door open may 
  permanently break it. Bash/Force can take a count, requires a 
  direction, and is affected by the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_repeat </font><font color="#ffffff">option.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Disarm a Trap or Chest (</font><font color="#ff8000">D</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You can attempt to disarm traps on the floor or on chests. If you 
  fail, there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off. You can 
  only disarm a trap after you have found it (with the Search command, 
  by detection, or by previously triggering it). Disarm can take a 
  count, requires a direction, and is affected by the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_repeat 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">option. Walking into known floor traps automatically attempts to 
  disarm them unless the </font><font color="#ff0000">easy_disarm </font><font color="#ffffff">option has been disabled; use </font><font color="#ff8000">- </font><font color="#ffffff">if 
  you wish to deliberately walk into a trap without disarming it.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Alter Adjacent Grid (</font><font color="#ff8000">+</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This all-purpose super-command allows the use of a single keypress to 
  select any of the "obvious" commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, 
  open, disarm, close). </font><font color="#ff8000">Ctrl-[dir] </font><font color="#ffffff">is by default macroed to be 
  equivalent to alter-[dir], in both keysets. Alter can take a count, 
  requires a direction, and is affected by the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_repeat </font><font color="#ffffff">option.

<a name="SpellPrayer"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Spell and Prayer Commands

  </font><font color="#c08040">Browse Magic List (</font><font color="#ff8000">b</font><font color="#c08040">) or Peruse Magic List (</font><font color="#ff8000">P</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">All characters which can cast spells can use this command. When this 
  command is used, all of the spells available to you (or contained in 
  a selected magic book) are displayed, along with such information as 
  their level, the amount of mana required to cast them, and whether or 
  not you know the spell. And when you select a spell from the list, a 
  short description of the selected spell's effect will be displayed.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Gain New Spells or Prayers (</font><font color="#ff8000">G</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to actually learn new spells or prayers. When you 
  are able to learn new spells or prayers, the word </font><font color="#00ffff">Study </font><font color="#ffffff">will appear 
  in the status area of the screen. If you have a book in your 
  possession, containing spells or prayers which you may learn, then 
  you may choose to study that book. If you are a Priest, Paladin, 
  Ranger, Monk or Force-Trainer, your gods will choose a prayer for 
  you; other classes can choose which spell they wish to study, and 
  even study the same spell a second time. There are four books in each 
  realm, some normally found only in the dungeon.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Use a Magic Spell/Mental Power (</font><font color="#ff8000">m</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">To use a book spell (or prayer), you must have previously learned the 
  spell and must have in your inventory a book from which the spell can 
  be read. Each spell has a chance of failure which starts out fairly 
  large but decreases as you gain levels. If you don't have enough mana 
  to cast a spell, you will be prompted for confirmation. If you decide 
  to go ahead, the chance of failure is greatly increased, and you may 
  lose a point of constitution. Since you must read the spell from a 
  book, you cannot be blind or confused while casting, and there must 
  be some light present.
  
  For classes who do not learn book spells but do learn magic or mental 
  powers through other means (commonly just by leveling up), this 
  command may obey slightly different rules. For most (but not all) 
  classes, this command will not work at all if your character is 
  Mundane or has equipped an Anti-Magic item.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Use Bonus Power (</font><font color="#ff8000">U</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">O</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Some races and classes have special natural abilities. For example, a 
  Cyclops may </font><font color="#ff0000">Throw Boulders </font><font color="#ffffff">and a Gnome may </font><font color="#ff0000">Blink </font><font color="#ffffff">away from danger. A 
  Warrior can learn the power of </font><font color="#ff0000">Sword Dancing</font><font color="#ffffff">. Also, it is possible to 
  become mutated and gain a power, such as the ability to shoot </font><font color="#ff0000">Laser 
  Beams </font><font color="#ffffff">from your eyes! If you have no special powers, this command 
  will not do anything.


<a name="ObjectManip"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Object Use Commands

  </font><font color="#c08040">Eat Food (</font><font color="#ff8000">E</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You must eat regularly to prevent starvation. As you grow hungry, a 
  message will appear in the status portion of the screen saying 
  </font><font color="#ffff00">Hungry</font><font color="#ffffff">. If you go hungry long enough, you will become </font><font color="#ff8000">Weak</font><font color="#ffffff">, then 
  start </font><font color="#c00000">Fainting</font><font color="#ffffff">, and eventually starve to death. Use this command to 
  eat food from your inventory - though it is also possible to eat 
  straight from the floor...

  </font><font color="#c08040">Fuel Lantern/Torch (</font><font color="#ff8000">F</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If you are using a torch and have more torches in your pack, or you 
  are using a lantern and have flasks of oil in your pack, you can 
  refuel your light source with this command. Torches and Lanterns have 
  limited fuel capacity; in general, two flasks will fully fuel a 
  lantern and two torches will fully fuel a torch.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Quaff Potion (</font><font color="#ff8000">q</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to drink a potion, fully consuming it unless you are 
  a Potion-speciality Devicemaster. The effects could be good or bad, 
  depending on the potion.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Read Scroll (</font><font color="#ff8000">r</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to read a magic scroll. Reading a scroll causes the 
  parchment to disintegrate as the magic takes effect. Most scrolls 
  which prompt for more information can be aborted (by pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">ESC</font><font color="#ffffff">) 
  without consuming the scroll. Note that magic is fickle, and the 
  scroll must be read with care; mispronounce the incantations, and 
  nothing happens.
 
  </font><font color="#c08040">Activate Item (</font><font color="#ff8000">A</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You have heard rumors of special items deep in the dungeon that let 
  you breathe fire like a dragon or illuminate rooms with just a 
  thought. Should you ever be lucky enough to find such an item, this 
  command will let you activate its special ability. Only equipped 
  items can be activated, and they usually take a certain amount of 
  time to </font><font color="#ff0000">recharge </font><font color="#ffffff">before you can activate them again. Activations 
  resemble scroll, wand, staff and rod effects: all require Magic 
  Device Skill and have a chance to fail.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Aim Wand (</font><font color="#ff8000">a</font><font color="#c08040">) or Zap Wand (</font><font color="#ff8000">z</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command attempts to use a wand. Wand effects are normally bolts, 
  beams, balls or breaths, and so need to be aimed; accordingly, this 
  command requires a direction and can use a target.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Use Staff (</font><font color="#ff8000">u</font><font color="#c08040">) or Zap Staff (</font><font color="#ff8000">Z</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command attempts to use a staff. Staves normally either have an 
  area effect or affect a specific object, and therefore do not need to 
  be aimed.
 
  </font><font color="#c08040">Zap Rod (</font><font color="#ff8000">z</font><font color="#c08040">) or Activate Rod (</font><font color="#ff8000">a</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command attempts to use a rod; rods can have either staff-like 
  or wand-like effects. This command may require a direction (depending 
  on the type of rod, and whether you are aware of its type) and can 
  use a target.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Inscribe an object (</font><font color="#ff8000">Z</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">{</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command inscribes a string on an object. The inscription is 
  displayed inside curly braces after the object description. The 
  inscription is limited to the particular object (or pile) and is not 
  automatically transferred to all similar objects. Certain 
  inscriptions give the game instructions for how to handle or label 
  the item; see <a href="objects.html#Inscriptions"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more information.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Uninscribe an object (</font><font color="#ff8000">}</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command removes the inscription on an object. This command will 
  have no effect on "fake" inscriptions added by the game itself.

<a name="ThrowFire"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Throwing and Missile Weapons

  </font><font color="#c08040">Fire Item (</font><font color="#ff8000">f</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">t</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Fires a selected projectile suitable for your current ranged weapon, 
  provided that you have a ranged weapon equipped. Slings only shoot 
  pebbles and iron shots; bows only shoot arrows; and crossbows only 
  shoot bolts. Projectiles are typically fired from your quiver, but 
  can also be shot directly from your inventory or even from the floor. 
  This command requires a direction, and can take a target.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Throw Item (</font><font color="#ff8000">v</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You may throw any object carried by your character. The lighter the 
  object, the farther you can throw it. Only one object from a stack 
  may be thrown at a time. Thrown objects may or may not damage 
  monsters. Throwing an object can break it. Throwing a potion at a 
  wall always breaks it, potentially causing splash damage. This 
  command requires a direction, and can take a target.

<a name="Targetting"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Set Target (</font><font color="#ff8000">*</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command allows you to aim your spells, arrows and such at a 
  specific monster or grid, even if they are not in one of the eight 
  compass directions; it works both inside and outside direction 
  prompts. This command can also be used as a substitute for the </font><font color="#ff8000">l</font><font color="#ffffff">ook 
  command, which is especially convenient if what you wish to look at 
  is a monster.
  
  The targeting prompt offers many options. The first target offered 
  will be the nearest monster in line of sight, with other monsters in 
  line of sight as alternative targets. Use direction keys to cycle 
  between monsters; </font><font color="#ff8000">+ </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#ff8000">- </font><font color="#ffffff">also work, but are less intuitive.
  
  If you wish to target (or inspect) a square with no monster on it, 
  press </font><font color="#ff8000">p </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff8000">o</font><font color="#ffffff">, switching to a mode where direction keys simply move 
  the cursor. (This mode is automatically entered if no hostile 
  monsters are in line of sight. </font><font color="#ff8000">o </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#ff8000">p </font><font color="#ffffff">are identical except in one 
  respect: pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">p </font><font color="#ffffff">moves the cursor to your own location.) At any 
  time, press </font><font color="#ff8000">5</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff8000">t </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff8000">. </font><font color="#ffffff">to accept the current target, </font><font color="#ff8000">q </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff8000">ESC </font><font color="#ffffff">to exit 
  targeting mode, </font><font color="#ff8000">r </font><font color="#ffffff">to recall lore about a currently targeted monster, 
  </font><font color="#ff8000">x </font><font color="#ffffff">to see all items on the target square, and </font><font color="#ff8000">J</font><font color="#ffffff">/</font><font color="#ff8000">( </font><font color="#ffffff">to select a square 
  as a travel target. See <a href="context_targetting.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more detail.
  
  Note that when you cast a spell or fire an object at a target 
  location, the path chosen is the </font><font color="#ff0000">direct </font><font color="#ffffff">path towards that location, 
  which may or may not be the path you want. Sometimes, by clever 
  choice of a side location as your target, you may be able to aim at 
  squares not directly in line of sight:
    
    Position: an unknown grid [q,t,p,m,x,j,+,-,?,&lt;dir&gt;]

  Note that bolt spells always stop at the first monster in the spell's 
  path, but beam and breath spells affect all squares, and ball spells 
  can reach the target square by flying over monsters' heads if 
  necessary. If the </font><font color="#ff8000">* </font><font color="#ffffff">command is used on the overworld map, it hooks 
  into the similar </font><font color="#ff8000">l</font><font color="#ffffff">ook command. Using the </font><font color="#ff8000">* </font><font color="#ffffff">command consumes no time.

<a name="Looking"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Looking Commands

  </font><font color="#c08040">Display Monster List (</font><font color="#ff8000">Y</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">[</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command displays a list of all monsters currently visible. This 
  is a quick way to tell if there are any uniques or other threatening 
  monsters nearby, and is most commonly used immediately after a summon 
  or detection.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Display Object List (</font><font color="#ff8000">]</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command displays a list of all known objects on the level, as 
  well as other interesting nearby features such as shops or dungeon 
  entrances. Pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">S </font><font color="#ffffff">with the object list active toggles whether 
  stairs are included in the object list. The object list is a handy 
  way to locate stairs, artifacts, unidentified items and other targets 
  of interest on the level, and makes it possible to travel to such 
  targets directly by scrolling down to the target and pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">J</font><font color="#ffffff">.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Full Screen Map (</font><font color="#ff8000">M</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will show a map of the entire dungeon, scaled to fit on 
  a single screen. Only the major dungeon features will be visible 
  because of the scale, so even some important objects may not show up 
  on the map. This is particularly useful for quickly identifying 
  unexplored areas of the dungeon or determining your location relative 
  to the dungeon's edges. This command takes no time.

  If the Mogaminator is active, specified objects can be displayed on 
  this map; this is an obsolete functionality, though, as it is always 
  more convenient to just use the </font><font color="#ff8000">] </font><font color="#ffffff">object list.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Locate Player on Map (</font><font color="#ff8000">L</font><font color="#c08040">) or Where is the Player? (</font><font color="#ff8000">W</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors 
  of the current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point 
  the map will be re-centered on the player if necessary. To scroll the 
  map around, simply press any of the "direction" keys. The top line 
  will display the sector location, and the offset from your current 
  sector. This command takes no time.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Recenter Viewport (</font><font color="#ff8000">^V</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command re-centers the viewport on the player; the game does 
  automatically adjust the viewport as you move, but only when you 
  approach the edge. This command is a quicker alternative to the 
  </font><font color="#c08040">Locate Player on Map </font><font color="#ffffff">command just discussed, though some players go a 
  step further and activate the </font><font color="#ff0000">center_player </font><font color="#ffffff">option (<a href="option.html#center_player"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).

  </font><font color="#c08040">Look Around (</font><font color="#ff8000">l</font><font color="#c08040">) or Examine Things (</font><font color="#ff8000">x</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command is used to look around at nearby monsters (to determine 
  their type and health) and objects (to determine their type). It is 
  also used to find out what objects (if any) are under monsters, and 
  if a monster is currently inside a wall. This command takes no time.
  
  This command is very closely related to the </font><font color="#ff8000">* </font><font color="#ffffff">targeting command, and 
  most of the targeting prompt's special keys also work in the look 
  prompt. It is often convenient to use </font><font color="#ff8000">* </font><font color="#ffffff">instead of this command, 
  especially if you wish to look at a monster; on the other hand, </font><font color="#ff8000">l</font><font color="#ffffff">/</font><font color="#ff8000">x 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">is better for inspecting town buildings.

  </font><font color="#c08040">Repeat Level Feeling (</font><font color="#ff8000">^F</font><font color="#c08040">)

  </font><font color="#c08040">View Previous Messages (</font><font color="#ff8000">^P</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command shows you all the recent messages. You can scroll

  </font><font color="#c08040">Take notes (</font><font color="#ff8000">:</font><font color="#c08040">)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This command allows you to take notes, which will then appear in your 
  message list (prefixed with "Note:"). This command takes no time. It 
  also adds a tiny screenshot to your message log. For example:

    </font><font color="#ffffff">To save your game so that you can return to it later, use this 
    command. Save files will also be generated (hopefully) if the game 
    crashes due to a system error. After you die, you can use your 
    savefile to play again with the same options and lore.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Save (</font><font color="#ff8000">^S</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command saves the game but doesn't exit. Use this frequently 
    if you are paranoid about having the computer crash while you are 
    playing.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Quit (commit suicide) (</font><font color="#ff8000">Q</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Kills your character and exits the game. You will be prompted to

    choice. Note that dead characters are dead forever.

    list.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Interact with Macros (</font><font color="#ff8000">@</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Allows you to interact with macros. You may load or save macros 
    from user pref files, create macros of various types, or define 
    keymaps.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Interact with Visuals (</font><font color="#ff8000">%</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Allows you to interact with visuals. You may load or save visuals 
    from user pref files, or modify the attr/char mappings for the 
    monsters, objects, and terrain features.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Interact with Colors (</font><font color="#ff8000">&amp;</font><font color="#c08040">)

    some systems.
   
    </font><font color="#c08040">Reload Mogaminator Preferences (</font><font color="#ff8000">$</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will reload "pickpref.prf" and 
    "pickpref-&lt;&lt;playername&gt;&gt;.prf" for the Mogaminator; only needs to be 
    used if you have edited these files during the game with an 
    external text editor.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Edit Mogaminator Preferences (</font><font color="#ff8000">_</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Allows you to edit your pickup preferences, and activates the 
    Mogaminator if it was not yet active. The </font><font color="#ff8000">ESC </font><font color="#ffffff">key will open the 
    menu in this editor. You can see and use all edit commands from the 
    command menu. Press </font><font color="#ff8000">^Q </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff8000">^W </font><font color="#ffffff">to quit the editor.
  
<a name="Help"></a>  </font><font color="#c00000">Help
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Help (</font><font color="#ff8000">?</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Brings up the online help system. In some situations (like within 
    the help itself) it may bring up a specific help page.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Identify Symbol (</font><font color="#ff8000">/</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Use this command to find out what a character stands for; for 
    instance, by pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">/. </font><font color="#ffffff">you can find out that the </font><font color="#ff8000">. </font><font color="#ffffff">symbol stands 
    for a floor spot. Note that if you wish to see information about a 
    specific monster nearby, you should use the </font><font color="#ff8000">* </font><font color="#ffffff">command instead of 
    this command.
    
    If you do use Identify Symbol on a monster symbol, you will be 
    reminded of the species corresponding to the symbol and get a list 
    of all monsters of that species that you have seen. Similar 
    information is available through the </font><font color="#ff8000">~ </font><font color="#ffffff">Knowledge Menu.
    
    There are four special commands you can use with Identify Symbol: 
    </font><font color="#ff8000">Ctrl-A </font><font color="#ffffff">to recall all known monsters, </font><font color="#ff8000">Ctrl-U </font><font color="#ffffff">to recall all known 
    uniques, </font><font color="#ff8000">Ctrl-N </font><font color="#ffffff">to recall all known non-uniques and </font><font color="#ff8000">Ctrl-M </font><font color="#ffffff">to 
    recall all known monsters matching a string you type. Press </font><font color="#ff8000">k </font><font color="#ffffff">to 
    sort these lists by number of kills, </font><font color="#ff8000">p </font><font color="#ffffff">to sort them by the native 
    depths of the monsters and </font><font color="#ff8000">ESC </font><font color="#ffffff">to exit.
   
    </font><font color="#c08040">Game Version (</font><font color="#ff8000">V</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command will tell you what version of the game you are using, 
    as well as the current size of the map. For more information, see <a href="version.html">
    </font><font color="#00ff00">[e]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
<a name="Extra"></a>  </font><font color="#c00000">Extra Commands
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Repeat Last Command (</font><font color="#ff8000">n</font><font color="#c08040">) or (</font><font color="#ff8000">X</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command repeats the previously executed command with all its 
    arguments. Very useful for repeatedly firing at or casting the same 
    spell at a given enemy.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Record Command (</font><font color="#ff8000">"</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Commands that you enter may be recorded to any normal ASCII 
    character register. In fact, every command that you manually enter 
    is automatically recorded to the </font><font color="#ff8000">. </font><font color="#ffffff">register. When you repeat the 
    last command, you are really playing back the contents of this 
    special </font><font color="#ff8000">. </font><font color="#ffffff">register. But you can also record the next command to a 
    register of your choosing and then play it back manually later; for 
    example, the command sequence </font><font color="#ff8000">"Fmae*t </font><font color="#ffffff">records the command </font><font color="#ff8000">mae*t </font><font color="#ffffff">to 
    the </font><font color="#ff8000">F </font><font color="#ffffff">register in addition to the </font><font color="#ff8000">. </font><font color="#ffffff">register. You can later play 
    back this command with </font><font color="#ff8000">'F </font><font color="#ffffff">whereas playing back with </font><font color="#ff8000">'. </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff8000">n </font><font color="#ffffff">is only 
    valid on the very next turn.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Playback Command (</font><font color="#ff8000">'</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">As mentioned above, you may record commands with the </font><font color="#ff8000">" </font><font color="#ffffff">command and 
    play them back later with the </font><font color="#ff8000">' </font><font color="#ffffff">command. Commands are stored in 
    registers, each of which is addressed with a single ASCII 
    character. For example, if you record a command with </font><font color="#ff8000">"t&lt;cmd&gt;</font><font color="#ffffff">, then 
    you may later play it back by pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">'t</font><font color="#ffffff">. These command registers 
    are temporary and will be erased every time you restart the game. 
    To view your recorded commands, choose the </font><font color="#ff8000">' </font><font color="#ffffff">register (i.e., press 
    </font><font color="#ff8000">'' </font><font color="#ffffff">from the top level). You can then enter the register you wish to 
    use (e.g. </font><font color="#ff8000">''t </font><font color="#ffffff">works the same as </font><font color="#ff8000">'t </font><font color="#ffffff">except that the register 
    contents of all recorded commands are displayed to you after you 
    press the second </font><font color="#ff8000">'</font><font color="#ffffff">).
    
    The playback command is rarely used, as macros and keymaps (<a href="pref.html#Macros"></font><font color="#00ff00">[f]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">) 
    are usually preferable.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Toggle Choice Window (</font><font color="#ff8000">^I</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Toggles subwindow display between your inventory and your 
    equipment. This command only applies if you have an 
    inventory/equipment subwindow.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Redraw Screen (</font><font color="#ff8000">^R</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command adapts to various changes in global options, and 
    redraws all of the windows. It is polite to use this command if 
    somebody starts watching your game when you play on </font><font color="#ff0000">angband.live</font><font color="#ffffff">; 
    also use this command if you feel there are graphical errors or the 
    game has not properly responded to visual changes you made. When in 
    doubt, use it.
          
    </font><font color="#c08040">Create screen dump (</font><font color="#ff8000">)</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">This command creates a document of the current screen and then 
    displays that document to you in the game's internal file viewer. 
    You may then save the document as either plaintext or as html, 
    using the </font><font color="#ff8000">| </font><font color="#ffffff">command. To create an html file, simply give the file 
    an html extension. Note that if you are playing with graphics 
    enabled, then this command will attempt to convert to normal 
    textual display before creating the screen dump.
  
    </font><font color="#c08040">Command your pets (</font><font color="#ff8000">p</font><font color="#c08040">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">If you have pets, use this command to give orders or toggle pet 
    options. See <a href="monster.html#PetCommands"></font><font color="#00ff00">[g]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for details.
