<font color="#00c8ff">User Preferences

</font><font color="#ffffff">PosChengband allows you to change various aspects of the game to suit 
your tastes. You may define keymaps (changing the way your keypresses 
are mapped to underlying commands), create macros (allowing you to map 
a single keypress to a series of keypresses), modify the visuals 
(allowing you to change the appearance of monsters, objects, or terrain 
features), change the colors (allowing you to make a given color 
brighter, darker, or even completely different), or set options 
(turning them off or on).

<a name="Files"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Preference Files

</font><font color="#ffffff">There are two types of preference files: system preferences and user 
preferences. The former represent the default display and input options 
while the latter are optional customizations that you may add to 
override the default settings. System preference files, such as 
pref.prf, are usually stored in /lib/pref relative to the installation 
(e.g., on Windows, if you installed in C:\games\PosChengband then the 
system pref files may be found in C:\games\PosChengband\lib\pref). User 
preference files, on the other hand, are stored in the user directory, 
which is /lib/user on Windows, relative to the install location, and 
perhaps (though this is customizable), ~/.angband/PosChengband on 
Linux. In general, the location of user files is platform dependent, 
and can vary depending on how you configure and install the game.

During initialization, the system preference file pref.prf is loaded, 
and this file directs the loading of other preference files, such as 
pref-key.prf for keyboard mappings and pref-opt.prf for default option 
settings. Then, system preference files for visuals are loaded starting 
with font.prf for normal ASCII display and graf.prf for those weird 
graphics users. Each of these system preference files will redirect to 
another file depending on which platform you are playing (e.g. 
font-win.prf on Windows).

Finally, once your character has been born or loaded, the game then 
tries to load the following user preference files:
  </font><font color="#00ff00">user.prf
  user-$SYS.prf
  $RACE.prf
  $CLASS.prf
  $PLAYER.prf
</font><font color="#ffffff">Here, $SYS is the 3 character system code for you platform, such as win 
for the Windows port, or gcu for the Curses port. $RACE is your current 
character's race, $CLASS the class name, and $PLAYER the character's 
actual name, unless it contains illegal characters for your file system 
(e.g, naming your player </font><font color="#ff9200">Mr. *WONDER* </font><font color="#ffffff">is probably a bad idea). User 
preference files are loaded last so that you may override system 
preferences with your own settings. We'll discuss some examples below.

Preference files consist of a list of commands which are parsed to 
configure various options. These are discussed next.

<a name="Commands"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Preference Commands

</font><font color="#ffffff">There are many commands for setting preferences. I'd rather not 
document them all, since, hopefully, you would never need to use them 
directly. Just keep in mind that the game has its own syntax for 
processing pref files, and, should you ever be curious or inclined to 
investigate, you can learn them by browsing existing pref files or 
looking at the source code. I'll give one example in the next section, 
and then we will discuss setting up preferences using the user 
interface commands which are designed to hide the details of the syntax 
from you.

<a name="Example"></a></font><font color="#c00000">An Example

</font><font color="#ffffff">In this example, fire up the game in ASCII display and load your 
character. My character is imaginatively named </font><font color="#ff4040">Test</font><font color="#ffffff">, so when I refer to 
Test.prf later on, you'll know to mentally change that filename to 
whatever your character happens to be named.

For this example, we will be directly entering a single user preference 
command. To do this, we use the special </font><font color="#ff4040">Enter a user pref command 
</font><font color="#ffffff">command which is available with the </font><font color="#ff9200">! </font><font color="#ffffff">key. This requires us to know the 
exact syntax of the preference command we want, as well as the internal 
numeric code for various values. It is an advanced command, and 
normally you will want to use one of the friendlier in-game commands 
(for visuals, in this case) instead.

I find @ so boring to look at. Let's use </font><font color="#fffd00">@ </font><font color="#ffffff">instead! To make this 
change, type </font><font color="#ff9200">! </font><font color="#ffffff">then enter </font><font color="#ff9200">R:0:11:@</font><font color="#ffffff">. The </font><font color="#ff9200">R </font><font color="#ffffff">preference command is used to 
set display values for monster races (which, as you may know, are 
defined in /lib/edit/r_info.txt). The game uses the special 0'th entry 
in the monster race table as the display options for the player. That 
we entered </font><font color="#ff9200">R:0 </font><font color="#ffffff">says we wish to override this value. The next field is 
the attribute to use. Since we are in ASCII text mode, we need to enter 
a value of 0 to 15 for one of the available 16 colors. I picked 11 for 
yellow. Finally, we keep the @ for the character for this monster race. 
After entering this command, you'll notice the player is still a plain 
old @. Type </font><font color="#ff9200">^R </font><font color="#ffffff">to force a redraw, and now you should be proudly 
displayed as </font><font color="#fffd00">@</font><font color="#ffffff">.

If we were to restart the game at this point, our change would be lost. 
We'll discuss the </font><font color="#ff4040">Interact with Visuals </font><font color="#ffffff">command in just a moment, but 
for now, just blindly press </font><font color="#ff9200">% </font><font color="#ffffff">followed by </font><font color="#ff9200">1 </font><font color="#ffffff">to dump the current monster 
race visuals to a user preference file. I get the file Test.prf listed 
as the default (remember, my character is actually named Test). You 
should keep this $NAME.prf suggestion since, as I'm sure you remember, 
this is one of the files the game tries to automatically load during 
initialization. Keeping this value ensures our changes get 
automatically used the next time we play this character! So press </font><font color="#ff9200">ENTER 
</font><font color="#ffffff">to actually dump your preferences.

Go ahead and restart the game in ASCII mode to confirm the change 
persists. Now, restart the game in graphics mode and what do you see? 
For me, on Linux, I get graphics for objects and terrain features, but 
all of the monsters are displayed in ASCII. (On Windows, you might need 
to restart, turn on graphics, and then restart again ... I can't 
confirm this just now). That's because the we dumped the monster 
visuals while in text mode, and the game didn't just dump the one entry 
we changed: It dumped them all! Let's go ahead and call this a feature: 
If you ever wanted to play in a mixed-mode with graphical terrain but 
craved the nostalgia of ASCII monsters, well, there you go! You can do 
this.

One final comment: You may edit the Test.prf file you dumped directly, 
or you may delete it. Since this was an example, you probably just want 
to delete it, but you should know that the game stores all user 
preferences for your current character here (by default), and this 
includes any macros you might have defined. You can also get rid of the 
ASCII monsters (assuming you want to play in graphics mode) by choosing 
</font><font color="#ff9200">% </font><font color="#ffffff">and then choosing the option to </font><font color="#ff4040">Reset Visuals</font><font color="#ffffff">, followed by re-dumping 
monster visual settings in you $NAME.prf file. That's fine too, and 
we'll discuss interacting with visuals through the user-interface in 
detail in the next section.

<a name="Visuals"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Interacting with Visuals (</font><font color="#ff9200">%</font><font color="#c00000">)

</font><font color="#ffffff">Now, you may have found the need to type in a cryptic instruction like 
</font><font color="#ff9200">R:0:11:@ </font><font color="#ffffff">rather disgusting. If so, you can relax: There is an easier 
way. Let us repeat the change from the previous section using the user 
interface command to interact with visuals. Press </font><font color="#ff9200">% </font><font color="#ffffff">and then choose the 
menu option for changing a monster attribute in visual mode (currently, 
this is </font><font color="#ff9200">7 </font><font color="#ffffff">and, for the purposes of the present discussion, your player 
is a monster!). What do you see?

Well, I guess this is one way to see all the uniques in the game! I'll 
assume if you are brave enough to be reading this topic than you are 
already an advanced player and know the uniques. Anyway, the left area 
of the display gives various monster groups, and the right shows how 
the monsters in the current group look. Go ahead and move down the list 
of groups, all the way to the very last one. Once you select the group 
called Player, hit the right arrow to move into the list of "monsters" 
for this group, and select the one also called Player. That is you! 
Your screen should look something like:

</font><font color="#ffffff">&lt;dir&gt;, ENTER to accept, 'c' to copy, ESC

You cannot tell from the screenshot, but I moved the cursor down to the 
yellow @, since this is the display we setup manually in the last 
section. If you look at the top line, you see </font><font color="#00c8ff">0b/40 </font><font color="#ffffff">which is 
hexadecimal for 11 (which is yellow) and the ascii character code for 
@. Go ahead and choose </font><font color="#ff9200">ENTER </font><font color="#ffffff">to accept the change.

All of this accomplished the same change as </font><font color="#ff9200">! </font><font color="#ffffff">followed by </font><font color="#ff9200">R:0:11:@ 
</font><font color="#ffffff">which we did in the last section. It's quite a bit more work, but you 
can see what your change will be as you make it, so it is easier to do 
things correctly. If you repeat this in graphics mode, you'll find that 
it is actually much more convenient to use the user interface to setup 
and change visuals.

When you want to keep your changes, you use the option to dump monster 
visuals, just like before. I'll let you work through the other visual 
options, both in text mode and in graphics mode, since the process to 
make changes is the same. You can configure not just monster visuals, 
but objects and terrain features as well. Be sure to dump your changes 
so they are remembered for this character.

<a name="Colors"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Interacting with Colors (</font><font color="#ff9200">&amp;</font><font color="#c00000">)

</font><font color="#ffffff">This option allows you to configure the basic colors used by the game. 
However, this option will not work on all systems. For example, the 
Curses port uses the console's current profile rather than the in-game 
color table, so setting colors through the game will not work (Instead, 
edit the current profile for your console, or switch to a different 
profile). Furthermore, while the UI is pretty easy to figure out, it is 
rather painful to use in practice since there are commands to increase 
or decrease the respective r, g and b values of the current color table 
entry. But there is no option to just type in a desired value. Here, I 
recommend you use the option to dump colors to your $NAME.prf file, and 
then close the game and manually edit the rgb values in your favorite 
text editor, using whatever visual color tools your are available on 
your operating system. At some point, we should really fix up this 
command to be more friendly!

<a name="Options"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Interacting with Options (</font><font color="#ff9200">=</font><font color="#c00000">)

</font><font color="#ffffff">The various game options are documented elsewhere (see <a href="option.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">). Here, I'll 
just mention that there exist two preference commands for turning 
options on and off. You may use </font><font color="#ff9200">Y:option_name </font><font color="#ffffff">to turn an option on and 
</font><font color="#ff9200">X:option_name </font><font color="#ffffff">to turn it off (Use the </font><font color="#ff9200">! </font><font color="#ffffff">option, or embed this 
preference command inside a macro as discussed below). Obviously, 
replace option_name with the exact name for the option you wish to 
configure. The list of internal option names is documented in the 
previous link.

    </font><font color="#00ff00">Note: </font><font color="#ffffff">You cannot alter cheating options with the user 
    pref commands X or Y. Nor can you configure these 
    options in the </font><font color="#ff4040">pref-opt.prf </font><font color="#ffffff">system preference file. To 
    cheat, you need to to enable the </font><font color="#ff4040">allow_debug_opts </font><font color="#ffffff">and 
    then set the option through the user interface. This 
    will mark your character as a cheater, though!

<a name="Macros"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Interacting with Macros (</font><font color="#ff9200">@</font><font color="#c00000">)

</font><font color="#ffffff">The "Interact with macros" command allows you to define or remove 
"macros", which are mappings from a single logical keypress to a 
sequence of keypresses, allowing you to use special keys on the 
keyboard, such as function keys or keypad keys, possibly in conjunction 
with modifier keys, to "automate" repetitive multi-keypress commands 
that you use a lot.

Since macros represent keypress sequences, and not all keypresses have 
a printable representation, macro triggers and actions must often be 
"encoded" into a human readable form. This is done using several types 
of encoding, including "\xHH" for character number HH in hexadecimal, 
"\e" for the "escape" code, "\n" for the "newline" code, "\r" for the 
"return" code, "\s" for the "space" code, "\\" for backslash, "\^" for 
caret, and "^X" for the code for any "control" key "ctrl-X".

In PosChengband, name of special keys as macro-trigger is displayed 
using its real name, for example the Control-key plus the F1-key is 
displayed as "\[control-F2]", and the Alt-key plus the G is displayed 
as "\[Alt-G]". In other variant these special keys will be, currently, 
displayed using its key-code.

Note that the "action" of a macro will not be checked against other 
macro triggers, so you cannot make infinite loops. You may specify 
extremely long macros, but you are limited in length by the underlying 
input mechanisms, which in general limit you to about 1024 keys in both 
triggers and actions.

The special "\" command (which must be encoded in macros as "\\") is 
very useful in macros, since it bypasses all keymaps and allows the 
next keystroke to be considered a command in the underlying 
PosChengband command set. For a list of the PosChengband command set, 
see the "command.txt" help file. For example, a macro which maps 
Shift-KP6 to "\" + "." + "6" will induce the "run east" behavior, 
regardless of what keyset the user has chosen, and regardless of what 
keymaps have been defined.

Macros can be specified in user pref files as a pair of lines, one of 
the form "A:&lt;str&gt;", which defines the encoded macro action, and one of 
the form "P:&lt;str&gt;", which defines the encoded macro trigger.

The "Interact with macros" command also allows you to define "keymaps", 
which are vaguely related to macros. A keymap maps a single keypress to 
a series of keypresses, which bypass both other keymaps and any macros. 
PosChengband uses keymaps to map the original and the roguelike keysets 
to the underlying command set, and allows the user to modify or add 
keymaps of their own. Note that all keymap actions must be specified 
using underlying commands, not keypresses from the original or 
roguelike keysets. The original keyset is almost identical to the 
underlying keyset, except that "numbers" are mapped to ";" plus a 
direction, "5" is mapped to ",", and a few control-keys are mapped to 
various things. See "command.txt" for the full set of underlying 
commands. Some uses for keymaps include the ability to "disable" a 
command by mapping it to "\x00".

Keymaps can be specified in user pref files as pairs of lines of the 
form "A:&lt;str&gt;" "C:&lt;T&gt;:&lt;key&gt;", where &lt;str&gt; is the encoded keymap action, 
&lt;T&gt; is the keyset (0 for original and 1 for roguelike), &lt;key&gt; is the 
encoded trigger key.

<a name="MacroSamples"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Some Macro Examples

</font><font color="#ffffff">You may now forget about keymaps and pretend that macros are things 
that allow you, the user, to bind a sequence of commands to a single 
keystroke. Here are some of my personal examples:

</font><font color="#00ff00">Example #1: Archery
</font><font color="#ffffff">Inscribe @f1=g on your primary ammo, and then add the macro sequence 
*tf1 to your favorite key (I like to use -). This will automatically 
target the nearest opponent and fire the inscribed ammo. The =g part of 
the inscription allows you to automatically pick up any unbroken 
projectiles once the battle is over. (This assumes that use_old_target 
is turned on, which it is by default. Otherwise, you'll need to work 
out for yourself the altered macro action).

</font><font color="#00ff00">Example #2: Resting
</font><font color="#ffffff">Add the macro sequence R&amp;\r to a convenient key (I use F1 for this). 
Normally, resting requires 3 keystrokes and it is frustrating when your 
resting gets constantly interrupted. Pressing F1 reduces this annoyance 
by a factor of 3.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Example #3: Tunneling
</font><font color="#ffffff">Inscribe your wand of stone to mud with @am and then bind the macro 
sequence *\eam to your favorite key. Perhaps the only disadvantage of 
the use_old_target option occurs when you are done fighting, and want 
to something else like clear away some rubble. This macro first 
dismisses the old target with *\e and then aims your inscribed wand of 
stone to mud. You will be prompted for the desired direction.

</font><font color="#ffffff">Inscribe @ui on your staff of identify (The one with 50+ charges) and 
then bind ui* to your favorite knowledge key. Use this macro once your 
pack has filled up with unkown, but pseudo-identified objects.
