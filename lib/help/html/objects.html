<font color="#00c8ff">Objects

</font><font color="#ffffff">Objects are one of the most important elements in the game, and much of 
your effort will be devoted to getting better, and then even better, 
stuff. Whether they are potions to heal you during a difficult fight, 
scrolls to teleport you out of danger, armor to protect you from fire 
breathing dragons, or swords to slay the minions of evil, objects 
permeate every aspect of your journey from the safety of town to the 
halls of Oberon and finally to the lair of the dreaded Serpent of 
Chaos. Naked, you are nothing. Well equipped, and perhaps, just maybe, 
you will stand a chance.

There are various types of objects, each with its own symbol for 
display, and generally with its own command for use. These will be 
described fully in the reference section near the end of this document. 
For now, here is an informal introduction.

First, there are objects you may wield or wear as equipment. This 
includes melee weapons such as swords, axes, polearms (pikes, spears, 
glaives) and hafted weapons (flails, hammers, maces); armor such as 
suits of chain mail, shields, helmets, cloaks, gloves and boots; 
jewelry such as rings and amulets; and finally light sources, such as 
torches and lanterns. All of these sorts of objects must be equipped 
with the </font><font color="#ff9200">w </font><font color="#ffffff">command to wield or wear them. For much of the game, you 
will be trying to find better and better gear to wear: more deadly 
weapons, more protective armor, magic rings and artifacts of rare and 
mighty enchantments. Whatever you have at the moment, no matter how 
good, you can be relatively sure that something even better could be 
found if only you were lucky, or bold, enough to find it.

Next, there are objects you carry around in your pack for utility 
purposes, or as provisions. Of course, you need to eat: killing stuff 
is hard work! And so food is a staple of the well prepared adventurer. 
And, equally obvious, you need to be able to see in those dark, dank 
places where evil lurks, so you need oil to refuel your lantern, or 
spare torches should your current one run out. But even more that this, 
you will need magical objects to survive. These include spellbooks, if 
you are playing a magical class, scrolls which all but the stupidest 
may read, potions which any may drink, and magical devices. Potions, 
scrolls and magical devices (wands, rods and staves) each contain a 
single magical spell or effect which they may perform. Generally, these 
can be quite useful, such as healing you in a pinch, or teleporting you 
out of danger. Or they might be offensive powers (for devices) that 
destroy your enemies. Or the effects may be bad, placed there to thwart 
adventurers at the outset of their journies, just when they are the 
most vulnerable and most easily dispatched.

Finally, there is gold or treasure. If you are a dwarf, you will barely 
resist singing of your longing for the lost, ancient treasures of yore. 
Other players will find these objects just as useful, for gold is the 
currency of the realm, accepted by shopkeepers the whole world over. 
You can dig for gold, but don't lose sight of the real purpose of your 
quest: The enemies lie deeper, ever deeper. And should you linger too 
long in the shallow safety, their forces may grow to the point where 
none may challenge them.

Now, it is time to explain all you will need to know about objects 
during your adventures. We will begin with how you get objects, then 
discuss how you learn about their powers, and finally discuss how to 
use them. At the end, we will give a table of all the types of objects 
you might encounter, at a broad level. This is a helpfile, and not a 
spoiler page, so we won't be telling you all the objects that exist, 
and will scarcely even mention the artifacts and other excellent items 
you are likely to encounter ... should you survive long enough.

<a name="Acquisition"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Where Can I Get More Stuff?

</font><font color="#ffffff">Every player is born with a few objects to get them started on their 
quest. Exactly what these objects are depends upon which class they are 
playing. For example, Warriors begin with a sword and some nice armor, 
while Mages begin with their starting spellbooks and a pitiful looking 
dagger. But every player starts with a small amount of gold as well. 
Since the game begins in town, the first place to look for stuff is in 
the various shops.

Each store in town sells a particular class of objects, from weapons 
and bows at the Weapon Smiths, to shields and suits of armor at the 
Armory, to spellbooks, wands and staves at the Magic Shop. And then 
there is the Black Market, an unregulated forum to buy and sell just 
about any object imaginable, but at highly exorbitant prices. Often, 
you can simply buy a really great object here, but you need to be quite 
rich indeed!

So shopping is the first place you will find new stuff. But you are on 
a quest, after all, and it is time to begin your adventures. And it is 
in the various dungeons of the world that the best treasures can be 
found (Where do you think the Black Market gets all its stuff, after 
all?). If you are lucky, or stealthy, you can find quite a few objects 
just laying on the ground in the various dungeon levels you explore. 
How did they get there? Perhaps they were dropped by other adventurers 
who no longer found them useful? Or perhaps, noticing the various 
skeletons lying about, you realize they once belonged to other 
adventurers like yourself? At any rate, there are not that many objects 
just laying about anyways, and truly good objects won't be left lying 
around for long. For, players are not the only creatures with a lust 
for treasure, and monsters too, have a taste for gold.

Many monsters you meet will be carrying one or more items about their 
person which you may retrieve from their corpse should you be skillful 
enough to defeat them. You may pick up objects by moving on top of them 
and using the </font><font color="#ff9200">g</font><font color="#ffffff">et command. By setting various options (see <a href="option.html#UserInterface"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">) you may 
choose to pick up items automatically or to be prompted before picking 
up objects. There is also a powerful, rule based object management 
system called The Mogaminator that you may want to learn about later in 
the game. This system allows you to more easily manage all the objects 
you encounter, either by destroying objects you have registered as 
junk, or by picking up objects you have registered as desirable (see <a href="editor.html">
</font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">). In your quest to defeat The Serpent, should you succeed, you will 
likely find tens of thousands of objects along the way and it is nice 
to have an efficient, automatic way to deal with them.

Finally, perhaps the best way to get really good objects is to find a 
treasure vault. There are many types of vaults, and they are usually 
well guarded, both with traps and with monsters. The better the 
treasure, the more difficult it will be for you to defeat the guardian 
monsters, and many a brave adventurer learned too late that bravery, if 
foolish, can be deadly as well. (Of course, vaults can be burgled as 
well, as any hobbit can tell you).

<a name="Knowledge"></a></font><font color="#c00000">OK, I Found Something. What Does It Do?

</font><font color="#ffffff">When you find an object, you won't know much about it. For example, you 
might find a "long sword (2d5)" (see the section on weapons below for 
an explanation of the 2d5). Here, you know the type of object, that it 
is a weapon, and that tells you that you can wield it, if so inclined. 
And since you've seen long swords before (they are quite common), you 
know roughly how deadly the average long sword is. But, is this one any 
good? Is it magical? Cursed? What other bonuses might it have? This 
object is what we call </font><font color="#ff4040">Unidentified</font><font color="#ffffff">, and you will usually want to learn 
more about it before deciding to use it, or even carry it about with 
you as you continue to explore (It is a bit heavy, after all).

Every character will eventually get a sense of the quality of 
unidentified objects in their pack. This ability is called </font><font color="#ff4040">Pseudo-ID 
</font><font color="#ffffff">and its speed (i.e., how long it takes to kick in) and strength (i.e., 
how much information it reveals) will depend upon your class and your 
wisdom. Early in the game, pseudo-id is your first line of defense 
against the onslaught of junk objects. Pick stuff up, wait a bit (while 
continuing to play, of course), and learn which objects are junk and 
which might be worthy of further investigation. See <a href="objects.html#Pseudo-ID"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">in the 
reference section below for more information about pseudo-id.

If you sense that an object might be useful, you will probably want to 
Identify the object. This requires magic to do, either as a spell if 
you are a Mage, or as an effect from a magical device such as a scroll 
or perhaps a staff. In the former case, you can afford to be less 
selective in the objects you identify, since you can always rest to 
regain mana, and then recast the spell as needed. In fact, as a Mage, 
you can often just identify everything you find, as you find it, and 
skip the potentially long wait for (not to mention the hassle of) 
pseudo-id. But for everybody else, it will usually require a scroll of 
identify to learn about an object. These are available in town, and are 
generally quite common. Still, they are not so common (or cheap) that 
you can afford to waste them on every object you find. You need to be a 
bit more selective than that!

Identifying an object reveals its full name, as well as its more 
obvious bonuses. This includes combat bonuses in accuracy and 
deadliness as well as armor bonuses in protectiveness (i.e., AC). The 
object's name tells you whether it is an ego item or even an artifact, 
and also (usually) tells you if the object is cursed or not. But 
Identify doesn't tell you everything about an object.

For excellent and special objects, you will need to learn their powers. 
You may do so by equipping and using the object (but you won't want to 
wield cursed items unless you have some means of removing the curse). 
Some magical attributes will be obvious, and you will learn these 
simply by wearing the item. For example, the item might increase your 
strength, and you will feel yourself 'bulk up' when you put it on. 
Other attributes will take longer to learn. For example, a weapon might 
slay orcs, and you will need to actually hit an orc with the weapon to 
discover this. Or, a piece of armor might grant resistance to fire, and 
you'll need to get hit with a fire ball or breath before learning this 
fact. Eventually, through sheer tenacity and perseverance, you can 
learn everything about an object this way! However, this method can 
take some time, and, especially as the game progresses, you won't want 
to spend this much effort learning each object you find. In this case, 
there are two other means of learning about objects: *Identify* and 
selling. The first is a magical power, available as a spell, scroll or 
town service, and is rather expensive or rare. But it instantly and 
completely reveals everything about a given item, so is quite useful. 
The second method is to simply sell an item in town. After the sale, 
you can examine the item in the shop's inventory to see what it does. 
Of course, if you make a mistake with this method and sell something 
truly useful, you'll need to buy the item back. Make sure you have some 
gold!

Object Knowledge and Object Quality are related concepts (You gain 
kowledge about an object's quality). We've been discussing knowledge, 
so now it is time to turn our attention to quality.

<a name="Quality"></a></font><font color="#c00000">How Good is this Object, Anyway?

</font><font color="#ffffff">The broad quality of a wearable object (i.e., equipment) is given by 
the strong version of psuedo-id. Objects are, in increasing/decreasing 
order of quality, one of average, good/bad, excellent/awful or 
special/terrible. What does this mean?

If you did some shopping, then you probably saw what average equipment 
looks like. For example, the Weapon Smiths might have inventory like 
the following:

          Fasgul (Zombie)                         Weapon Smiths (30000)

Here, we see a bunch of different types of weapons, each of which is 
fully *Identified* (Objects in the town shops are always automatically 
*Identified*). But, they don't look very impressive! First of all, you 
can notice that each type of weapon has different damage dice, which 
means nothing more than that, for example, a 3d4 Bastard Sword is more 
deadly than a 1d7 Cutlass, since 3d4 (which means roll three four-sided 
dice) will give an average of 7.5 damage per strike, while 1d7 (which 
means roll a single seven-sided die, if such a thing could be 
imagined!) gives an average of 4 damage per strike. Each class of 
weapon has its own damage dice.

Next, you may notice that (+0,+0) is repeated over and over again. 
That's because all of these objects are </font><font color="#ff4040">average</font><font color="#ffffff">. Hey, the Weapon Smith 
is no wizard. He just forges weapons of average quality, but he might 
occasionally buy a magical weapon from some intrepid adventurer (like 
yourself!). The (+0,+0) simply gives the magical bonus to melee 
accuracy (the first number), which affects your ability to hit a 
monster with that weapon, and the magical bonus to damage (the second 
number), which gets added to the damage total rolled by the damage 
dice, should you actually land a blow with that weapon.

Objects can be magically enhanced, at which point they become </font><font color="#ff4040">good 
</font><font color="#ffffff">objects. This means nothing more than that (+0,+0) becomes something 
non-zero, giving you bonuses either to hit, or to damage, or both. For 
example, you might have noticed that </font><font color="#c86400">Short Bow (x3) (+3,+6)</font><font color="#ffffff">. The (x3) 
is part of every average bow, and is called the </font><font color="#ff4040">damage multiplier</font><font color="#ffffff">. 
We'll discuss its meaning later when we discuss archery. But bows too 
have </font><font color="#ff4040">combat bonuses </font><font color="#ffffff">just like melee weapons, and they mean the same 
thing. Here, the bow gives +3 to hit (making you more skilled with 
archery), and +6 to damage (making you more deadly as well). That would 
be a nice starting bow to have, but, alas, it costs 1540 gp which is 
more than I have.

So, we've discussed average and good objects. What about excellent 
objects? And special objects? Excellent objects are called </font><font color="#ff4040">ego items</font><font color="#ffffff">, a 
term that has been around for a long time but whose origin I cannot 
guess. Let's just say they are magical objects of a certain broad 
class. For example, I'll break my normal rules about spoilers, and say 
that there exists an ego class of weapons of Slay Orc. They aren't 
particularly good ego items, so I haven't completely ruined the game by 
mentioning them (I hope). They are simply more deadly against orcs. For 
example, our 3d4 Bastard Sword, were it a weapon of slay orc, would do 
three times as much damage from the base damage roll against orcs. In 
other words, roll a four-sided die three times, add up the result, and 
multiply by three if the monster is an orc. Then add in the bonus to 
damage. This illustrates that ego weapons often give targetted slays 
that make the weapon more deadly against a certain class of monsters. 
Ego items in general can do lots of things, like boost your stats, give 
you resistances or other important abilities, or even activate for 
various magical effects.

Ego items, as I said, come as a single instance of a broad class of 
objects, each of which will have the same set of bonuses, and perhaps a 
random bonus as well just to keep egos interesting. In this respect, 
they behave like flavored objects (discussed in the next section). 
Initially, your character will not know anything about the various ego 
item types (even if *you* do, though some obvious ones like Slay Orc 
are known to all right off the bat). Instead, the character needs to 
*identify* an instance of a particular ego type in order to become 
aware of that type, learning the stock bonuses shared by all objects of 
that ego type (but not the random bonuses). So *identify* is an 
important way to learn the various ego types, and you usually only need 
to do it on the first one you find. (This is one case where selling an 
object to learn its ego type is actually a useful strategy, provided 
you don't think you would otherwise want the object).

</font><font color="#ff4040">Special </font><font color="#ffffff">objects are artifacts. Think of these as unique super-ego 
objects: You can only find them once in a particular game and they tend 
to be substantially more powerful than ordinary ego items. Like egos, 
they typically give bonuses to combat as well as slays (if they are a 
weapon), or bonuses to armor class and resistances (if they are armor) 
as well as possible bonuses to your stats and other abilities. You will 
generally want to *identify* every artifact you find, unless you happen 
to be a veteran player who has already memorized all of the artifacts. 
But even then, like egos, artifacts sometimes common with additional 
random bonuses like an extra resistance, or an extra ability. 
*Identify* is your friend.

Finally, we've talked about the good end of the spectrum (average -&gt; 
good -&gt; excellent -&gt; special). What about the evil end of the spectrum 
(average -&gt; bad -&gt; awful -&gt; terrible)? These objects are </font><font color="#ff4040">cursed</font><font color="#ffffff">, but 
they need not be junk. Unlike other variants, cursed objects work a 
little differently in this game. Well, bad objects are just the 
opposite of good ones, so they really are junk most of the time. But 
awful objects are excellent items (i.e., ego items) that happen to have 
some bad attributes added in as well. And terrible items are special 
items (i.e., artifacts) that similarly add bad attributes on top of the 
good. Whether or not these items remain useful is up to you to decide, 
since they always blend good attributes with bad attributes. Sometimes 
they are junk, and other times the good outweighs the bad. In either 
case, you will need *identify* to discover this information. Oh, and 
cursed items also usually have a </font><font color="#ff4040">gotcha </font><font color="#ffffff">mechanic, that I suppose I 
better not mention. I'll just caution you to be careful around cursed 
objects.

We've talked a lot about equipment, but what about other kinds of 
objects? Their quality too might vary. Let's discuss some of these 
other object types first.

<a name="Flavors"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Object Flavors

</font><font color="#ffffff">Some objects come in </font><font color="#ff4040">flavors</font><font color="#ffffff">. For example, you might find a Black 
Spotted mushroom, or a Bubbling potion. The description of the 
unidentified object is termed its flavor, and all objects of a given 
kind have the same flavor for the duration of a given game. For 
example, that Black Spotted mushroom might cause hallucinations, as 
some mushrooms have been known to do. Next time you find a Black 
Spotted mushroom, you will know to avoid it since it too will cause 
hallucinations. But the flavors </font><font color="#ff4040">shuffle </font><font color="#ffffff">each game you play. If they 
didn't then once you learned the flavor of hallucination mushrooms in 
one game, you'd know it for all time, and where would the fun be in 
that?

Currently, the only flavored objects are mushrooms, potions and scrolls 
(We used to have more, including rings, amulets, wands, rods and 
staves, but I've waged a sort of mini-crusade against flavors for a 
number of reasons which I won't discuss). Each instance of a flavor is 
exactly like every other instance of the flavor, and typically, you 
only need Identify to learn the flavor (though you can also try to use 
the object to learn what it is ... This can be risky!). You won't find 
</font><font color="#ff4040">good </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">excellent </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">special </font><font color="#ffffff">objects here. Each instance of a flavor is 
exactly like every other instance. The early game is heavily dominated 
by learning many, many different flavors of marginally useful or even 
downright useless objects. This is one reason for junk management tools 
like The Mogaminator.

<a name="Jewelry"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Jewelry

</font><font color="#ffffff">While rings and amulets are wearable objects, they behave a little bit 
differently than weapons and armor. For one thing, there is no such 
thing as </font><font color="#ff4040">good </font><font color="#ffffff">jewelry. Either an item is average (in which case you 
might consider it junk, unless you plan on reforging artifacts later in 
the game) or it is excellent/awful. Excellent rings and amulets are 
like ordinary ego items in that they are instances of a broad class: 
the ego type. However, they are a bit different in that the ego type 
determines the theme of the object: its set of allowed attributes. But 
each piece of jewelry is almost entirely random, generated with one or 
more attributes from the allowed set. This means the quality of the 
item is highly variable, and generally increases the deeper you 
descend.

Another difference with jewelry is that you won't find random 
artifacts. Instead, there are a small number of fixed standard 
artifacts available. However, the various ego types can become 
amazingly powerful so you don't really need artifacts here. And given 
the themed nature of the egos, they are really behaving like 
mini-rand-arts anyway.

<a name="Lore"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Object Lore

</font><font color="#ffffff">We've been discussing the magical bonuses provided by excellent and 
special items (egos and artifacts). To review, you will need to learn 
the bonuses of each item as you find it. Your pseudo-id will reveal the 
object's quality at a very coarse level and is generally used to 
determine which objects are worthy of further investigation. 
Identifying an object reveals its basic attributes ... what you would 
see for an average or good item in the town shops. This includes combat 
bonuses on weapons and armor class bonuses on armor. In addition, 
Identify reveals the object's </font><font color="#ff4040">name</font><font color="#ffffff">. For ego items, this is the name of 
the ego type, such as a </font><font color="#ff4040">Long Sword of Slaying</font><font color="#ffffff">. For artifacts, this is 
the unique name of the artifact. But, aside from this, </font><font color="#ff4040">Identify </font><font color="#ffffff">won't 
tell you what the object actually does. And most excellent and special 
items have magical bonuses, so you'll need to learn these.

We discussed three ways to learn the magical bonuses of a wearable 
item. First, you can equip the item (but don't try this if the item is 
cursed!). This will immediately reveal many aspects of the item's 
power, including stat and skill bonuses. But it won't reveal a weapon's 
extra slays, or an armor's extra resistances. It won't reveal many 
hidden bonuses like </font><font color="#ff4040">Free Action </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff4040">See Invisible</font><font color="#ffffff">. For all of these, you 
will need to experience the bonus while using the item. For example, if 
your weapon slays orcs, then you will learn this once you hit an orc 
with it. Or, if it grants Free Action, then you will learn this the 
next time a Floating Eye gazes upon you with its paralysis effect. And 
so on. Over time, you can learn all of the objects powers ... if you 
are patient enough. For less patient players, however, the second 
method of learning an object's bonuses is </font><font color="#ff4040">*Identify*</font><font color="#ffffff">, either through a 
scroll, a spell or a town service. This power instantly reveals all the 
object's attributes and is very convenient. Unfortunately, at least in 
the early game, it is a bit expensive. So, the third way of learning 
about an object is to sell it. But, then you no longer have the object, 
do you?

This brings us to the concept of </font><font color="#ff4040">Object Lore</font><font color="#ffffff">. You see, not only are you 
learning attributes of an individual object, you are also learning 
about the underlying artifact or ego item. And the next time you find 
this artifact (that would be in another game using this savefile, since 
artifacts are unique) or the next time you find an instance of this ego 
item, you will be aware of attributes you learned before. Simply 
identifying the object will reveal object powers that you have already 
learned. Over time, the need for </font><font color="#ff4040">*Identify* </font><font color="#ffffff">wanes. Play several 
characters using the same savefile, and you will see the benefits!

You can always view your current artifact and ego lore while playing. 
Simply use the knowledge command (</font><font color="#ff9200">~</font><font color="#ffffff">) and choose the option for 
artifacts or egos. Find the item you are interested in and use the 
recall command (</font><font color="#ff9200">r</font><font color="#ffffff">) to view the details. For example:

Like </font><font color="#ff4040">Monster Lore</font><font color="#ffffff">, object lore is stored in your savefile and will be 
passed down to any new characters you create with this file. If you 
want to build up a large stock of lore, make sure you use the same 
savefile for each game you play.

<a name="Devices"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Devices

</font><font color="#ffffff">Magical devices include wands, staves and rods. I highly recommend you 
head on over to the Magic Store and e</font><font color="#ff9200">x</font><font color="#ffffff">amine a few to get a feel for how 
devices work, as this area of the game has been extensively modified 
for the current release (4.0).

Since these are available in town, I'll talk you through one example in 
detail without much of a guilty conscience over spoilers. For example, 
I examined the following wand:

</font><font color="#00c000">a Wand: </font><font color="#00ff00">Stinking Cloud
  </font><font color="#ffcc80">This device has the following magical strength:
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Power  : </font><font color="#00ff00">13
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Mana   : </font><font color="#fffd00">10</font><font color="#ffffff">/</font><font color="#00ff00">39

  </font><font color="#ffcc80">This device is loaded with a spell:
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Spell  : </font><font color="#00c8ff">Stinking Cloud
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Info   : dam 15
  Level  : </font><font color="#00ff00">8
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Cost   : </font><font color="#00ff00">4
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Charges: </font><font color="#fffd00">2</font><font color="#ffffff">/</font><font color="#00ff00">9
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Fail   : </font><font color="#00ff00">2.4%
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Desc   : It fires a ball of poison.

It will help a little bit if you are already familiar with spellcasters 
and the magic system, since the best way to think of devices is as 
spellcasters that may cast a single spell. The device has a casting 
level (labelled as </font><font color="#ff4040">Power</font><font color="#ffffff">) and </font><font color="#ff4040">Mana</font><font color="#ffffff">, just like a normal spellcaster. And 
the single spell they are loaded with has a </font><font color="#ff4040">spell level </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#ff4040">casting 
cost </font><font color="#ffffff">just like normal spells.

The </font><font color="#ff4040">Power </font><font color="#ffffff">of the device determines how much mana it can have as well as 
which spells it can "learn". A device cannot have a spell whose level 
exceeds its power. The power of the device also determines the strength 
of the spell when it is cast. For example, if the spell does damage, 
then the amount of damage will be determined solely based upon the 
power of the device, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the level of 
the player (This is a change!).

The </font><font color="#ff4040">Mana </font><font color="#ffffff">of the device determines how many times it can cast the spell 
before "resting". Traditionally, this has been displayed as </font><font color="#ff4040">Charges </font><font color="#ffffff">on 
the device, and you can work out the number of available charges by 
dividing the remaining mana by the casting cost of the spell (and work 
out the total number of charges by dividing the total mana by the 
casting cost of the spell). That's right: Every time you use a device, 
its mana is decreased by the casting cost of the spell. Once a device's 
mana is exhausted, it will no longer be able to cast its spell, but you 
need not chuck the object as junk at this point. For mana actually 
regenerates! Sure, it regenerates very slowly on wands and staves (and 
about ten times faster on rods), but it does regenerate. And this is a 
good thing too because the mechanism of recharging has been 
dramatically changed. These changes should be obvious as you play, but 
I'll just say here that a device's intrinsic regeneration is the normal 
way to recover charges, while recharging a device (through a spell or a 
scroll) is typically only desirable in the heat of battle.

Finally, there is the </font><font color="#ff4040">Fail Rate </font><font color="#ffffff">of the device. Unlike the power of the 
effect, the fail rate has much to do with the intelligence and magical 
skill of the player. The greater the spell level, the more difficult 
the device is to use. Only the truly magical will be able to master the 
most powerful devices.

We had previously been discussing object quality (egos and such), so it 
is worth mentioning that excellent devices do exist (And who knows? 
Perhaps even special ones as well by the time you are reading this!). 
I'm not sure about cursed devices, though. None of my spies have 
reported back to me on this matter, which is a little bit puzzling 
since thus far, I have seemed to be well informed.

<a name="Spellbooks"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Spellbooks

</font><font color="#ffffff">Most spellcasters need spellbooks in order to learn and cast spells. 
These objects do not require identification, and each type of spellbook 
is exactly the same. There are no issues of object knowledge or quality 
with regard to spellbooks! See <a href="magic.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more on the magic system.

<a name="Inscriptions"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Object Inscriptions

</font><font color="#ffffff">This is an advanced topic which may want to skip for now. However, 
inscriptions are very powerful and useful, so you should come back to 
this topic eventually.

Inscriptions are nothing more than text messages that annotate 
individual objects. The game uses inscriptions on an object to 
communicate information to you, and you can use inscriptions to either 
communicate back to the game (more on this in a minute), or to simply 
take notes about an object for your own future reference. For example, 
some players like to document where they found a given object, or who 
dropped it. You are free to type any information you like inside an 
object inscription.

To add an inscription, use the </font><font color="#ff9200">{ </font><font color="#ffffff">command, then type whatever you like. 
If you later decide to remove that inscription, use the </font><font color="#ff9200">}</font><font color="#ffffff">. Note that 
inscriptions are displayed to you inside curly braces as {my 
inscription}, so the inscription commands themselves should be easy to 
remember.

Adding your own inscription on an object can override some of the fake 
inscriptions added by the game to communicate information to you, such 
as an object's discount when purchasing it in the town. In other 
instances, your inscription will be combined with whatever the game has 
to say about this object.

  </font><font color="#ff9200">Automatic Inscriptions
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">These are fake inscriptions, added by the game, to communicate 
  information to the player. For example, we've already talked about 
  pseudo-id as an ability to discover the general quality of an object. 
  This information is displayed to the player in the object's 
  inscription. For example, you might get a message like "You have a 
  Long Sword (5d5) {special}" where the inscription is displayed 
  between curly braces, and gives the pseudo-identification of this 
  object as being an artifact. We say these inscriptions are "fake" 
  because they are automatically added by the game and not typed in by 
  the player. Automatic inscriptions include the following:
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Type             Comment
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Pseudo-ID        Displays the quality of the object as average, good, 
                   excellent, etc. These inscriptions will be removed 
                   once the player identifies the object.
  Discount         If an item is purchased at a discount, this fake 
                   inscription displays that discount. If you find this 
                   annoying (as I do), you can turn it off with the <a href="option.html#show_discounts"></font><font color="#00ff00">[e]</a> 
                   </font><font color="#ffffff">show_discounts option.
  Abbreviations    If you enable the <a href="option.html#abbrev_all"></font><font color="#00ff00">[f]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">abbrev_all or <a href="option.html#abbrev_extra"></font><font color="#00ff00">[g]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">abbrev_extra 
                   options, or if you inscribe {%all} or {%} 
                   (respectively) on an object, then the known 
                   resistance, powers, slays and bonuses of an object 
                   will be displayed automatically as part of its 
                   inscription. This is a very useful feature. The 
                   meaning of the various abbreviations is given in the<a href="objects.html#InscriptionAbbrev"> 
                   </font><font color="#00ff00">[h]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">reference table at the end of this document.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Useful Inscriptions
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Player inscriptions are those you type in yourself, using the </font><font color="#ff9200">{ 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">command to inscribe an object. These inscriptions can be any text you 
  like, perhaps just a note to yourself to remind you where you found a 
  given object. Alternatively, you may type in one of several useful 
  forms to communicate your preferences to the game. Let's call these 
  </font><font color="#ff4040">useful inscriptions</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  By far, the most useful use of the useful inscriptions (sorry :) is 
  to control object selection when entering a given command. For 
  example, when a Mage goes to cast a spell (using the </font><font color="#ff9200">m </font><font color="#ffffff">command), they 
  are prompted for a spellbook, which they must select from their 
  inventory. By default, this choice is made by the letter 
  corresponding to that particular slot in the player's inventory. For 
  example:
  
  (Inven: a-d,'(',')', ESC) Use which book?
   a) </font><font color="#ff4040">? a Chaos Spellbook [Sign of Chaos]
   </font><font color="#ffffff">b) </font><font color="#ff4040">? a Chaos Spellbook [Chaos Mastery]
   </font><font color="#ffffff">c) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Beginner's Handbook]
   </font><font color="#ffffff">d) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Master Sorcerer's Handbook]
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">I only have 4 spellbooks at the moment, so this choice is not too 
  bad. But let's say I get very used to casting spells from my [Chaos 
  Mastery] book with something like </font><font color="#ff9200">mbe</font><font color="#ffffff">, where </font><font color="#ff9200">e </font><font color="#ffffff">corresponds to a 
  particular spell in that book. Now, along comes an arch-vile who 
  burns up one of my books, perhaps my [Sign of Chaos]. Now, the prompt 
  for a spellbook looks like:
  
  (Inven: a-d,'(',')', ESC) Use which book?
   a) </font><font color="#ff4040">? a Chaos Spellbook [Chaos Mastery]
   </font><font color="#ffffff">b) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Beginner's Handbook]
   </font><font color="#ffffff">c) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Master Sorcerer's Handbook]
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If I fail to notice that the letters for my books changed, or if I am 
  so darned used to typing </font><font color="#ff9200">mbe </font><font color="#ffffff">for the spell I want, or if I built 
  macros for the spells I want, then, in all of these cases, I am in 
  for a nasty surprise. Instead of casting the spell I want from [Chaos 
  Mastery], I'll be casting something else entirely from my [Beginner's 
  Handbook]!
  
  This type of reordering happens with all kinds of objects. Your 
  inventory sorts itself as you find stuff, and objects move around. As 
  they move, the letters you enter to select them move around as well. 
  To deal with these situations, use the special inscription of the 
  form: @</font><font color="#00ff00">Command-Letter</font><font color="#ff4040">Choice-Letter</font><font color="#ffffff">. For example, perhaps I should try 
  adding @mb to my [Chaos Mastery]? And to illustrate a point, I will 
  actually inscribe it with "Master of @mb Chaos" (The point being that 
  @mb just needs to be part of the inscription, not the entire 
  inscription). Now, here is what I see:
  
  (Inven: a-c,'(',')', ESC) Use which book?
   b) </font><font color="#ff4040">? a Chaos Spellbook [Chaos Mastery] {Master of @mb Chaos}
    </font><font color="#ffffff">) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Beginner's Handbook]
   </font><font color="#ffffff">c) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Master Sorcerer's Handbook]
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">See? It worked! Well, not quite, since I have another spellbook in my 
  inventory that is currently occupying the b) slot: my [Beginner's 
  Handbook]. And now, it looks like I cannot use that book at all! This 
  illustrates an important principle with regard to spellbooks: If you 
  use inscriptions for one spellbook, you should use them for all 
  spellbooks. Most players use @ma through @md for their first realm of 
  magic (each realm has four spellbooks) and @me through @mh for their 
  second realm. Other players use @m1 through @m8 instead. Let's follow 
  the first of these guidelines:
  
  (Inven: a-c,'(',')', ESC) Use which book?
   b) </font><font color="#ff4040">? a Chaos Spellbook [Chaos Mastery] {Master of @mb Chaos}
   </font><font color="#ffffff">e) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Beginner's Handbook] {@me}
   </font><font color="#ffffff">f) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Master Sorcerer's Handbook] {@mf}
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">That's better. My inventory, you remember, still looks like this:
  
  Inventory: carrying 31.2 pounds (36% of capacity). Command:
   a) </font><font color="#ff4040">? a Chaos Spellbook [Chaos Mastery] {Master of @mb Chaos}
   </font><font color="#ffffff">b) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Beginner's Handbook] {@me}
   </font><font color="#ffffff">c) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Master Sorcerer's Handbook] {@mf}
   </font><font color="#ffffff">d) </font><font color="#ffcc80">, 9 Rations of Food
   </font><font color="#ffffff">e) </font><font color="#c86400">~ </font><font color="#fffd00">4 Wooden Torches (with 3500 turns of light)
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">All we are doing is using inscriptions to change the lettering of 
  choices, and then, only for the </font><font color="#ff9200">m </font><font color="#ffffff">command. If I </font><font color="#ff9200">b</font><font color="#ffffff">rowse my spellbooks, 
  I am back in my original situation. Of course, I can rectify this by 
  appending inscriptions of the form @ba through @bh on all of my 
  books, or, since I rarely use the browse command, I can simply slow 
  down and read the prompt, making sure to pick the correct letter each 
  time. But there is another option.
  
  Instead of using the form @</font><font color="#00ff00">Command-Letter</font><font color="#ff4040">Choice-Letter</font><font color="#ffffff">, I can use the 
  form @</font><font color="#ff4040">Choice-Digit </font><font color="#ffffff">where the digit is a single digit between 0 and 9. 
  For example, I could inscribe my books with @1 through @8:
  
  (Inven: a-d,'(',')', ESC) Use which book?
   a) </font><font color="#ff4040">? a Chaos Spellbook [Sign of Chaos] {@1}
   </font><font color="#ffffff">b) </font><font color="#ff4040">? a Chaos Spellbook [Chaos Mastery] {@2}
   </font><font color="#ffffff">c) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Beginner's Handbook] {@5}
   </font><font color="#ffffff">d) </font><font color="#00c8ff">? a Sorcery Spellbook [Master Sorcerer's Handbook] {@6}
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Now, I can cast my desired spell with </font><font color="#ff9200">m2e</font><font color="#ffffff">, browse my [Master 
  Sorcerer's Handbook] with </font><font color="#ff9200">b6 </font><font color="#ffffff">and gain a new spell in my [Sign of 
  Chaos] with </font><font color="#ff9200">G1</font><font color="#ffffff">. All of this works, even though the user interface 
  display is showing letters for the choice options. The displayed 
  letters also work, but they are subject to change as my inventory 
  shuffles about. The numbers, on the other hand, will never change, 
  and will also work with all commands (even commands like </font><font color="#ff9200">d6 </font><font color="#ffffff">will 
  work, dropping, in this case, my [Master Sorcerer's Handbook]). After 
  writing these last few paragraphs, I decided I need to start using 
  the @1 through @8 approach! It so much easier :)
  
  Controlling object selection letters is not the only useful 
  inscription. You can also have the game prompt for confirmation when 
  attempting to use an object with a given command. For example, 
  suppose you just found </font><font color="#00c8ff">a Potion of Super-Duper Healing</font><font color="#ffffff">, and you 
  really want to make sure you do not quaff it by mistake. After all, 
  we've just spent quite a bit of time discussing how objects in your 
  pack jump about, switching slots at the earliest opportunity. (My 
  favorite is when you pick up an object and the game tells you what 
  slot it goes to, but then immediately re-shuffles your pack putting 
  the object some place else. That one gets me every time!) Anyway, to 
  protect this potion from accidental quaffing, add the inscription !q, 
  which is of the form !</font><font color="#00ff00">Command-Letter</font><font color="#ffffff">. Now, whenever I try to </font><font color="#ff9200">q</font><font color="#ffffff">uaff 
  the potion, either accidentally or intentionally, the game will 
  prompt me for confirmation. If I am paranoid, and can increase the 
  prompting with the inscription !q!q or even, !q!q!q!q. The game will 
  prompt once for each !q in the inscription and you can make sure, 
  even super-duper sure, that you don't use an object by mistake. 
  Finally, you can use the inscription !* which uses the wild-card 
  command letter to have the game prompt you for every command that 
  uses the object. In this example, I'll get prompted if I try to 
  destroy or drop the potion in addition to trying to quaff it. It is 
  as if I inscribed !q!d!k, except that !* is also handling other 
  things I can't think of just now (like !s for selling). We cater to 
  the most paranoid of players!
  
  So we have @</font><font color="#00ff00">Command-Letter</font><font color="#ff4040">Choice-Letter </font><font color="#ffffff">as well as @</font><font color="#ff4040">Choice-Digit </font><font color="#ffffff">to 
  control object selection; and !</font><font color="#00ff00">Command-Letter </font><font color="#ffffff">to add confirmation 
  prompts before using an object in various ways. What else can we do? 
  Quite a bit actually. Try the following:
  
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Inscription  Meaning
      </font><font color="#ffffff">!!       Disturb the player when the inscribed object (typically 
               a magical device), is fully recharged. This means you 
               can issue a long rest command like </font><font color="#ff9200">R777\r </font><font color="#ffffff">to rest for 
               777 turns, and the game will interrupt your dozing once 
               your device is ready for use again (unless it still 
               hasn't finished recharging, which is a real possibility 
               I guess).
      =g       Automatically pick this object up. Use this on your 
               arrows and such, and you can quickly regather discharged 
               ammunition after a lengthy shooting battle.
      .        Suppress the prompt for random teleportation on objects 
               with this attribute.
      $        Suppress the warning prompt for items than warn you 
               before taking dangerous actions. Of course, this defeats 
               the warning altogether, but sometimes you are confident 
               enough in your own decision making to forgo this second 
               guessing by pretentious jewelry you might be wearing.
     %all      Automatically add a fake inscription revealing all of 
               this objects known resistances, bonuses, abilities and 
               slays. If you like this, don't use the inscription 
               approach, but simply enable the <a href="option.html#abbrev_all"></font><font color="#00ff00">[i]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">abbrev_all option.
      %        Automatically add a fake inscription revealing all of

               and slays. If you like this, don't use the inscription 
               approach, but simply enable the <a href="option.html#abbrev_extra"></font><font color="#00ff00">[j]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">abbrev_extra option.
  
  Finally, there is also an special inscription form ^</font><font color="#00ff00">Command-Letter</font><font color="#ffffff">. 
  Adding this form to a worn piece of equipment causes the game to 
  prompt for verification every time you attempt the indicated command, 
  even if the command is one not involving the object in question. This 
  is weird, but if you like, you could inscribe ^&lt;^&gt; on your boots, 
  say, and the game will now prompt for confirmation everytime you 
  attempt to use the </font><font color="#ff9200">&lt; </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#ff9200">&gt; </font><font color="#ffffff">commands, even though these commands do 
  not involve your boots! (This kind of feature is affectionately 
  referred to by programmers as a </font><font color="#ff4040">hack</font><font color="#ffffff">).

</font><font color="#ffffff">Many monsters have unique body types, and adapting to different 
equipment possibilities is part of the fun of playing as a monster!

<a name="Inventory"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Inventory or Pack

</font><font color="#ffffff">Unlike Equipment, every player has an identical pack for carrying a 
small, fixed number of objects. You can place any object you like in 
your pack, and objects here will sort and stack as allowed. However, 
should your pack grow too heavy, your character will become </font><font color="#ff4040">encumbered 
</font><font color="#ffffff">and will gradually move slower and slower. View your equipment with the 
</font><font color="#ff9200">e</font><font color="#ffffff">quipment command, and your inventory with the </font><font color="#ff9200">i</font><font color="#ffffff">nventory command. Add 
objects to your pack with the </font><font color="#ff9200">g</font><font color="#ffffff">et command and equip objects for use 
with the </font><font color="#ff9200">w</font><font color="#ffffff">ear command. You can remove an equipped object with the </font><font color="#ff9200">t</font><font color="#ffffff">ake 
off command, and discard an item with either the </font><font color="#ff9200">d</font><font color="#ffffff">rop command, which 
places the item on the ground, or the </font><font color="#ff9200">k </font><font color="#ffffff">command, which destroys the 
object (if possible).

<a name="Pseudo-ID"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Pseudo-ID

</font><font color="#ffffff">To review, pseudo-id is the ability to get a rough idea of the quality 
of objects you carry in your pack (or wield, if you are truly 
intrepid!). The speed and strength of the sensing varies with class, 
wisdom, and virtue of the player. Also, once a player reaches CL35, 
they automatically sense the quality of objects underfoot, and this 
automatic sensing is always strong regardless of class. So pseudo-id is 
really only relevant in the early to mid-game.

Pseudo-id communicates the quality of an object via a fake inscription 
on that object. For example, you might have a Long Sword (2d5) 
{excellent} or Hard Studded Leather [7] {terrible}. The meaning of 
these adjectives depends on whether the sensing is strong or weak, and 
is given in the following two tables.
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Table 1 - Strong Pseudo-Id
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Inscription    Meaning
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Terrible       a cursed artifact
  Awful          a cursed ego item
  Bad            a cursed nameless item
  Average        an average item
  Good           an enchanted item
  Excellent      a good ego item
  Special        an non-cursed artifact
  
  Or, to put this another way:
  
                     </font><font color="#00ff00">Egos         Artifacts
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Average -&gt; Good -&gt; Excellent -&gt; Special
          -&gt; Bad  -&gt; Awful     -&gt; Terrible
  
  
  </font><font color="#ff9200">Table 2 - Weak Pseudo-Id
  </font><font color="#00ff00">Inscription    Meaning
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Average        an average item
  Cursed         a cursed item (includes cursed ego items and 
                 artifacts)
  Enchanted      an enchanted item (includes good ego items and 
                 artifacts)

evil and grants ESP demons as well. (Quick Quiz: Which item is it?)
