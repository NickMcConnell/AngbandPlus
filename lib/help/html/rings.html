</font><font color="#c00000">Getting Started

</font><font color="#ffffff">Lacking any direct melee attacks and any means of movement, the ring's 
first order of business is to lure a suitable ring bearer. To achieve 
this, there are two approaches. First, the most powerful means, and the 
one available to the ring at the very start of their adventuring is to 
lie still and look enticing! This is the essence of mimicry, and 
monsters will generally think the player is a ring unless the player 
does something to reveal its true nature (such has launching a magic 
missile or otherwise damaging a visible monster). The second means of 
acquiring a ring bearer only comes later in the game, and should only 
be used once a monster has perceived the ring for what it truly is 
(viz., a sentient and malicious magical creature that seeks to dominate 
its wielder).

So the initial approach is to lure a ring bearer and hope he/she picks 
the ring up. But what if their are no suitable monsters about? Here, 
the ring possesses a very special power called Glitter (available with 
the 'U' key). This power is much like resting: The ring simply waits 
until a monster comes near. However, while glittering, potential ring 
bearers sense something magical nearby, and will approach out of 
curiousity. So don't worry. Simply lie still and be patient. Monsters 
will come to you!

Once a suitable ring bearer approaches, you will want to lie still and 
trick it into picking you up and wearing you. Only then will it realize 
its mistake but by that time, it is too late! Of course, the ring 
bearer might recognize you for what you are when it gets close, at 
which point it will attack you, so this approach is not without risk. 
But if you succeed in being worn, the ring bearer becomes your pet, and 
is controlled by your will. Now, at last, you may move about!

The other order of business for the ring upon starting the game is to 
acquire magical spells by absorbing suitable jewelry (rings or 
amulets). Since these are rare in the early going, the ring is actually 
born with a couple of fine trinkets. You should absorb these initially 
to gain a couple of minor powers that will assist you in the early 
going (Again, this power is available with the 'U' command).

</font><font color="#c00000">Acquiring and Keeping Your Bearer

</font><font color="#ffffff">Using Glitter to attract a ring bearer was just described above. It is 
the most reliable means of acquiring a ring bearer, but it only works 
if you look like a ring! This means you must leave your current bearer, 
if any, and probably dismiss it as well (since it will attack any new 
potential bearer that approaches). This puts you back to square one, 
unable to move. Also, while this approach is the most reliable it only 
offers a single chance of success. If discovered then the potential 
bearer will attack you and won't be fooled again! At this point, the 
ring does have a second means at its disposal: Charm.

Charming a potential ring bearer is less likely to succeed, but can be 
tried multiple times until it works (if ever!). If successful, the 
potential ring bearer becomes your pet and can forced to wear you (Use 
the 'p' pet command 'ride a pet'. You probably also want to turn on the 
'p' pet command 'stay close' so that the charmed ring bearer will come 
next to you. By the way, to leave your current ring bearer you may use 
the 'p' pet command 'get off a pet'.)

Both approaches to acquiring a ring bearer rely on the ring's charisma 
for success. Next to intelligence (which is useful for invoking 
absorbed powers) charisma is the ring's most important stat, so be sure 
to roll a good value for both Int and Chr on birth.

A final point to mention is that your hold on a ring bearer is not 
omnipotent and may fail occasionally. If it does, then the bearer will 
cast you off, hurling you on the ground, and begin attacking you! 
Again, the ring needs a strong force of personality (i.e., Charisma) to 
maintain its dominance. And should this occur, the ring can try to 
recharm the bearer, but sometimes a soured ring bearer simply needs to 
be put down at which point the ring may glitter patiently to lure a new 
bearer.

</font><font color="#c00000">Getting Powers and Growing Stronger

</font><font color="#ffffff">Rings cannot wear any equipment. Instead, they gain abilities and 
spells by absorbing any jewelry (rings or amulets) that they find. The 
current status of magical essences, their effects, and their powers are 
all displayed in the character dump as well as by using the Extra 
Character Info command (~x). Here you will see how many essences of 
each type you have so far absorbed as well as the current bonus (if 
any) you are gaining and, finally, how many more essences you need to 
find to gain the next bonus for this type. Scrolling down, you can see 
the spells you have gained so far.

Absorbing jewelry is available with a power from the 'U' command, but, 
for ergonomic reasons, also happens automatically if you destroy a 
suitable object (either directly or with the autodestroyer).

Getting powerful spells is difficult, and the ultimate powers may prove 
elusive. However, with a suitably powerful ring bearer, ultimate 
success should be possible.
