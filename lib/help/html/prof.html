<font color="#00ffff">The Proficiency System

</font><font color="#ffffff">FrogComposband has a number of independent proficiency systems - </font><font color="#ff0000">weapon 
proficiency</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">spell proficiency</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">riding proficiency</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">martial arts 
proficiency </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#ff0000">dual-wielding proficiency</font><font color="#ffffff">. All of these are closely 
related and have many similarities; in particular, your proficiency is 
indicated by the rough labels </font><font color="#00ff00">[Un]skilled</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#00ff00">[Be]ginner</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#00ff00">[Sk]illed</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
</font><font color="#00ff00">[Ex]pert </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#00ff00">[Ma]ster</font><font color="#ffffff">, and you have </font><font color="#ff0000">proficiency caps </font><font color="#ffffff">which are usually 
class-dependent and denote the highest proficiency you can actually 
attain. There are also some key differences between the systems, 
though; the practical meanings of the five labels vary from skill to 
skill, as do the ways in which proficiency can be gained.

<a name="Weapon"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Weapon Proficiency

</font><font color="#ffffff">You have an independent proficiency for each kind of melee and missile 
weapon in the game - one proficiency for daggers, another for small 
swords, a third for maces, a fourth for light crossbows, and so on. You 
also have independent proficiency caps for each kind of weapon, though 
there tends to be a fair bit of correlation: if your cap is high for a 
particular weapon, it is probably also high for similar weapons.

You can view both your current proficiencies, and the proficiency caps, 
through the </font><font color="#ff8000">~ </font><font color="#ffffff">Knowledge Menu's </font><font color="#ff8000">P</font><font color="#ffffff">roficiency section. You can press </font><font color="#ff8000">M </font><font color="#ffffff">to 
toggle between four different display modes: current proficiency 
(displayed first), proficiency caps, current proficiency as a 
percentage of caps, and current proficiency as a percentage of full 
mastery. The percentage displays allow you to track your progress in 
finer detail than the five rough labels alone.

</font><font color="#00ff00">The most important difference between weapon proficiency and other 
proficiencies is that [Be]ginner is acceptably good as a proficiency 
cap for a weapon. </font><font color="#ffffff">This is not the case for most other proficiencies; 
for riding and dual-wielding you really want a Master cap or at the 
very least Expert. But the weapon caps are not nearly as important, and 
only an [Un]skilled cap should really worry you.

Weapon proficiency is gained by hitting or attempting to hit a monster 
with a weapon. High proficiency can only be attained by fighting 
high-level monsters. New players are occasionally mystified by why 
their proficiency does not seem to improve in the early game; this 
happens if you start the game already having Beginner proficiency or 
better, as the first monsters you meet will then be too low-level to 
allow proficiency improvement.

The effect of weapon proficiency is a moderate bonus or penalty to your 
accuracy, ranging from -20 to-hit at 0% proficiency to +20 to-hit at 
full mastery.

<a name="Dual-Wielding"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Dual-Wielding Proficiency

</font><font color="#ffffff">Dual-wielding proficiency, and its proficiency cap, are extremely 
important for any character who wishes to dual-wield (unless they do so 
with no intention to melee). Like weapon proficiency, dual-wielding 
proficiency can be checked through the </font><font color="#ff8000">~P </font><font color="#ffffff">menu.

Dual-wielding proficiency is gained by fighting monsters in melee while 
dual-wielding. As with weapons, high dual-wielding proficiency can only 
be attained by fighting high-level monsters. Low proficiency gives a 
sizeable penalty to your accuracy, plus (unless you have gloves of 
Genji) a moderate penalty to your damage. For nearly all characters, 
dual-wielding proficiency starts at an extremely penalizing level; it 
takes quite a while of missing on all your hits to reach a point where 
your damage output from two weapons is even close to what it would be 
from a single weapon. Because of this, </font><font color="#00ff00">it is a good idea to check your 
cap before you start dual-wielding </font><font color="#ffffff">on a melee character; if your cap is 
low, all that effort will have been in vain, as you will always be 
better off with a single weapon.

Even at very high mastery, dual-wielding is only rarely your best 
option in terms of pure damage. The main allure of dual-wielding is in 
the opportunity to gain the bonuses and resistances of two weapons.

<a name="MartialArts"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Martial Arts Proficiency

</font><font color="#ffffff">Martial arts proficiency is essentially just weapon proficiency in the 
special case of unarmed combat; and like weapon proficiency, it can be 
viewed through the </font><font color="#ff8000">~P </font><font color="#ffffff">proficiency menu. The only difference is that 
proficiency gain is somewhat different for martial arts: weapon 
proficiency gain requires the monster fought to be sufficiently 
high-level compared to existing proficiency, while for martial arts the 
monster must be sufficiently high-level compared to the player's 
character level. The speed at which proficiency is gained is also 
slightly different for martial arts.

<a name="Riding"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Riding Proficiency

</font><font color="#ffffff">Riding proficiency is the key to everything about riding a monster; it 
determines which monsters you can ride, how much of your mount's speed 
you gain, how likely your mount is to throw you off, how rapidly your 
mount recovers from various status effects, how negatively riding 
impacts your spellcasting, how much you are penalized for fighting with 
unsuitable weapons. </font><font color="#00ff00">Consequently, your proficiency cap is very 
important if you plan to ride; </font><font color="#ffffff">for characters with low caps, riding is 
only viable in the early game, if at all.

Riding proficiency can be improved in several ways: through meleeing 
sufficiently high-level monsters while riding, through shooting 
high-level monsters while riding (conditions easy to meet, but 
improvement very slow), and by experiencing situations where you can be 
thrown off a challenging mount.

Riding proficiency follows a slightly different labeling system 
compared to the other proficiencies; [Be]ginner, [Sk]illed and [Ex]pert 
correspond to lower percentages of full mastery in it. As with the 
other non-spell proficiencies, riding proficiency and its cap can be 
viewed in the </font><font color="#ff8000">~P </font><font color="#ffffff">proficiency display.

<a name="Spells"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Spell Proficiency

</font><font color="#ffffff">Spell proficiency affects spell fail rates and mana cost. The main 
difference between spell proficiency and the other systems is that most 
characters can (if they wish) gain proficiency extremely rapidly by 
studying the same spell repeatedly. Spell proficiency caps are also 
mostly independent of your class, although your class does affect fail 
rates and mana cost in other ways. See <a href="magic.html#Proficiency"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for a more detailed 
explanation of the spell proficiency system.
