<font color="#00ffff">Options and Effects

</font><font color="#ffffff">Most of the </font><font color="#ff0000">options </font><font color="#ffffff">are accessible through the </font><font color="#ff8000">= </font><font color="#ffffff">command, which 
provides an interface to the various sets of options available to the 
player.

In the descriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary 
which is shown on the options screen, plus the internal name of the 
option in parenthesis, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref 
files to force the option to a given setting (see <a href="pref.html#Options"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more info).

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including 
</font><font color="#ff0000">disturb </font><font color="#ffffff">(cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are 
in progress), </font><font color="#ff0000">flush </font><font color="#ffffff">(forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress 
queue, including any macros in progress), and </font><font color="#ff0000">fresh </font><font color="#ffffff">(dump any pending 
output to the screen).

<a name="Birth"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Birth options

</font><font color="#ffffff">The birth options can only be accessed while creating a new character 
(press </font><font color="#ff8000">= </font><font color="#ffffff">while creating the character). There is no way to turn them 
off after the creation is finished!
  
  
<a name="coffee_break"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Coffee-break mode (accelerated game) </font><font color="#404040">(coffee_break)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Coffee-break mode is a shorter and more compact version of the game. 
  The player gains experience much faster and finds more and better 
  objects in the dungeon, as well as more money; most forms of 
  proficiency gain are also accelerated. </font><font color="#c08040">Coffee-break mode </font><font color="#ffffff">uses a 
  single town with no wilderness; forced descent is turned on (but 
  recalling back to the town is allowed), and all stairs in the dungeon 
  are two-level shafts. Small levels generate more often in the early 
  part of the game but become rarer (and less small) towards the 
  endgame. Unlike ironman-downward mode (see <a href="option.html#ironman_downward"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">), the player is 
  allowed to skip dungeon quests by recalling, although doing so incurs 
  a large fame penalty.
  
<a name="easy_id"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Easy Identify </font><font color="#404040">(easy_id)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, all objects are automatically fully 
  identified on walkover, and items, spells and town services of 
  Identify/*Identify* become unnecessary.
  
<a name="easy_lore"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Easy Lore </font><font color="#404040">(easy_lore)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the player will be born with complete 
  knowledge of monster lore, including the various attacks and nasty 
  surprises that many monsters usually offer to the uninitiated. This 
  is a bit of a spoiler option, but is available for those who don't 
  enjoy learning each of the many monsters present in the game. </font><font color="#c08040">Easy 
  Lore </font><font color="#ffffff">also renders a few aspects of the game non-functional or 
  pointless, including the ability to </font><font color="#ff0000">Probe </font><font color="#ffffff">monsters to learn about 
  them as you encounter them, and the town </font><font color="#ff0000">Beastmaster Lore </font><font color="#ffffff">service to 
  learn about monsters before you see them (for a price, of course).
  
<a name="easy_damage"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Easy monster health and damage information </font><font color="#404040">(easy_damage)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Also known as "Fnord-mode", this option allows the player to see the 
  exact damage delivered by each attack, and to receive additional 
  information about monster health and debuffs through a percentage 
  display. Player health bars are also converted to use percentages. 
  This is a very powerful easy-mode, and using it gives a score 
  penalty.
  
<a name="allow_spoilers"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Allow spoilers </font><font color="#404040">(allow_spoilers)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Enabling this option allows the player to view some spoiler files 
  in-game using the ^Z command. (This option should never be used on 
  the angband.live online server for technical reasons.)
  
<a name="power_tele"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use enhanced telepathy </font><font color="#404040">(power_tele)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the player can see the race of a 
  telepathically detected monster (i.e. telepathically seen monsters 
  are treated identically to monsters seen through any other means). 
  With this option off ("fuzzy telepathy"), only the monster's 
  "species" (default display character) is shown, but its color and 
  race are hidden.
  
<a name="easy_thalos"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Allow easy teleportation to Thalos </font><font color="#404040">(easy_thalos)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is on, inns will start offering teleportation to the 
  town of </font><font color="#ff0000">Thalos </font><font color="#ffffff">as soon as at least one out of Anambar, Angwil, 
  Morivant or Telmora has been visited by the player. Since Thalos is 
  located on an island, travelling there by foot is very dangerous for 
  a low-level character, especially at night. This option makes it 
  possible to reach Thalos safely earlier in the game.
  
<a name="never_forget"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Easy Labyrinth and no amnesia </font><font color="#404040">(never_forget)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option removes amnesia attacks from the game, and allows the 
  player to map the normally unmappable </font><font color="#ff0000">Labyrinth </font><font color="#ffffff">dungeon in the same 
  way as all other dungeons. (Turning this option on does not 
  necessarily make the game easier, since monsters who might normally 
  use the annoying but ultimately harmless Amnesia spell will instead 
  select one of their other, more dangerous spell options.)
  
<a name="empty_lore"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Always forget item lore between games </font><font color="#404040">(empty_lore)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option off, a new game started by opening a dead 
  character's savefile inherits the dead character's ability to 
  recognize attributes on excellent items and artifacts. Turning this 
  option on empties this item lore. This option has no effect if the 
  game is not started by opening a dead character's savefile, since the 
  character then starts with no item lore anyway.
  
<a name="smart_learn"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Monsters learn from their mistakes </font><font color="#404040">(smart_learn)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to, and 
  to use this information to choose the best attacks.
  
<a name="smart_cheat"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Monsters exploit player's weaknesses </font><font color="#404040">(smart_cheat)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, and 
  to use this information to choose the best attacks. Combine this with 
  Easy Lore to regain lost honour.
  
<a name="no_wilderness"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Play without a wilderness </font><font color="#404040">(no_wilderness)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option disables the wilderness, forcing you to play with a 
  single special town level. As a result, the only dungeon that will be 
  available is the </font><font color="#ff0000">Pits of Angband</font><font color="#ffffff">. However, the town is relatively 
  well serviced and many of the various fixed quests will be available 
  for your pleasure (see <a href="town.html#NoWilderness"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).
  
<a name="ironman_shops"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Stores are permanently closed </font><font color="#404040">(ironman_shops)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option closes all shops. Try to survive in the deeps of the 
  dungeon without supplies from town. Your Home still functions 
  normally, and various town services are still available.
  
<a name="ironman_downward"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disable recall and use of up stairs </font><font color="#404040">(ironman_downward)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You are not allowed to climb upwards, or recall to town. All stairs 
  are downstairs and every time you teleport level, you'll teleport to 
  a deeper level.
  
<a name="ironman_empty_levels"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Always create empty 'arena' levels </font><font color="#404040">(ironman_empty_levels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, then every level will be empty 'arena' 
  level. See the "Allow empty 'arena' levels" option below.
  
<a name="ironman_nightmare"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Nightmare mode(it isn't even remotely fair!) </font><font color="#404040">(ironman_nightmare)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, all monsters become unusually powerful, 
  and fast. And there will be various unbelievable things happening in 
  various situations. Furthermore, at 12:00 every night, you will have 
  a real nightmare. You need to be crazy to turn this option on!
  
<a name="thrall_mode"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Thrall mode (start in extreme danger) </font><font color="#404040">(thrall_mode)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, you start the game on level 90 of R'lyeh 
  (or level 90 of Angband in no-wilderness mode) as a runaway slave of 
  the dungeon's demonic masters. With extreme care, you have managed to 
  steal a few useful items that might help you in your escape. But now 
  you've been noticed, everyone's on alert, and it is up to you to die, 
  escape - or fight your way through...
  
<a name="wacky_rooms"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Always generate very unusual rooms </font><font color="#404040">(wacky_rooms)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, every room becomes a vault (except in a 
  few dungeons with special generation rules), vaults are allowed to 
  generate extremely out-of-depth monsters and floor items, and 
  extremely small levels are made slightly larger (to accommodate the 
  vaults). This option is purposely game-unbalancing, and is intended 
  for experienced players who have found they actually like the game 
  unbalanced now and then.
  
<a name="enable_virtues"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Enable virtues </font><font color="#404040">(enable_virtues)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Turns on the virtue system. Virtues can help or hinder the player; 
  among other things, they affect spell fail rates, the strength of 
  many magical effects, and the friendliness of some monsters.
  
<a name="preserve_mode"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Preserve artifacts </font><font color="#404040">(preserve_mode)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">In non-preserve mode, once a fixed artifact is generated (either on 
  the dungeon floor or in a monster drop), it will never be generated 
  again during that game. This means that if you miss the artifact by 
  leaving the level before you pick it up it is gone forever. On the 
  other hand, in preserve mode this behavior is only exhibited once you 
  have identified the artifact; it is therefore safer to leave a level 
  before it is completely explored, as any undiscovered fixed artifact 
  can be regenerated on a subsequent level.
  
<a name="quest_unique"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Random quests for unique monsters only </font><font color="#404040">(quest_unique)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option turned on, the ten </font><font color="#ff0000">random quests </font><font color="#ffffff">in the Pits of 
  Angband will all require you to kill a unique monster. With the 
  option off, some of them (especially the early ones) may feature 
  groups of non-unique monsters instead, similarly to the fixed Warg 
  Quest.
  
<a name="no_selling"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disable selling but increase gold drops </font><font color="#404040">(no_selling)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option on, the player cannot sell items for money (only 
  give them for free), and turning items into gold through Alchemy is 
  less effective; but gold drops in quests and dungeons are increased 
  to compensate. (Gold drops in the wilderness are not affected.)
  
<a name="reduce_uniques"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Reduce the number of uniques (randomly) </font><font color="#404040">(reduce_uniques)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option removes some percentage of uniques from the game. A few 
  uniques (mostly those who appear in either quests or the Thalos 
  arena) are fixed and will never be removed.
  
<a name="single_pantheon"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Play with only one pantheon </font><font color="#404040">(single_pantheon)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option removes one of the game's two main monster pantheons 
  (Olympian or Egyptian) from the game, but also re-adds all members of 
  the remaining pantheon if they have been removed by the 
  reduce_uniques option. In wilderness mode, the dungeon associated 
  with the removed pantheon is also removed from the game. Which 
  pantheon remains can be either specified by the player or left to a 
  random decision.
  
<a name="always_small_levels"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Level size </font><font color="#404040">(always_small_levels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option allows you to select from a variety of different 
  level-size selection methods. See <a href="small_lv.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more details.
  
<a name="increase_density"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Increase monster density on small levels </font><font color="#404040">(increase_density)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option switches to the old PosChengband 6.1.0 monster density 
  formula for small levels, increasing the number of monsters generated 
  on newly entered small levels.
  
<a name="no_big_dungeons"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Allow small levels in all dungeons except Arena </font><font color="#404040">(no_big_dungeons)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, small levels can generate even in dungeons 
  that normally always generate maximum-sized levels. The exception is 
  Arena, which will still always generate large levels.
  
<a name="even_proportions"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Sometimes reshape very flat "pipe" levels </font><font color="#404040">(even_proportions)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is turned on, levels with a very high (6-to-1 or 
  higher) width-to-height ratio are sometimes re-shaped to have the 
  same total area but different proportions.
  
<a name="no_chris"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Nexus attacks never teleport to another dungeon </font><font color="#404040">(no_chris)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Turning on this option disables the "Chris effect" (a nexus attack 
  effect that teleports the player to another dungeon, potentially one 
  that's highly dangerous and was never previously visited by the 
  player). As a substitute for the Chris effect, the player's stats 
  will be scrambled; or if stat scrambling is also disabled, the Baby 
  Foul Curse (a less deadly version of the infamous Ancient Foul Curse) 
  will trigger. This option has no effect (or, rather, is effectively 
  always on) in no-wilderness mode, since no-wilderness mode only has 
  the one dungeon.
  
<a name="no_scrambling"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disallow stat scrambling from monster attacks </font><font color="#404040">(no_scrambling)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Selecting this option disables </font><font color="#ff0000">stat scrambling</font><font color="#ffffff">, an effect that 
  permanently switches two of the player's six stats (as well as their 
  respective stat caps). Stat scrambling can potentially set the player 
  back a long way if a high key stat is swapped with a low, less 
  important stat. Attacks (and other effects) that would normally 
  trigger a scramble will instead trigger the Baby Foul Curse, which is 
  more dangerous in the short-term but doesn't have the same long-term 
  effects.
  
<a name="comp_mode"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disallow permanent changes to player race </font><font color="#404040">(comp_mode)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Disables all effects (except for monster evolution) that might 
  permanently change the player's race during the game. This option is 
  intended for use in competitions, and to ensure challenging builds 
  remain challenging. (It can also be used to ensure an easy build 
  remains easy, but who'd do that?!)
  
  
<a name="Input"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Input Options
  
<a name="rogue_like_commands"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Rogue-like commands </font><font color="#404040">(rogue_like_commands)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Selects the </font><font color="#ff0000">roguelike </font><font color="#ffffff">command set which is an alternative way of 
  mapping keystrokes to underlying game commands. (see <a href="command.html#RogueKeyset"></font><font color="#00ff00">[e]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for info).
  
<a name="always_pickup"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Pick things up by default </font><font color="#404040">(always_pickup)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it 
  up. Otherwise, you must use the </font><font color="#ff8000">g </font><font color="#ffffff">command, or the </font><font color="#ff8000">- </font><font color="#ffffff">command while 
  walking. Combined with </font><font color="#ff0000">carry_query_flag</font><font color="#ffffff">, allows you to selectively 
  pick up all items which you step on. This option disables the 
  autodestroyer functions of the Mogaminator, so it's often used 
  together with </font><font color="#ff0000">destroy_items </font><font color="#ffffff">for the easy auto-destroyer.
  
<a name="quick_messages"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Activate quick messages </font><font color="#404040">(quick_messages)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the </font><font color="#00ffff">-more- </font><font color="#ffffff">prompt 
  (useful for monster farming). Allows most keys to mean "no" to any 
  "(y/n)" prompt.
  
<a name="command_menu"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Enable command selection menu </font><font color="#404040">(command_menu)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The command selection menu is a helpful tool for beginning players. 
  By pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">ENTER</font><font color="#ffffff">, this option displays a menu of all available 
  commands, which the user may drill into with the arrow keys. This 
  makes it easier to discover the keypress required to do a specific 
  action:
  
    +----------------------------------------------------+
    |   Magic/Special         &gt; Action                   |

            |   Command pets(p)         Search mode ON/OFF(S/#)  |
            +----------------------------------------------------+
  
  
<a name="use_old_target"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use old target by default </font><font color="#404040">(use_old_target)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces all commands which normally ask for a </font><font color="#ff0000">direction </font><font color="#ffffff">to 
  use the current </font><font color="#ff0000">target </font><font color="#ffffff">if there is one. Use of this option can be 
  dangerous if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear 
  them when done. Actually, position targets now automatically clear 
  when they are no longer valid (e.g. after a teleport). Pay attention 
  to the character info section of your screen as it always shows your 
  current target, whether monster or location.
  
<a name="auto_target"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Automatically target nearest monster </font><font color="#404040">(auto_target)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, every offensive spell you cast or device 
  you use will automatically target the closest monster if there is not 
  already a valid target selected. If you use this option, then it is 
  highly recommended that you also enable the </font><font color="#ff0000">use_old_target </font><font color="#ffffff">option. 
  That way, if you are in a situation where the automatic targeting is 
  not what you want, you can just select a target up front before 
  casting your spell.
  
<a name="always_repeat"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Repeat obvious commands </font><font color="#404040">(always_repeat)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Tells the game that when you attempt to </font><font color="#ff0000">open </font><font color="#ffffff">a door or chest, </font><font color="#ff0000">bash </font><font color="#ffffff">a 
  door, </font><font color="#ff0000">tunnel </font><font color="#ffffff">through walls, or </font><font color="#ff0000">disarm </font><font color="#ffffff">traps or chests, that you wish 
  to repeat the command 99 times (see <a href="command.html#CommandCounts"></font><font color="#00ff00">[f]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).
  
<a name="confirm_destroy"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Prompt for destruction of known worthless items </font><font color="#404040">(confirm_destroy)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Normally, no confirmation will be asked if you attempt to destroy an 
  object which you know to be worthless. If this option is set, the 
  Destroy command always asks for confirmation.
  
<a name="confirm_wear"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Confirm to wear/wield known cursed items </font><font color="#404040">(confirm_wear)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find 
  themselves wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this option 
  is set, you should be safe from such typing mistakes: you will be 
  prompted if you attempt to wear or wield an item if your character 
  knows it is cursed.
  
<a name="target_pet"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Allow targetting pets </font><font color="#404040">(target_pet)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Normally, the program doesn't automatically choose pets as target in 
  the targeting mode of attack spells. If this option is set, the 
  program always chooses every monster in sight as target.
  
<a name="easy_open"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Automatically open doors </font><font color="#404040">(easy_open)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Makes it easy for your character to open a door: simply by walking 
  into it! Also the open command will automatically select one 
  direction if only one door is near you.
  
<a name="easy_disarm"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Automatically disarm traps </font><font color="#404040">(easy_disarm)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Makes it easy for your character disarms a trap: simply by walking 
  into it! Also the disarm command will automatically select one 
  direction if only one known trap is near you.
  
<a name="auto_get_ammo"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Automatically get nearby ammo </font><font color="#404040">(auto_get_ammo)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option instructs the Auto-Get Objects command (</font><font color="#ff8000">^G</font><font color="#ffffff">) to 
  automatically travel to nearby, visible ammo which is inscribed with 
  </font><font color="#ff8000">=g </font><font color="#ffffff">(i.e., ammo which you have instructed the autopicker to 
  automatically pickup). This enhancement is useful for archer builds 
  after all nearby monsters have been slain. You might consider using 
  the stronger </font><font color="#ff0000">auto_get_objects </font><font color="#ffffff">option instead.
  
<a name="auto_get_objects"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Automatically get nearby objects </font><font color="#404040">(auto_get_objects)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option instructs the Auto-Get Objects command (</font><font color="#ff8000">^G</font><font color="#ffffff">) to 
  automatically travel to nearby visible objects which you have 
  registered to either pickup or destroy. This option subsumes (and 
  extends) the </font><font color="#ff0000">auto_get_ammo </font><font color="#ffffff">option since ammo inscribed with </font><font color="#ff8000">=g </font><font color="#ffffff">is 
  certainly registered for auto-pickup.
  
<a name="auto_detect_traps"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Automatically detect traps while running </font><font color="#404040">(auto_detect_traps)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the game will attempt to automatically 
  detect traps whenever you run outside a trap-detected region. Use the 
  </font><font color="#ff0000">view_unsafe_grids </font><font color="#ffffff">to make trap detected regions more visually 
  obvious. For this option to work, you must be carrying a scroll, 
  staff or rod able to detect traps. The game will use the object for 
  you automatically, consuming a scroll or a single charge from an 
  appropriate device.
  
<a name="auto_map_area"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Automatically map area while running </font><font color="#404040">(auto_map_area)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the game will attempt to automatically map 
  your surroundings whenever you run outside a previously mapped zone. 
  Unlike </font><font color="#ff0000">auto_detect_traps</font><font color="#ffffff">, there is no visual indication of regions 
  that are flagged as mapped versus those that are not. When you invoke 
  magic mapping, the game maps your surroundings, and it also sets a 
  flag on each tile in the area of effect. When your player runs from a 
  tile so flagged onto one not so flagged, then the game attempts to 
  automatically map for you by locating an appropriate scroll or device 
  and using it for you. Both this option and </font><font color="#ff0000">auto_detect_traps </font><font color="#ffffff">work 
  best if you always run when travelling about. When you enter a new 
  level, manually detect traps and map your surroundings. If you always 
  run when travelling, the game will automatically take care of the 
  detection tedium for the rest of the level.
  
<a name="numpad_as_cursorkey"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use numpad keys as cursor keys in editor mode </font><font color="#404040">(numpad_as_cursorkey)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option makes numpad keys work as cursor movement keys while text 
  editing mode. Which include auto-picker editor, inputing an 
  inscription, a macro action, and etc.
  
<a name="use_pack_slots"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use and Display Inventory Slots </font><font color="#404040">(use_pack_slots)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option, the object prompt will use and display the current 
  inventory slot for objects in question. For example, if your food 
  happens to currently be in slot h), the the </font><font color="#ff8000">E</font><font color="#ffffff">at command will require 
  you to press </font><font color="#ff8000">h </font><font color="#ffffff">to use this item. Without this option, each object 
  prompt will begin labels at a). Some players prefer to keep the 
  inventory slot, even though it constantly shifts as you add and 
  remove new objects to your pack. Other players prefer to have 
  commands use the same labels for the same objects upon successive 
  calls (For example, pick up a spellbook and your food is now in the 
  i) slot. This may puzzle you, since the last time you were hungry you 
  pressed </font><font color="#ff8000">Eh</font><font color="#ffffff">, but now you need to press </font><font color="#ff8000">Ei</font><font color="#ffffff">. With this option turned 
  off, eating rations of food will always be </font><font color="#ff8000">Ea </font><font color="#ffffff">... at least until you 
  pick up some mushrooms! However, if you do, then your eye will 
  quickly perceive the presence of two items in the object prompt next 
  time you </font><font color="#ff8000">E</font><font color="#ffffff">at).
  
<a name="MapScreen"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Map &amp; Screen Options
  
<a name="center_player"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Center map while walking </font><font color="#404040">(center_player)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the map window automatically recenters on 
  the player as you walk. I find this rather disturbing, but it helps 
  if you are on a small monitor and worried about off screen monsters.
  
<a name="center_running"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Centering even while running </font><font color="#404040">(center_running)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Normally, the map does not center on the player if the player moves 
  with the "run" command, only when the running finishes. If this 
  option is set, the map always centers on the player.
  
<a name="view_yellow_lite"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use special colors for torch-lit grids </font><font color="#404040">(view_yellow_lite)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids in 
  certain situations (see the entries for"view_granite_lite" and 
  "view_special_lite"). Turning this option off will slightly improve 
  game speed.
  
<a name="view_bright_lite"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use special colors for 'viewable' grids </font><font color="#404040">(view_bright_lite)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable" grids 
  in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and 
  "view_special_lite"). When this option is set, floor grids which are 
  normally drawn in "white" but which are not currently "viewable" by 
  the player are instead drawn in "dark gray". This makes the 
  "viewable" grids to appear "brighter" than the others, allowing the 
  player to easily determine which floor grids are in "line of sight". 
  Turning this option off will probably increase the speed of the game.
  
<a name="view_granite_lite"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use special colors for wall grids </font><font color="#404040">(view_granite_lite)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids 
  which are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally 
  are). When the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid 
  is torch-lit, we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the 
  "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the "view_bright_lite" option is 
  set, and the grid is not in line of sight, or the grid is dark, or 
  the grid is only "partially" lit, then we use "gray", otherwise we 
  use the normal "white". Turning this option off will probably 
  increase the speed of the game. This option may not work well if the 
  attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed.
  
<a name="view_special_lite"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use special colors for floor grids </font><font color="#404040">(view_special_lite)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids

<a name="view_perma_grids"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Map remembers all perma-lit grids </font><font color="#404040">(view_perma_grids)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player. This 
  option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids were 
  perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids, 
  unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids. Turning off this option 
  allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line of 
  sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite" 
  option. Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player are 
  always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is 
  memorized independently from the memorization of the grid itself.
  
<a name="view_torch_grids"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Map remembers all torch-lit grids </font><font color="#404040">(view_torch_grids)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player. 
  This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids 
  have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use 
  of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display of 
  floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray","lit" 
  grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite" option is 
  set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in 
  "orange". Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit" are 
  considered to be "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless the 
  "view_yellow_lite" option is set, in which case they are drawn in 
  "yellow".
  
<a name="view_unsafe_grids"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Map marked by detect traps </font><font color="#404040">(view_unsafe_grids)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a 
  detect trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This 
  allows you to determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect 
  traps, but does not ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x' are 
  trap free. This option has no effect on surface grids, but outdoor 
  locations cannot be trapped.
  
<a name="fresh_before"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Flush output while continuous command </font><font color="#404040">(fresh_before)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all output before every command. 
  This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game 
  somewhat. Note that this option is only useful when using macros, 
  resting, running, or repeating commands, since the output is always 
  flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the user.
  
<a name="fresh_after"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Flush output after monster's move </font><font color="#404040">(fresh_after)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all output after not only every 
  player command, but also after every round of processing monsters and 
  objects, which will give you maximal information, but may slow down 
  the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on faster machines 
  you normally do not have a chance to see the results anyway.
  
<a name="fresh_message"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Flush output after every message </font><font color="#404040">(fresh_message)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all output after every message 
  displayed by the game. This will give you maximal information, but 
  may slow down the game somewhat.
  
<a name="hilite_player"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Hilite the player with the cursor </font><font color="#404040">(hilite_player)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Place the visible cursor on the player. This looks fine on some Unix 
  machines, but horrible on most graphics machines. Note that only some 
  machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, 
  hiding the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.
  
<a name="display_path"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Display actual path before shooting </font><font color="#404040">(display_path)

  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option disables "full" names for identified 'flavored' objects, 
  in other words, if this option is not in use, an identified Potion of 
  Speed could be listed (for example) as a Blue Potion of Speed. If you 
  prefer simpler, less verbose descriptions, set this option.
  
<a name="always_show_list"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Always show list when choosing items </font><font color="#404040">(always_show_list)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">When this option is set, all commands which lets you to choose an 
  item from inventory or equipment list will automatically show list 
  when activated.
  
<a name="depth_in_feet"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show dungeon level in feet </font><font color="#404040">(depth_in_feet)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as an actual level. 
  This also affects the monster memory display.
  
<a name="effective_speed"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show speeds as energy multipliers </font><font color="#404040">(effective_speed)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display player and monster speeds as energy multipliers. This style 
  is somewhat ugly, but helps players understand what a given speed 
  actually means in terms of energy.
  
<a name="show_labels"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show labels in object listings </font><font color="#404040">(show_labels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the labels for objects in the equipment list, and in any 
  special window which is displaying the equipment. These labels 
  indicate what the player is using the object for, such as "wielding" 
  or "wearing" (in a given location). After you have played for a 
  while, this information is no longer useful, and can be annoying.
  
<a name="show_weights"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show weights in object listings </font><font color="#404040">(show_weights)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the weights of objects in the inventory and equipment lists, 
  and in stores, and in any special window which is displaying any of 
  these lists.
  
<a name="show_discounts"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show discounts in object listings </font><font color="#404040">(show_discounts)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the discount of the object, if any, as part of its 
  inscription. Disabling this option won't remove the object's 
  discount. Rather, this information will no longer be displayed to the 
  player.
  
<a name="show_power"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show device power in object listings (if known) </font><font color="#404040">(show_power)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Displays details about an object's power (like </font><font color="#008040">dam 158 </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#c08040">heal 250</font><font color="#ffffff">) 
  in inventories, allowing you to compare items at a glance.
  
<a name="show_item_graph"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show items graphics </font><font color="#404040">(show_item_graph)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Displays small icons of the items in your inventory list, equipment 
  list and stores.
  
<a name="equippy_chars"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Display 'equippy' chars </font><font color="#404040">(equippy_chars)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option will show you a graphical representation of your worn 
  equipment on the main screen. The 'equippy' chars will use the 
  standard symbols of the respective items.
  
<a name="display_hp_bar"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Display player hp bar </font><font color="#404040">(display_hp_bar)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details

    @[</font><font color="#ffff00">*******</font><font color="#ffffff">--]
  
<a name="display_sp_bar"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Display player sp bar </font><font color="#404040">(display_sp_bar)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current mana. For example:
    </font><font color="#c0c0c0">?</font><font color="#ffffff">[</font><font color="#c00000">***</font><font color="#ffffff">------]
  
<a name="display_food_bar"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Display detailed food status </font><font color="#404040">(display_food_bar)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details

<a name="compress_savefile"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Compress messages in savefiles </font><font color="#404040">(compress_savefile)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages" that

  drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.
  
<a name="abbrev_extra"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Describe obj's extra resistances by abbreviation </font><font color="#404040">(abbrev_extra)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string 
  for the object's extra resitances and extra abilities are added as 
  fake inscriptions of the object.
  
  A word "EXTRA" means that the ability must not be obvious from the 
  objects name. For example, a pair of boots of Levitation sometimes 
  has EXTRA shard resistance. But fire resistance of an armor of Resist 
  Fire is not an EXTRA resistance.
  
  The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are 
  described in <a href="objects.html#InscriptionAbbrev"></font><font color="#00ff00">[g]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
<a name="abbrev_all"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Describe obj's all resistances by abbreviation </font><font color="#404040">(abbrev_all)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string

<a name="exp_need"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show the experience needed for the next level </font><font color="#404040">(exp_need)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Setting this option to yes alters the display of experience on the 
  left of the main screen to the experience needed to reach the next 
  character level, instead of the character's current total experience.
  
<a name="ignore_unview"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Ignore actions of out of sight monsters </font><font color="#404040">(ignore_unview)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option, you won't receive messages when out of sight 
  monsters fight one another. This is useful if you are playing with 
  lots of pets and don't wish to read a blow by blow account of the 
  battle raging around you.
  
<a name="display_race"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Player character depends on their race </font><font color="#404040">(display_race)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option a player who plays as a Quylthulg, for example, will 
  be represented by a Q. If the option is turned off the player will 
  always be @. 
  
<a name="show_origins"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show object origins on examination </font><font color="#404040">(show_origins)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option selected, the origins of an object (where you found 
  it, and who or what you got it from) are displayed when the object is 
  examined.
  
<a name="show_discovery"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show time of discovery on examination </font><font color="#404040">(show_discovery)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the date of object discovery and the 
  player's character level at time of discovery are added to the 
  object's origins. (Also, with this option off, if a pile of objects 
  with different origins is formed, all information about the origins 
  is lost. With this option on, the details of the first object to be 
  discovered are applied to the whole pile instead.)
  
<a name="final_dump_origins"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show origins in final character dumps </font><font color="#404040">(final_dump_origins)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is on, the origins of the player's equipment are 
  included in character dumps if the character is either dead or a 
  winner, but omitted otherwise. (Whether discovery details are 
  included with the origins depends on whether show_discovery is on or 
  not.)
  
<a name="always_dump_origins"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show origins in all character dumps </font><font color="#404040">(always_dump_origins)

<a name="easy_mimics"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use 'x' for monsters that look like things </font><font color="#404040">(easy_mimics)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, monsters that are easily mistaken for 
  non-monsters (like mimics, cloakers, death swords and wall monsters) 
  will be displayed with the 'x' glyph instead of their native glyph. 
  (A few thing-like monsters do still retain their original glyphs; 
  these include death scythes, mushrooms and creeping coins.)
  
<a name="list_stairs"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Display stairs in the object list </font><font color="#404040">(list_stairs)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, the list of visible objects (accessible 
  in-game by pressing O) will include stairs in its Interesting 
  Features section. (The inclusion of stairs in the object list can be 
  toggled in the list itself by pressing S, but this option determines 
  whether stairs are shown by default.)
  
<a name="display_skill_num"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Display skills as numbers in the character sheet </font><font color="#404040">(display_skill_num)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is on, the character sheet displays the player's 
  skills numerically in addition to the usual verbal description; 
  </font><font color="#008040">Superb </font><font color="#ffffff">may become </font><font color="#008040">Superb </font><font color="#ffffff">(82), for example. This format is familiar 
  to players of Composband, where the numerical display is always on.
  
<a name="reforge_details"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Show statistics before proceeding with a reforge </font><font color="#404040">(reforge_details)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option shows statistics about how good a reforge result is 
  likely to be (and why), gives warnings in case of reforges that look 
  particularly misguided, and allows you to cancel the reforge if the 
  statistics are not to your liking.
  
<a name="auto_sticky_labels"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Automatically make all power labels sticky </font><font color="#404040">(auto_sticky_labels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option on, all powers used through the 'U' key ('O' in the 
  roguelike keyset) will be assigned a permanent and unchanging letter 
  slot, allowing reliable macros and keymaps (and finger memory).
  
  
<a name="GamePlay"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Game Play Options
  
<a name="stack_force_notes"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Merge inscriptions when stacking </font><font color="#404040">(stack_force_notes)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty 
  inscription and the other does not. The resulting stack keeps the 
  non-empty inscription.
  
<a name="stack_force_costs"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Merge discounts when stacking </font><font color="#404040">(stack_force_costs)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have 
  different discounts. The resulting stack keeps the largest discount. 
  This option may cause you to lose "value", but will give you optimal 
  pack usage.
  
<a name="expand_list"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Expand the power of the list commands </font><font color="#404040">(expand_list)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Expand the "listing" commands so that they "wrap" at the "edges" of 
  the appropriate list. This allows the "look" and "target" commands to 
  "cycle" through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify 
  symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.
  
<a name="empty_levels"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Allow empty 'arena' levels </font><font color="#404040">(empty_levels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Normal dungeon levels consist mostly of rock. If this option is in 
  use, levels which have empty floor instead of solid rock may also be 
  created (somewhat reminiscent of Nethack's "big-room" levels). These 
  levels can be extremely deadly, especially with breathing monsters 
  (since there are few obstructions to shield). Arena levels may have 
  vaults, nests and pits in them like normal levels. Some arena levels 
  are dark when they are created, but most are lit.
  
<a name="bound_walls_perm"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Boundary walls become 'permanent wall' </font><font color="#404040">(bound_walls_perm)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is set, boundaries of dungeon floors will explicitly 
  look like permanent walls. If unset, those will look like normal 
  walls, but still behave as permanent walls.
  
<a name="last_words"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Leave last words when your character dies </font><font color="#404040">(last_words)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display a random line from the "death.txt" file when your character 
  dies and then allow you to rewrite these last words. If this option 
  is not selected, the "You die." message is displayed instead.
  
<a name="allow_debug_opts"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Allow use of debug/cheat options </font><font color="#404040">(allow_debug_opts)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Since use of debug command(^A), wizard mode(^W), and Cheating options 
  ('C' in options panel) mark the player as "Cheater" who can't 
  register their score, these debug/cheat options are forbidden by 
  default. The allow_debug_opts option removes these restrictions, and 
  allow the player to become "Cheater". But perhaps you just want to 
  test?
  
<a name="Disturbance"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Disturbance Options
  
<a name="find_ignore_stairs"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Run past stairs </font><font color="#404040">(find_ignore_stairs)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Ignore stairs when running.
  
<a name="find_ignore_doors"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Run through open doors </font><font color="#404040">(find_ignore_doors)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Ignore open doors when running.
  
<a name="find_ignore_veins"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Run past buried treasure </font><font color="#404040">(find_ignore_veins)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Ignore treasure veins when running.
  
<a name="find_cut"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Run past known corners </font><font color="#404040">(find_cut)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Cut sharply around known corners when running. This will result in 
  faster running, but may cause you to run into a lurking monster.
  
<a name="check_abort"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Check for user abort while continuous command </font><font color="#404040">(check_abort)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Turning this option off will avoid checking to see if the user has 
  pressed a key during resting or running or repeated commands. This 
  not only makes the game much more efficient (on many systems), but 
  also allows the use of certain obscure macro sequences, such as 
  turning this option off, resting until done, turning this option on, 
  and casting a spell. Resting for long periods of time with this 
  option turned off is dangerous since the resting may not stop until 
  the user takes damage from starvation.
  
<a name="flush_failure"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Flush input on various failures </font><font color="#404040">(flush_failure)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever 
  various "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to 
  use a wand, etc. This is very useful if you use macros which include 
  "directional" components with commands that can fail, since it will 
  prevent you from walking towards monsters when your spells fail.
  
<a name="prompt_on_failure"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Give -more- prompts on device/spell failures </font><font color="#404040">(prompt_on_failure)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces a </font><font color="#00ffff">-more- </font><font color="#ffffff">prompt whenever an attempt to use a 
  device or cast a spell fails. This is useful if the player is in the 
  habit of pressing keys (e.g. to target the device) on the assumption 
  the device won't fail, which if unchecked can result in a potentially 
  costly lost turn when the device does fail.
  
<a name="flush_disturb"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Flush input whenever disturbed </font><font color="#404040">(flush_disturb)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the 
  character is "disturbed". This is useful if you use macros which take 
  time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while 
  being attacked by a monster.
  
<a name="disturb_move"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disturb whenever any monster moves </font><font color="#404040">(disturb_move)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears. 
  This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so 
  you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near 
  such monsters.
  
<a name="disturb_high"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disturb whenever high-level monster moves </font><font color="#404040">(disturb_high)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Disturb the player when any monster whose level is higher than the 
  player moves, appears, or disappears. This includes monsters which 
  are only visible due to telepathy.
  
<a name="disturb_near"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disturb whenever viewable monster moves </font><font color="#404040">(disturb_near)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any 
  monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any 
  viewable monster becomes no longer viewable. This option ignores the 
  existence of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether a 
  monster is "viewable". See also the "view_reduce_view" option.
  
<a name="disturb_pets"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disturb when visible pets move </font><font color="#404040">(disturb_pets)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not apply 
  to pets: for example, it can be annoying if your rest is always 
  disturbed by a pet dog who pops in every now and then. By default, 
  pets do not disturb you even if full monster disturbance options are 
  set. If you want your pets to disturb you like normal monsters, set 
  this option.
  
<a name="disturb_panel"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disturb whenever map panel changes </font><font color="#404040">(disturb_panel)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes you to be disturbed by the map scrolling, as it 
  does automatically when you get close to the edge of the screen.
  
<a name="disturb_state"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disturb whenever player state changes </font><font color="#404040">(disturb_state)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state 
  changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.
  
<a name="disturb_minor"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disturb whenever boring things happen </font><font color="#404040">(disturb_minor)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes you to be disturbed by various boring things, 
  including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and 
  beginning to run out of fuel.
  
<a name="town_no_disturb"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Never disturb when a town monster moves </font><font color="#404040">(town_no_disturb)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option on, non-attacking moves by monsters native to towns 
  (mercenaries, drunks, street urchins etc.) will never disturb you.
  
<a name="ring_bell"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Audible bell (on errors, etc) </font><font color="#404040">(ring_bell)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Attempt to make a bell noise when various errors occur.
  
<a name="disturb_trap_detect"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Disturb when leaving trap detected area </font><font color="#404040">(disturb_trap_detect)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes you to be disturbed when the player is running out 
  of trap-detected area.
  
<a name="alert_trap_detect"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Alert when leaving trap detected area </font><font color="#404040">(alert_trap_detect)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option alerts you with a message when the player is moving out 
  of the trap-detected area.
  
<a name="alert_device_gone"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Alert when carried device is destroyed or stolen </font><font color="#404040">(alert_device_gone)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces a </font><font color="#00ffff">-more- </font><font color="#ffffff">prompt whenever any wand, rod or staff in 
  your inventory is destroyed or stolen.
  
<a name="alert_insc_gone"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Alert when inscribed item is destroyed or stolen </font><font color="#404040">(alert_insc_gone)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces a </font><font color="#00ffff">-more- </font><font color="#ffffff">prompt whenever any inscribed item in 
  your inventory is destroyed or stolen.
  
<a name="alert_wanted_kill"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Alert on killing wanted uniques </font><font color="#404040">(alert_wanted_kill)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces a </font><font color="#00ffff">-more- </font><font color="#ffffff">prompt when a unique with a price on its 
  head is killed.
  
<a name="alert_poison"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Alert on dangerously high poison counter </font><font color="#404040">(alert_poison)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option alerts you with a message before your move if your poison 
  counter exceeds your current HP, 80% of your maximum HP, or 499 
  points, whichever is lowest. (Subsequent warnings for the same 
  instance of poisoning will be displayed only if you are at immediate 
  risk of dying from poison.)
  
  
<a name="AutoDestroyer"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Easy Auto-Destroyer Options
  
<a name="destroy_items"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Use easy auto-destroyer </font><font color="#404040">(destroy_items)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option turns The Easy Destroyer on and off. If enabled, The Easy 
  Destroyer will destroy all objects unless the object is protected by 
  one or more of the leave_* options discussed below.
  
    </font><font color="#00ff00">Note: The </font><font color="#ff0000">Easy Auto-Destroyer </font><font color="#00ff00">is a simpler to use 
    version of the full featured </font><font color="#ff0000">Mogaminator </font><font color="#00ff00">discussed in <a href="editor.html">
    [i]</a>. It is designed for those who feel the full version 
    is too complicated to use. However, you really should 
    only use one or the other. So if you are using the full 
    version, then you should not also enable the easy 
    version, unless you have turned on the </font><font color="#ff0000">always_pickup 
    </font><font color="#00ff00">option.
  
<a name="destroy_feeling"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Apply auto-destroy on sensing an item </font><font color="#404040">(destroy_feeling)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy 
  Destroyer will take actions whenever the player senses the quality of 
  an object (i.e., whenever pseudo-id kicks in).
  
<a name="destroy_identify"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Apply auto-destroy on identifying an item </font><font color="#404040">(destroy_identify)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy 
  Destroyer will take actions whenever the player identifies an object, 
  whether with a spell or with a magical device (but, alas, not via a 
  town service).
  
<a name="destroy_debug"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">List the rule used when applying the Mogaminator </font><font color="#404040">(destroy_debug)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This is a debugging option when using the full-featured Mogaminator. 
  Enabling this option results in the reporting of the rule used 
  whenever an action is taken, such as pickup, auto-identify or 
  destroy. The rule in question will appear in the message line. For 
  example:
    You have 26 charges remaining. </font><font color="#00ffff">(AutoID:</font><font color="#ffffff">~?</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff0000">rods</font><font color="#00ffff">) </font><font color="#ffffff">You see </font><font color="#ff00ff">a 
    Rod: </font><font color="#c0c0c0">Frost Ball </font><font color="#ff00ff">(</font><font color="#ffff00">1/3 charges</font><font color="#ff00ff">)</font><font color="#ffffff">. </font><font color="#00ffff">(Destroy:</font><font color="#ffffff">(!</font><font color="#ff0000">rods</font><font color="#ffffff">:frost ball$</font><font color="#00ffff">)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">Auto-destroying.
  
  In addition, the matching rule will be displayed when inspecting 
  objects. For example:
    </font><font color="#ff8000">an Amulet (Defender) [+12]
      </font><font color="#ffffff">Resist </font><font color="#008040">Acid</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#0000ff">Electricity</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#c00000">Fire</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#c0c0c0">Cold</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#00ff00">Poison
      </font><font color="#ff0000">Free Action</font><font color="#ffffff">; </font><font color="#00ffff">See Invisible</font><font color="#ffffff">; </font><font color="#00ffff">Levitation
      It cannot be harmed by the elements.
      </font><font color="#c00000">Autopick: </font><font color="#ffffff">~</font><font color="#00ff00">*identified* </font><font color="#ff0000">amulets </font><font color="#ff8000">more value than 10000
  
<a name="no_mogaminator"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Never apply the Mogaminator </font><font color="#404040">(no_mogaminator)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option deactivates the Mogaminator. (It is redundant if the 
  Mogaminator was never activated in the first place.)
  
<a name="delay_autopick"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Allow manual pickup before applying auto-pickup </font><font color="#404040">(delay_autopick)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option on, any command that allows you to pick up items 
  manually will give the manual pickup priority over auto-pickup. (With 
  the option off, this only happens if you are picking up items from 
  the square you were already on.)
  
<a name="leave_worth"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Auto-destroyer leaves known worthy items </font><font color="#404040">(leave_worth)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option protects known objects that can be sold in stores from 
  auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer.
  
<a name="leave_equip"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Auto-destroyer leaves weapons and armor </font><font color="#404040">(leave_equip)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option protects all weapons and armor from auto-destruction by 
  The Easy Destroyer.
  
<a name="leave_chest"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Auto-destroyer leaves closed chests </font><font color="#404040">(leave_chest)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option protects all chests which are not yet opened from 
  auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer.
  
<a name="leave_wanted"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Auto-destroyer leaves wanted corpses </font><font color="#404040">(leave_wanted)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option protects corpses of monsters wanted at the Hunter's 
  office from auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer.
  
<a name="leave_corpse"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Auto-destroyer leaves corpses and skeletons </font><font color="#404040">(leave_corpse)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option protects all corpses and skeletons from auto-destruction 
  by The Easy Destroyer.
  
<a name="leave_junk"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Auto-destroyer leaves junk </font><font color="#404040">(leave_junk)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option protects all 'junk', such as Shards of Pottery or Broken 
  Stick, from auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer. This is 
  especially helpful for Archers.
  
<a name="leave_special"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Auto-destroyer leaves items your race/class needs </font><font color="#404040">(leave_special)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option protects specific items which are normally worthless, but 
  very important for specific classes or races. These include bones for 
  Archers, ego light sources of darkness for Ninja, Wands of Heal 
  Monster for BeastMaster and Cavalry, and humanoid corpses for 
  Balrogs, etc...
  
<a name="BaseDelay"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Base Delay Factor

</font><font color="#ffffff">The </font><font color="#ff0000">delay_factor </font><font color="#ffffff">value, if non-zero, is used to slow down the game, 
which is useful to allow you to observe the animations of bolt, beam, 
and ball attacks. The actual delay is equal to delay_factor cubed, in 
milliseconds.

<a name="Hitpoint"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Hitpoint Warning

</font><font color="#ffffff">The </font><font color="#ff0000">hitpoint_warn </font><font color="#ffffff">value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal 
hitpoints at which the player is warned that he may die. It is also 
used as the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.

<a name="Autosave"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Autosave Options

</font><font color="#ffffff">Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not needed 
at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which it, to be 
frank, probably is not), the user might forget to save and his hardware 
could fail him. For all of these reasons, you may want to use these 
options:
  
<a name="autosave_l"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Autosave when entering new levels </font><font color="#404040">(autosave_l)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your 
  character every time before creating a new dungeon level.
  
<a name="autosave_t"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Timed autosave </font><font color="#404040">(autosave_t)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your 
  character every n game turns, where n is the "frequency". To set the 
  frequency press </font><font color="#ff8000">F</font><font color="#ffffff">. It will increase the frequency to the next 
  category (and from 25000 to 0), the categories being every 50, 100, 
  250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 and 25000 turns. Note that the 
  frequency must be higher than 0 and the "Timed autosave" set to "yes" 
  for timed autosaves to take place.
  
<a name="Window"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Window Flags

</font><font color="#ffffff">These options select what kind of information is displayed in which 
window. Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which 
can be used to display useful information generally available through 
other means. The best thing about these windows is that they are 
updated automatically (usually) to reflect the current state of the 
world. The "window options" can be used to specify what should be 
displayed in each window. The possible choices should be pretty 
obvious.
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display inven/equip
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the player inventory (and sometimes the equipment). Note that 
  you can toggle between Inventory and Equipment by pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">^I</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display equip/inven
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the player equipment (and sometimes the inventory). Note that 
  you can toggle between Inventory and Equipment by pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">^I</font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display Object List
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option displays the results of the </font><font color="#ff0000">Object List </font><font color="#ffffff">command (</font><font color="#ff8000">]</font><font color="#ffffff">). For 
  example:
  
    There is 1 wanted object:
     </font><font color="#404040">! </font><font color="#00ffff">a Potion of Resistance               </font><font color="#ffffff">S 17 E 29
  
    There are 4 other objects:
     </font><font color="#c0c0c0">| </font><font color="#ffffff">a Two-Handed Sword (3d6)             S 18 E 30
     </font><font color="#404040">\ </font><font color="#ffffff">a Lead-Filled Mace (3d4)             S 18 E 28
     </font><font color="#808080">] </font><font color="#c08040">a Pair of Metal Shod Boots [6]       </font><font color="#ffffff">S 18 E 29
     </font><font color="#808080">/ </font><font color="#ffffff">an Awl-Pike (1d8)                    S 19 E 29
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display Monster List
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option displays the results of the </font><font color="#ff0000">Monster List </font><font color="#ffffff">command (</font><font color="#ff8000">[</font><font color="#ffffff">). For 
  example:
  
    You are aware of 4 monsters, 4 are awake:
     </font><font color="#ff8000">t </font><font color="#ffffff">Aimless looking merchant (2 awake)
     </font><font color="#404040">t </font><font color="#ffffff">Agent of black market                N  9 W 54
     </font><font color="#ffff00">t </font><font color="#ffffff">Singing, happy drunk                 S 22 E 72
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display messages
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the most recently generated messages (cf The </font><font color="#ff8000">^P </font><font color="#ffffff">command).
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display overhead view
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display an overhead view of the entire dungeon. This is very slow and 
  gives the same results as the </font><font color="#ff8000">M </font><font color="#ffffff">command.
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display monster recall
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display a description of the most monster which has been most 
  recently attacked, targeted, or examined in some way.
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display object recall
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display a description of the most recently selected object. Currently 
  this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks. This window flag may be 
  usefully combined with others, such as "monster recall".
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display dungeon view
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display a copy of dungeon map.
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display borg messages
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not 
  currently supported in this variant.
  
  </font><font color="#c08040">Display borg status
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not 
  currently supported in this variant.
  
<a name="Cheating"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Cheating Options

</font><font color="#ffffff">Using the cheating options marks your character as "Cheater" and you 
won't get into the high-score list. Turning off the cheating options 
later does NOT allow your character to get a highscore entry, so think 
twice before using any cheat.
  
<a name="cheat_peek"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Peek into object creation </font><font color="#404040">(cheat_peek)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Cheaters never win. But they can peek at object creation.
  
<a name="cheat_hear"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Peek into monster creation </font><font color="#404040">(cheat_hear)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Cheaters never win. But they can peek at monster creation.

<a name="cheat_save"></a>  </font><font color="#c08040">Ask for saving death </font><font color="#404040">(cheat_save)

  character data or not when they die.
