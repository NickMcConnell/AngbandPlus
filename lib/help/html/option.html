<font color="#00c8ff">Options and Effects

</font><font color="#ffffff">Most of the </font><font color="#ff4040">options </font><font color="#ffffff">are accessible through the </font><font color="#ff9200">= </font><font color="#ffffff">command, which 
provides an interface to the various sets of options available to the 
player.

In the descriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary 
which is shown on the options screen, plus the internal name of the 
option in parenthesis, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref 
files to force the option to a given setting (see <a href="pref.html#Options"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more info).

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including 
</font><font color="#ff4040">disturb </font><font color="#ffffff">(cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are 
in progress), </font><font color="#ff4040">flush </font><font color="#ffffff">(forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress 
queue, including any macros in progress), and </font><font color="#ff4040">fresh </font><font color="#ffffff">(dump any pending 
output to the screen).

<a name="Birth"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Birth options

</font><font color="#ffffff">The birth options can only be accessed while creating a new character 
(press </font><font color="#ff9200">= </font><font color="#ffffff">while creating the character). There is no way to turn them 
off after the creation is finished!
  
<a name="easy_id"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Easy Identify </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(easy_id)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option simplifies the identification of objects, making Identify 
  work just like *Identify*. However, this renders many spells (such as 
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Stone Tell </font><font color="#ffffff">in Nature and </font><font color="#ff4040">Identify True </font><font color="#ffffff">in Sorcery) and objects (such 
  as </font><font color="#ff4040">Staves of *Identify*</font><font color="#ffffff">) redundant or pointless. Also, some classes 
  (such as the Archaeologist) are designed with early access to 
  *Identify* as a principle bonus. Enabling this option removes the 
  advantages of these classes, making them less worthy of playing.
  
  In addition, this birth option will also affect the early game 
  pseudo-identification of objects. Normally, objects must be carried 
  in your pack for some time before you become aware of their quality. 
  The length of time is class dependent, as is the amount of 
  information revealed through pseudo-identification (see <a href="objects.html#Pseudo-ID"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">). With 
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Easy Identify </font><font color="#ffffff">enabled, all players will get instantaneous and full 
  pseudo-identification of objects, making this aspect of gameplay much 
  easier as well.
  
<a name="easy_lore"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Easy Lore </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(easy_lore)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the player will be born with complete 
  knowledge of monster lore, including the various attacks and nasty 
  surprises that many monsters usually offer to the uninitiated. This 
  is a bit of a spoiler option, but is available for those who don't 
  enjoy learning each of the many monsters present in the game. Like 
  the </font><font color="#ffcc80">Easy Identify </font><font color="#ffffff">option, </font><font color="#ffcc80">Easy Lore </font><font color="#ffffff">also renders a few aspects of the 
  game non-functional or pointless, including the ability to </font><font color="#ff4040">Probe 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">monsters to learn about them as you encounter them, and the town 
  </font><font color="#ff4040">Beastmaster Lore </font><font color="#ffffff">service to learn about monsters before you see them 
  (for a price, of course).
  
<a name="smart_learn"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Monsters learn from their mistakes </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(smart_learn)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to, and 
  to use this information to choose the best attacks.
  
<a name="smart_cheat"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Monsters exploit players weaknesses </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(smart_cheat)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, and 
  to use this information to choose the best attacks.
  
<a name="no_wilderness"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Play without a wilderness </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(no_wilderness)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option disables the wilderness, forcing you to play with a 
  single special town level. As a result, the only dungeon that will be 
  available is the </font><font color="#ff4040">Pits of Angband</font><font color="#ffffff">. However, the town is relatively 
  well serviced and many, if not most, of the various fixed quests will 
  be available for your pleasure (see <a href="town.html#NoWilderness"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).
  
<a name="ironman_shops"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Stores are permanently closed </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(ironman_shops)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option closes all shops. Try to survive in the deeps of the 
  dungeon without supplies from town. Your Home still functions 
  normally, and various town services are still available.
  
<a name="ironman_small_levels"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Always create unusually small dungeon levels </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(ironman_small_levels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than 
  usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option below.
  
<a name="ironman_downward"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disable recall and use of up stairs </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(ironman_downward)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">You are not allowed to climb upwards, or recall to town. All stairs 
  are downstairs and every time you teleport level, you'll teleport to 
  a deeper level.
  
<a name="ironman_empty_levels"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Always create empty 'arena' levels </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(ironman_empty_levels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, then every level will be empty 'arena' 
  level. See the "Allow empty 'arena' levels" option below.
  
<a name="ironman_rooms"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Always generate very unusual rooms </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(ironman_rooms)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, every room becomes a vault. It is unclear 
  whether this makes the game harder or easier.
  
<a name="ironman_nightmare"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Nightmare mode(it isn't even remotely fair!) </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(ironman_nightmare)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, all monsters become unusually powerful, 
  and fast. And there will be various unbelievable things happening in 
  various situations. Furthermore, at 12:00 every night, you will have 
  a real nightmare. You need to be crazy to turn this option on!
  
<a name="preserve_mode"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Preserve artifacts </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(preserve_mode)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">In non-preserve mode, once a fixed artifact is generated (either on 
  the dungeon floor or in a monster drop), it will never be generated 
  again during that game. This means that if you miss the artifact by 
  leaving the level before you pick it up it is gone forever. On the 
  other hand, in preserve mode this behavior is only exhibited once you 
  have identified the artifact. It is therefor safer to leave a level 
  before it is completely explored as any fixed artifact can be 
  regenerated in subsequent levels.
  
  
<a name="Input"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Input Options
  
<a name="rogue_like_commands"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Rogue-like commands </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(rogue_like_commands)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Selects the </font><font color="#ff4040">roguelike </font><font color="#ffffff">command set which is an alternative way of 
  mapping keystrokes to underlying game commands. (see <a href="command.html#RogueKeyset"></font><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for info).
  
<a name="always_pickup"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Pick things up by default </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(always_pickup)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it 
  up. Otherwise, you must use the </font><font color="#ff9200">g </font><font color="#ffffff">command, or the </font><font color="#ff9200">- </font><font color="#ffffff">command while 
  walking. Combined with </font><font color="#ff4040">carry_query_flag</font><font color="#ffffff">, allows you to selectively 
  pick up all items which you step on.
  
<a name="quick_messages"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Activate quick messages </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(quick_messages)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the </font><font color="#00c8ff">-more- </font><font color="#ffffff">prompt 
  (useful for monster farming). Allows most keys to mean "no" to any 
  "(y/n)" prompt.
  
<a name="command_menu"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Enable command selection menu </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(command_menu)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The command selection menu is a helpful tool for beginning players. 
  By pressing </font><font color="#ff9200">ENTER</font><font color="#ffffff">, this option displays a menu of all available 
  commands, which the user may drill into with the arrow keys. This 
  makes it easier to discover the keypress required to do a specific 
  action:
  
    +----------------------------------------------------+
    |   Magic/Special         &gt; Action                   |

            +----------------------------------------------------+
  
  
<a name="use_old_target"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use old target by default </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(use_old_target)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces all commands which normally ask for a </font><font color="#ff4040">direction </font><font color="#ffffff">to 
  use the current </font><font color="#ff4040">target </font><font color="#ffffff">if there is one. Use of this option can be 
  dangerous if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear 
  them when done. Actually, position targets now automatically clear 
  when they are no longer valid (e.g. after a teleport). Pay attention 
  to the character info section of your screen as it always shows your 
  current target, whether monster or location.
  
<a name="auto_target"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Automatically target nearest monster </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(auto_target)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, every offensive spell you cast or device 
  you use will automatically target the closest monster if there is not 
  already a valid target selected. If you use this option, then it is 
  highly recommended that you also enable the </font><font color="#ff4040">use_old_target </font><font color="#ffffff">option. 
  That way, if you are in a situation where the automatic targeting is 
  not what you want, you can just select a target up front before 
  casting your spell.
  
<a name="always_repeat"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Repeat obvious commands </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(always_repeat)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Tells the game that when you attempt to </font><font color="#ff4040">open </font><font color="#ffffff">a door or chest, </font><font color="#ff4040">bash </font><font color="#ffffff">a 
  door, </font><font color="#ff4040">tunnel </font><font color="#ffffff">through walls, or </font><font color="#ff4040">disarm </font><font color="#ffffff">traps or chests, that you wish 
  to repeat the command 99 times (see <a href="command.html#CommandCounts"></font><font color="#00ff00">[e]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).
  
<a name="confirm_destroy"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Prompt for destruction of known worthless items </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(confirm_destroy)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Normally, no confirmation will be asked if you attempt to destroy an 
  object which you know to be worthless. If this option is set, the 
  Destroy command always asks for confirmation.
  
<a name="confirm_wear"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Confirm to wear/wield known cursed items </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(confirm_wear)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find 
  themselves wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this option 
  is set, you should be safe from such typing mistakes: you will be 
  prompted if you attempt to wear or wield an item if your character 
  knows it is cursed.
  
<a name="confirm_quest"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Prompt before exiting a quest level </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(confirm_quest)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">In the dungeon, you can freely climb up/down stairs and can return to 
  former floors normally. But in some quest level, including the random 
  quest, you can not return once you escaped from the level. If this 
  option is set, the program asks for confirmation before you go up the 
  stairs from such quest levels.
  
<a name="target_pet"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Allow targetting pets </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(target_pet)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Normally, the program doesn't automatically choose pets as target in 
  the targeting mode of attack spells. If this option is set, the 
  program always chooses every monster in sight as target.
  
<a name="easy_open"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Automatically open doors </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(easy_open)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Makes it easy for your character to open a door: simply by walking 
  into it! Also the open command will automatically select one 
  direction if only one door is near you.
  
<a name="easy_disarm"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Automatically disarm traps </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(easy_disarm)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Makes it easy for your character disarms a trap: simply by walking 
  into it! Also the disarm command will automatically select one 
  direction if only one known trap is near you.
  
<a name="auto_get_ammo"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Automatically get nearby ammo </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(auto_get_ammo)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option instructs the Auto-Get Objects command (</font><font color="#ff9200">^G</font><font color="#ffffff">) to 
  automatically travel to nearby, visible ammo which is inscribed with 
  </font><font color="#ff9200">=g </font><font color="#ffffff">(i.e., ammo which you have instructed the autopicker to 
  automatically pickup). This enhancement is useful for archer builds 
  after all nearby monsters have been slain. You might consider using 
  the stronger </font><font color="#ff4040">auto_get_objects </font><font color="#ffffff">option instead.
  
<a name="auto_get_objects"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Automatically get nearby objects </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(auto_get_objects)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option instructs the Auto-Get Objects command (</font><font color="#ff9200">^G</font><font color="#ffffff">) to 
  automatically travel to nearby visible objects which you have 
  registered to either pickup or destroy. This option subsumes (and 
  extends) the </font><font color="#ff4040">auto_get_ammo </font><font color="#ffffff">option since ammo inscribed with </font><font color="#ff9200">=g </font><font color="#ffffff">is 
  certainly registered for auto-pickup.
  
<a name="auto_detect_traps"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Automatically detect traps while running </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(auto_detect_traps)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the game will attempt to automatically 
  detect traps whenever you run outside a trap-detected region. Use the 
  </font><font color="#ff4040">view_unsafe_grids </font><font color="#ffffff">to make trap detected regions more visually 
  obvious. For this option to work, you must be carrying a scroll, 
  staff or rod able to detect traps. The game will use the object for 
  you automatically, consuming a scroll or a single charge from an 
  appropriate device.
  
<a name="auto_map_area"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Automatically map area while running </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(auto_map_area)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the game will attempt to automatically map 
  your surroundings whenever you run outside a previously mapped zone. 
  Unlike </font><font color="#ff4040">auto_detect_traps</font><font color="#ffffff">, there is no visual indication of regions 
  that are flagged as mapped versus those that are not. When you invoke 
  magic mapping, the game maps your surroundings, and it also sets a 
  flag on each tile in the area of effect. When your player runs from a 
  tile so flagged onto one not so flagged, then the game attempts to 
  automatically map for you by locating an appropriate scroll or device 
  and using it for you. Both this option and </font><font color="#ff4040">auto_detect_traps </font><font color="#ffffff">work 
  best if you always run when travelling about. When you enter a new 
  level, manually detect traps and map your surroundings. If you always 
  run when travelling, the game will automatically take care of the 
  detection tedium for the rest of the level.
  
<a name="numpad_as_cursorkey"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use numpad keys as cursor keys in editor mode </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(numpad_as_cursorkey)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option makes numpad keys work as cursor movement keys while text 
  editing mode. Which include auto-picker editor, inputing an 
  inscription, a macro action, and etc.
  
<a name="use_pack_slots"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use and Display Inventory Slots </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(use_pack_slots)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option, the object prompt will use and display the current 
  inventory slot for objects in question. For example, if your food 
  happens to currently be in slot h), the the </font><font color="#ff9200">E</font><font color="#ffffff">at command will require 
  you to press </font><font color="#ff9200">h </font><font color="#ffffff">to use this item. Without this option, each object 
  prompt will begin labels at a). Some players prefer to keep the 
  inventory slot, even though it constantly shifts as you add and 
  remove new objects to your pack. Other players prefer to have 
  commands use the same labels for the same objects upon successive 
  calls (For example, pick up a spellbook and your food is now in the 
  i) slot. This may puzzle you, since the last time you were hungry you 
  pressed </font><font color="#ff9200">Eh</font><font color="#ffffff">, but now you need to press </font><font color="#ff9200">Ei</font><font color="#ffffff">. With this option turned 
  off, eating rations of food will always be </font><font color="#ff9200">Ea </font><font color="#ffffff">... at least until you 
  pick up some mushrooms! However, if you do, then your eye will 
  quickly perceive the presence of two items in the object prompt next 
  time you </font><font color="#ff9200">E</font><font color="#ffffff">at).
  
<a name="MapScreen"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Map &amp; Screen Options
  
<a name="center_player"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Center map while walking </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(center_player)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option enabled, the map window automatically recenters on 
  the player as you walk. I find this rather disturbing, but it helps 
  if you are on a small monitor and worried about off screen monsters.
  
<a name="center_running"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Centering even while running </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(center_running)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Normally, the map does not center on the player if the player moves 
  with the "run" command, only when the running finishes. If this 
  option is set, the map always centers on the player.
  
<a name="view_yellow_lite"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use special colors for torch-lit grids </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(view_yellow_lite)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids in 
  certain situations (see the entries for"view_granite_lite" and 
  "view_special_lite"). Turning this option off will slightly improve 
  game speed.
  
<a name="view_bright_lite"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use special colors for 'viewable' grids </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(view_bright_lite)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable" grids 
  in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and 
  "view_special_lite"). When this option is set, floor grids which are 
  normally drawn in "white" but which are not currently "viewable" by 
  the player are instead drawn in "dark gray". This makes the 
  "viewable" grids to appear "brighter" than the others, allowing the 
  player to easily determine which floor grids are in "line of sight". 
  Turning this option off will probably increase the speed of the game.
  
<a name="view_granite_lite"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use special colors for wall grids </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(view_granite_lite)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids 
  which are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally 
  are). When the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid 
  is torch-lit, we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the 
  "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the "view_bright_lite" option is 
  set, and the grid is not in line of sight, or the grid is dark, or 
  the grid is only "partially" lit, then we use "gray", otherwise we 
  use the normal "white". Turning this option off will probably 
  increase the speed of the game. This option may not work well if the 
  attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed.
  
<a name="view_special_lite"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use special colors for floor grids </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(view_special_lite)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids 
  which are normally drawn in "white" (as they normally are). When the 
  player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit, 
  we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" 
  option, else if the grid is "dark", we use "dark gray", else if the 
  "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line of 
  sight, we use "gray", otherwise we use the normal "white". Turning 
  this option off will probably increase the speed of the game. This 
  option may not work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have 
  been changed
  
<a name="view_perma_grids"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Map remembers all perma-lit grids </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(view_perma_grids)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player. This 
  option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids were 
  perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids, 
  unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids. Turning off this option 
  allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line of 
  sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite" 
  option. Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player are 
  always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is 
  memorized independently from the memorization of the grid itself.
  
<a name="view_torch_grids"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Map remembers all torch-lit grids </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(view_torch_grids)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player. 
  This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids 
  have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use 
  of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display of 
  floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray","lit" 
  grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite" option is 
  set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in 
  "orange". Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit" are 
  considered to be "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless the 
  "view_yellow_lite" option is set, in which case they are drawn in 
  "yellow".
  
<a name="view_unsafe_grids"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Map marked by detect traps </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(view_unsafe_grids)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a 
  detect trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This 
  allows you to determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect 
  traps, but does not ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x' are 
  trap free. This option has no effect on surface grids, but outdoor 
  locations cannot be trapped.
  
<a name="fresh_before"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Flush output while continuous command </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(fresh_before)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all output before every command. 
  This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game 
  somewhat. Note that this option is only useful when using macros, 
  resting, running, or repeating commands, since the output is always 
  flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the user.
  
<a name="fresh_after"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Flush output after monster's move </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(fresh_after)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all output after not only every 
  player command, but also after every round of processing monsters and 
  objects, which will give you maximal information, but may slow down 
  the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on faster machines 
  you normally do not have a chance to see the results anyway.
  
<a name="fresh_message"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Flush output after every message </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(fresh_message)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all output after every message 
  displayed by the game. This will give you maximal information, but 
  may slow down the game somewhat.
  
<a name="hilite_player"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Hilite the player with the cursor </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(hilite_player)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Place the visible cursor on the player. This looks fine on some Unix 
  machines, but horrible on most graphics machines. Note that only some 
  machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, 
  hiding the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.
  
<a name="display_path"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Display actual path before shooting </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(display_path)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">When this option is set, the targeting mode will show path from you 
  to current target point continuously.
  
<a name="TextDisplay"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Text Display Options
  
<a name="plain_descriptions"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Plain object descriptions </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(plain_descriptions)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option disables "full" names for identified 'flavored' objects, 
  in other words, if this option is not in use, an identified Potion of 
  Speed could be listed (for example) as a Blue Potion of Speed. If you 
  prefer simpler, less verbose descriptions, set this option.
  
<a name="always_show_list"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Always show list when choosing items </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(always_show_list)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">When this option is set, all commands which lets you to choose an 
  item from inventory or equipment list will automatically show list 
  when activated.
  
<a name="depth_in_feet"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Show dungeon level in feet </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(depth_in_feet)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as an actual level. 
  This also affects the monster memory display.
  
<a name="show_labels"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Show labels in object listings </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(show_labels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the labels for objects in the equipment list, and in any 
  special window which is displaying the equipment. These labels 
  indicate what the player is using the object for, such as "wielding" 
  or "wearing" (in a given location). After you have played for a 
  while, this information is no longer useful, and can be annoying.
  
<a name="show_weights"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Show weights in object listings </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(show_weights)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the weights of objects in the inventory and equipment lists, 
  and in stores, and in any special window which is displaying any of 
  these lists.
  
<a name="show_discounts"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Show discounts in object listings </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(show_discounts)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display the discount of the object, if any, as part of its 
  inscription. Disabling this option won't remove the object's 
  discount. Rather, this information will no longer be displayed to the 
  player.
  
<a name="show_item_graph"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Show items graphics </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(show_item_graph)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Displays small icons of the items in your inventory list, equipment 
  list and stores.
  
<a name="equippy_chars"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Display 'equippy' chars </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(equippy_chars)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option will show you a graphical representation of your worn 
  equipment on the main screen. The 'equippy' chars will use the 
  standard symbols of the respective items.
  
<a name="display_hp_bar"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Display player hp bar </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(display_hp_bar)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current health. For example:
    @[</font><font color="#fffd00">*******</font><font color="#ffffff">--]
  
<a name="display_sp_bar"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Display player sp bar </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(display_sp_bar)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current mana. For example:
    </font><font color="#e0e0e0">?</font><font color="#ffffff">[</font><font color="#c00000">***</font><font color="#ffffff">------]
  
<a name="display_food_bar"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Display detailed food status </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(display_food_bar)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current state of hunger. For example:
    </font><font color="#ffcc80">,</font><font color="#ffffff">[</font><font color="#ff4040">**</font><font color="#ffffff">-------]
  
<a name="compress_savefile"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Compress messages in savefiles </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(compress_savefile)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages" that 
  the player has received. This can cut the size of the savefile by a 
  drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.
  
<a name="abbrev_extra"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Describe obj's extra resistances by abbreviation </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(abbrev_extra)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string 
  for the object's extra resitances and extra abilities are added as 
  fake inscriptions of the object.
  
  A word "EXTRA" means that the ability must not be obvious from the 
  objects name. For example, a pair of boots of Levitation sometimes 
  has EXTRA shard resistance. But fire resistance of an armor of Resist 
  Fire is not an EXTRA resistance.
  
  The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are 
  described in <a href="objects.html#InscriptionAbbrev"></font><font color="#00ff00">[f]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
<a name="abbrev_all"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Describe obj's all resistances by abbreviation </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(abbrev_all)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string 
  for all the object's resitances and abilities are added as fake 
  inscriptions of the object.
  
  The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are 
  described in <a href="objects.html#InscriptionAbbrev"></font><font color="#00ff00">[g]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">.
  
<a name="exp_need"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Show the experience needed for the next level </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(exp_need)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Setting this option to yes alters the display of experience on the 
  left of the main screen to the experience needed to reach the next 
  character level, instead of the character's current total experience.
  
<a name="ignore_unview"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Ignore actions of out of sight monsters </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(ignore_unview)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option, you won't receive messages when out of sight 
  monsters fight one another. This is useful if you are playing with 
  lots of pets and don't wish to read a blow by blow account of the 
  battle raging around you.
  
<a name="display_race"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Player character depends on their race </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(display_race)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">With this option a player who plays as a Quylthulg, for example, will 
  be represented by a Q. If the option is turned off the player will 
  always be @. 
  
<a name="GamePlay"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Game Play Options
  
<a name="stack_force_notes"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Merge inscriptions when stacking </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(stack_force_notes)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty 
  inscription and the other does not. The resulting stack keeps the 
  non-empty inscription.
  
<a name="stack_force_costs"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Merge discounts when stacking </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(stack_force_costs)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have 
  different discounts. The resulting stack keeps the largest discount. 
  This option may cause you to lose "value", but will give you optimal 
  pack usage.
  
<a name="expand_list"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Expand the power of the list commands </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(expand_list)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Expand the "listing" commands so that they "wrap" at the "edges" of 
  the appropriate list. This allows the "look" and "target" commands to 
  "cycle" through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify 
  symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.
  
<a name="small_levels"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Allow unusually small dungeon levels </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(small_levels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option enables the creation of levels of varying sizes. Levels 
  that are as small as the town level (i.e. 1 'screen') are possible, 
  yet they can be dangerous, especially for a low level character. Note 
  that this option has the side effect of enabling / disabling 
  'destroyed' levels (they are enabled if small levels are).
  
<a name="always_small_levels"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Always create unusually small dungeon levels </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(always_small_levels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than 
  usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option above.
  
<a name="empty_levels"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Allow empty 'arena' levels </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(empty_levels)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Normal dungeon levels consist mostly of rock. If this option is in 
  use, levels which have empty floor instead of solid rock may also be 
  created (somewhat reminiscent of Nethack's "big-room" levels). These 
  levels can be extremely deadly, especially with breathing monsters 
  (since there are few obstructions to shield). Arena levels may have 
  vaults, nests and pits in them like normal levels. Some arena levels 
  are dark when they are created, but most are lit.
  
<a name="bound_walls_perm"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Boundary walls become 'permanent wall' </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(bound_walls_perm)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is set, boundaries of dungeon floors will explicitly 
  look like permanent walls. If unset, those will look like normal 
  walls, but still behave as permanent walls.
  
<a name="last_words"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Leave last words when your character dies </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(last_words)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Display a random line from the "death.txt" file when your character 
  dies and then allow you to rewrite these last words. If this option 
  is not selected, the "You die." message is displayed instead.
  
<a name="allow_debug_opts"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Allow use of debug/cheat options </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(allow_debug_opts)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Since use of debug command(^A), wizard mode(^W), and Cheating options 
  ('C' in options panel) mark the player as "Cheater" who can't 
  register their score, these debug/cheat options are forbidden by 
  default. The allow_debug_opts option removes these restrictions, and 
  allow the player to become "Cheater". But perhaps you just want to 
  test?
  
<a name="Disturbance"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Disturbance Options
  
<a name="find_ignore_stairs"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Run past stairs </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(find_ignore_stairs)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Ignore stairs when running.
  
<a name="find_ignore_doors"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Run through open doors </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(find_ignore_doors)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Ignore open doors when running.
  
<a name="find_cut"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Run past known corners </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(find_cut)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Cut sharply around known corners when running. This will result in 
  faster running, but may cause you to run into a lurking monster.
  
<a name="check_abort"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Check for user abort while continuous command </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(check_abort)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Turning this option off will avoid checking to see if the user has 
  pressed a key during resting or running or repeated commands. This 
  not only makes the game much more efficient (on many systems), but 
  also allows the use of certain obscure macro sequences, such as 
  turning this option off, resting until done, turning this option on, 
  and casting a spell. Resting for long periods of time with this 
  option turned off is dangerous since the resting may not stop until 
  the user takes damage from starvation.
  
<a name="flush_failure"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Flush input on various failures </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(flush_failure)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever 
  various "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to 
  use a wand, etc. This is very useful if you use macros which include 
  "directional" components with commands that can fail, since it will 
  prevent you from walking towards monsters when your spells fail.
  
<a name="flush_disturb"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Flush input whenever disturbed </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(flush_disturb)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the 
  character is "disturbed". This is useful if you use macros which take 
  time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while 
  being attacked by a monster.
  
<a name="disturb_move"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disturb whenever any monster moves </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(disturb_move)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears. 
  This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so 
  you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near 
  such monsters.
  
<a name="disturb_high"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disturb whenever high-level monster moves </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(disturb_high)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Disturb the player when any monster whose level is higher than the 
  player moves, appears, or disappears. This includes monsters which 
  are only visible due to telepathy.
  
<a name="disturb_near"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disturb whenever viewable monster moves </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(disturb_near)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any 
  monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any 
  viewable monster becomes no longer viewable. This option ignores the 
  existence of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether a 
  monster is "viewable". See also the "view_reduce_view" option.
  
<a name="disturb_pets"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disturb when visible pets move </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(disturb_pets)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not apply 
  to pets: for example, it can be annoying if your rest is always 
  disturbed by a pet dog who pops in every now and then. By default, 
  pets do not disturb you even if full monster disturbance options are 
  set. If you want your pets to disturb you like normal monsters, set 
  this option.
  
<a name="disturb_panel"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disturb whenever map panel changes </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(disturb_panel)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes you to be disturbed by the map scrolling, as it 
  does automatically when you get close to the edge of the screen.
  
<a name="disturb_state"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disturb whenever player state changes </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(disturb_state)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state 
  changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.
  
<a name="disturb_minor"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disturb whenever boring things happen </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(disturb_minor)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes you to be disturbed by various bring things, 
  including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and 
  beginning to run out of fuel.
  
<a name="ring_bell"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Audible bell (on errors, etc) </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(ring_bell)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Attempt to make a bell noise when various errors occur.
  
<a name="disturb_trap_detect"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Disturb when leaving trap detected area </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(disturb_trap_detect)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option causes you to be disturbed when the player is running out 
  of trap-detected area.
  
<a name="alert_trap_detect"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Alert when leaving trap detected area </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(alert_trap_detect)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option alerts you with message when the player is moving out of 
  the trap-detected area.
  
<a name="AutoDestroyer"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Easy Auto-Destroyer Options
  
<a name="destroy_items"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Use easy auto-destroyer </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(destroy_items)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option turns The Easy Destroyer on and off. If enabled, The Easy 
  Destroyer will destroy all objects unless the object is protected by 
  one or more of the leave_* options discussed below.
  
    </font><font color="#00ff00">Note: The </font><font color="#ff4040">Easy Auto-Destroyer </font><font color="#00ff00">is a simpler to use 
    version of the full featured </font><font color="#ff4040">Mogaminator </font><font color="#00ff00">discussed in <a href="editor.html">
    [h]</a>. It is designed for those who feel the full version 
    is too complicated to use. However, you really should 
    only use one or the other. So if you are using the full 
    version, then you should not also enable the easy 
    version.
  
<a name="destroy_feeling"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Apply auto-destroy on sensing an item </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(destroy_feeling)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy 
  Destroyer will take actions whenever the player senses the quality of 
  an object (i.e., whenever pseudo-id kicks in).
  
<a name="destroy_identify"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">Apply auto-destroy on identifying an item </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(destroy_identify)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy 
  Destroyer will take actions whenever the player identifies an object, 
  whether with a spell or with a magical device (but, alas, not via a 
  town service).
  
<a name="destroy_debug"></a>  </font><font color="#ffcc80">List the rule used when applying the Mogaminator </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(destroy_debug)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This is a debugging option when using the full-featured Mogaminator. 
  Enabling this option results in the reporting of the rule used 
  whenever an action is taken, such as pickup, auto-identify or 
  destroy. The rule in question will appear in the message line. For 
  example:
    You have 26 charges remaining. </font><font color="#00c8ff">(AutoID:</font><font color="#ffffff">~?</font><font color="#00ff00">unidentified </font><font color="#ff4040">rods</font><font color="#00c8ff">) </font><font color="#ffffff">You see </font><font color="#a500ff">a

  </font><font color="#ffffff">This option protects specific items which are normally worthless, but very im 
  
<a name="BaseDelay"></a>  </font><font color="#c00000">Base Delay Factor
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The </font><font color="#ff4040">delay_factor </font><font color="#ffffff">value, if non-zero, is used to slow down the game, 
  which is useful to allow you to observe the animations of bolt, beam, 
  and ball attacks. The actual delay is equal to delay_factor cubed, in 
  milliseconds.
  
<a name="Hitpoint"></a>  </font><font color="#c00000">Hitpoint Warning
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The </font><font color="#ff4040">hitpoint_warn </font><font color="#ffffff">value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal 
  hitpoints at which the player is warned that he may die. It is also 
  used as the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.
  
<a name="Autosave"></a>  </font><font color="#c00000">Autosave Options
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not 
  needed at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which 
  it, to be frank, probably is not), the user might forget to save and 
  his hardware could fail him. For all of these reasons, you may want 
  to use these options:
    
<a name="autosave_l"></a>    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Autosave when entering new levels </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(autosave_l)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your 
    character every time before creating a new dungeon level.
    
<a name="autosave_t"></a>    </font><font color="#ffcc80">Timed autosave </font><font color="#8a8a8a">(autosave_t)
    </font><font color="#ffffff">If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your 
    character every n game turns, where n is the "frequency". To set 
    the frequency press </font><font color="#ff9200">F</font><font color="#ffffff">. It will increase the frequency to the next 
    category (and from 25000 to 0), the categories being every 50, 100, 
    250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 and 25000 turns. Note that the 
    frequency must be higher than 0 and the "Timed autosave" set to 
    "yes" for timed autosaves to take place.
    
<a name="Window"></a>  </font><font color="#c00000">Window Flags
  
  </font><font color="#ffffff">These options select what kind of information is displayed in which 
  window. Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which 
  can be used to display useful information generally available through 
  other means. The best thing about these windows is that they are 
  updated automatically (usually) to reflect the current state of the 
  world. The "window options" can be used to specify what should be
