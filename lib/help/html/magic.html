<font color="#00ffff">The Magic System

</font><font color="#ffffff">Just beneath the surface of the commonplace and mundane lurks the 
unpredictable and magical. Some may access these forces, gaining great 
powers in the process. Others eschew the unexplained and unexplainable. 
Whether you use magic is up to you, and depends upon which class you 
choose to play. Hack and slash with the warrior, and magic will forever 
remain a mystery to you; choose the life of a Mage, and the eternal 
secrets of the universe may be revealed to you.

Magic is available in many forms. Magical potions can be used by any 
characters, even the illiterate and uncivilized Berserkers. Magical 
scrolls, wands, rods and staves are available to all classes except 
Berserker, but require some skill to use correctly; these forms of 
magic are discussed elsewhere and not covered here in detail. Finally, 
there are the select few who access the forces of magic directly, 
casting spells to slay and spells to heal; spells to learn and spells 
to travel; spells to beguile and spells to banish; it is here, into the 
realm of the spellcaster, that we now shall journey.

<a name="Types"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Spellcaster Types

</font><font color="#ffffff">There are two main kinds of spellcaster: those who use ancient books of 
erudition to access the magical, and those who gain powers or abilities 
directly through their mental focus. In addition, there are </font><font color="#ff0000">special 
techniques</font><font color="#ffffff">, which may not be traditional magic but obey most of the 
same rules as magic does; these may effectively fall into either of the 
first two categories. </font><font color="#ff0000">Racial powers </font><font color="#ffffff">and other similar abilities are 
granted by race, class or mutations rather than magical ability, and 
work in somewhat different ways.

</font><font color="#ff0000">Book spellcasters </font><font color="#ffffff">are the traditional magic-user classes; they must 
find (or purchase) appropriate spellbooks to learn from, and read from 
those books as they cast spells, requiring clear eyes and light to see 
with. </font><font color="#ff0000">Non-book spellcasters </font><font color="#ffffff">gain their powers automatically as they 
grow in experience and understanding, and can sometimes invoke their 
magic in the dark or while blind. A small number of classes, including 
Force-Trainers and Ninja-Lawyers, can use both book and non-book magic.

All spellcasters require a clear, unconfused mind, as well as a 
functional </font><font color="#ff8000">m </font><font color="#ffffff">key, to access the magical. Nearly all spellcasters also 
need </font><font color="#ff0000">spell points </font><font color="#ffffff">(SP, mana) to cast spells; mana measures the 
spellcaster's concentration and magical energy, and without it spells 
will fail. Some casters may be able to substitute hit points for mana 
(this is more commonly the case for racial powers than normal magic); 
and some spells may come to the caster so easily they require no mana 
at all. All spellcasters have a </font><font color="#ff0000">primary stat </font><font color="#ffffff">or </font><font color="#ff0000">spellcasting stat</font><font color="#ffffff">; 
their ability to cast spells, as well as the size of their mana pool, 
depends on this stat. </font><font color="#ff0000">Anti-magic </font><font color="#ffffff">always prevents magic of this type, 
though it may not affect some special techniques that are otherwise 
indistinguishable from magic.

Racial powers (and other similar powers) are used with the </font><font color="#ff8000">U </font><font color="#ffffff">key (</font><font color="#ff8000">O </font><font color="#ffffff">in 
the roguelike keyset). Racial powers also require mana, but not 
absolutely; it is common to substitute HP. Racial powers, like spells, 
depend on a spellcasting stat; but while all spells rely on the same 
casting stat, each racial power has its own stat. Racial powers are not 
affected by anti-magic.

The bulk of this document is about book spellcasting, and the various 
magic realms available to book casters.

<a name="Spellbook"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Spellbook Magic

</font><font color="#ffffff">All spellbooks belong to one of the many </font><font color="#ff0000">magic realms </font><font color="#ffffff">in the game. Most 
book spellcasters are limited to one or two realms, chosen from a wider 
list of options during character creation; which realms are open for 
selection depends on your class. Each realm contains exactly four 
books, and each book contains eight spells, though some of these spells 
may be unavailable to you even if you specialize in the right realm. A 
few classes, such as Sorcerers, follow special rules and are not 
limited to two realms.

Classes with two realms have a </font><font color="#ff0000">primary realm </font><font color="#ffffff">and a </font><font color="#ff0000">secondary realm</font><font color="#ffffff">. The 
primary realm is the one you are truly proficient in; your fail rates 
are higher in the secondary realm, and you will never be able to fully 
master its spells. The secondary realm does have one advantage: unlike 
the primary realm, it can be changed during the game. To achieve this, 
simply </font><font color="#ff8000">G</font><font color="#ffffff">ain a spell from a book of the realm you wish to switch to. 
However, you will forget any spells you learned in the old realm, and 
the number of total spells you can learn during the game is limited; so 
use this power wisely and sparingly.

Most realms have two cheap </font><font color="#ff0000">town books </font><font color="#ffffff">that can be regularly found in 
shops, and two rare and valuable </font><font color="#ff0000">dungeon books </font><font color="#ffffff">that cannot be acquired 
so easily. It is rumoured that the witches of Witch Wood have a nice 
collection of dungeon books...

<a name="Proficiency"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Spell Proficiency

</font><font color="#ffffff">The more experience you have with a particular book spell, the lower 
your fail rates and mana cost for that spell. This is called </font><font color="#ff0000">spell 
proficiency</font><font color="#ffffff">, and is indicated by the rough labels </font><font color="#00ff00">Unskilled</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#00ff00">Beginner</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
</font><font color="#00ff00">Skilled</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#00ff00">Expert </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#00ff00">Master</font><font color="#ffffff">. Every time you use a spell, you gain some 
proficiency with that spell, although serious experience can only be 
gained deep in the dungeon; casting a spell over and over again in the 
safety of a town will not help you much.

Most (though not all) classes also have an alternative way to gain 
proficiency: by studying the same spell a second (or third) time with 
the </font><font color="#ff8000">G </font><font color="#ffffff">command. This will take you (at a minimum) to the next labeled 
level of proficiency, and retain some of whatever progress you had 
already made towards the next level; but it also consumes one of your 
allocated opportunities to learn a spell, and means another spell might 
remain unstudied forever unless you find a Scroll of Spell.

In general, all players start with Unskilled proficiency with every 
spell, can Master all spells in their first realm, and can reach Expert 
level in all spells in their second realm if they have one. </font><font color="#ff0000">Sorcerers 
</font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#ff0000">Red-Mages</font><font color="#ffffff">, who are not limited to two realms, follow special rules 
regarding proficiency; Sorcerers automatically Master all spells they 
have access to, while Red-Mages are Skilled in all of their spells. The 
proficiency of </font><font color="#ff0000">Skillmasters </font><font color="#ffffff">is also special, and determined solely by 
how many skill points they have invested in the realm. These three 
classes gain no proficiency from using a spell.

<a name="Book"></a></font><font color="#c00000">What a Spellbook Looks Like

</font><font color="#ffffff">This is what a young character might see on pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">m </font><font color="#ffffff">and selecting a 
spellbook:

</font><font color="#ffffff">Indicated for each spell are the spell's label (the key for that 
spell), the spell's name, your proficiency, the character level at 
which the spell can first be learned, mana cost, fail rate and some 
additional information. The spell </font><font color="#00ff00">Flash of Light </font><font color="#ffffff">is shown in </font><font color="#00ff00">green 
</font><font color="#ffffff">because the character has studied it but not yet attempted to cast it; 
Magic Missile and Touch of Confusion are shown in white because they 
have been both studied and successfully cast, while the other spells 
are all </font><font color="#00ffff">light blue </font><font color="#ffffff">to indicate they have not been studied yet. Magic 
Missile is already up to [Be]ginner proficiency, while the other seven 
spells are still [Un]skilled.

The very brief additional info does not tell us much; Magic Missile 
does 3d4 damage, and is presumably a magical missile, but the other 
spells are not as self-explanatory. Instead of </font><font color="#ff8000">m</font><font color="#ffffff">, we can use the </font><font color="#ff8000">b

  </font><font color="#ffff00">Lights up nearby area and the inside of a room permanently.

</font><font color="#ffffff">Here I'm looking into the Flash of Light spell; the description makes 
it clear this is an illumination spell and not, say, a bolt of light.

<a name="WhichSpell"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Which Spells Should I Study?

</font><font color="#ffffff">A few spellcasting classes, generally those associated with Wisdom or 
priesthood, have no direct control over which spells they gain; when 
they use the </font><font color="#ff8000">G </font><font color="#ffffff">Gain a Spell command, their gods select a new spell for 
them at random. Most classes, though, can choose a specific spell to 
study; as noted above, they can even study the same spell repeatedly!

As a rule, you can </font><font color="#ff0000">eventually </font><font color="#ffffff">learn all spells in your realm or realms; 
the exceptions are if you swapped your secondary realm mid-game or if 
you studied a single spell more than once, and even then you can gain 
new spell slots with Scrolls of Spell. So the question is not so much 
"which spells should I study?" - you will study all or nearly all of 
them - as it is </font><font color="#ffff00">which spell you should study right now</font><font color="#ffffff">.

Book spellcasters often have a hard time killing monsters in the early 
game, so it helps if your first spell is something </font><font color="#ff0000">offensive </font><font color="#ffffff">like Magic 
Missile. You can get a mage off the ground without offensive spells, 
but it takes care and patience! Once you have solid offensive options, 
utility spells like detection, escapes and buffs become more inviting.

<a name="MagicRealms"></a></font><font color="#c00000">General Magic Realms

</font><font color="#ffffff">These magic realms are available as first and second realms to a wide 
variety of classes, though not necessarily to all book spellcasters.

<a name="Life"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Life
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Life magic is very good for healing; it relies mostly on healing, 
  protection and detection spells. This realm has no direct damage 
  spells, at least against the living. It said that some high level 
  spell of life magic can disintegrate Undead monsters into ash. Life 
  is considered a "good" realm; if virtues are on, the fail rate of 
  Life spells goes up if the caster's alignment tends towards evil, and 
  down if the caster is aligned with the forces of good.

<a name="Sorcery"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Sorcery
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Sorcery is a utility realm, including enchantment and general spells. 
  It provides superb utility spells (such as Teleport spells for 
  fleeing and even Globe of Invulnerability), spells to enhance your 
  odds in combat (Slow Monster, Haste Self, Confuse Monster) and, most 
  importantly, a vast selection of spells for gathering information: in 
  addition to the usual detection and identify spells, one of the 
  standard spellbooks has a spell called Identify True, which gives you 
  full knowledge of a given object! In the rare books, there are spells 
  with which you can protect your inventory items or even turn unwanted 
  items to gold. However, Sorcery has one weakness: it has no spells to 
  deal direct damage to your enemies.

<a name="Nature"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Nature
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Nature magic makes you a master of the elements; it provides 
  protection, detection, curing and attack spells, and most 
  importantly, spells that change surrounding geographical features. 
  Nature also offers Herbal Healing, which is the only powerful healing 
  spell outside the realm of Life magic. Since Nature seeks balance and 
  harmony, fail rates of Nature spells go up when the caster's 
  alignment becomes very good or evil.

<a name="Chaos"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Chaos
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Chaos is the very element of unmaking, and Chaos spells are the most 
  terrible weapons of destruction imaginable. From Magic Missile and 
  Fire Bolt to the medium level Fire Ball and Doom Bolt, and finally to 
  the awesome spells of Invoke Logrus, Mana Storm and Call the Void, 
  Chaos offers an almost unsurpassable arsenal of attack spells. Chaos 
  is one of two realms to provide the Destruction spell. The caster can 
  also call on the primal forces of Chaos to induce mutations in 
  enemies and even themselves; but apart from this, Chaos has no 
  protective spells. Beware! Chaos spells are known to backfire easily 
  and produce undesired effects.

<a name="Death"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Death
  </font><font color="#ffffff">There is no fouler nor more evil category of spells than the 
  necromantic spells of Death Magic. These spells are relatively hard 
  to learn, but at higher levels the spells give the caster power over 
  living and the (un)dead. Poison, vampirism, death spells, and even 
  the forces of nether can be directed by the caster. Should a Death 
  wizard find the legendary tome Necronomicon, he can expect to gain 
  very great powers indeed, but at a cost: few that have studied that 
  accursed tome have retained their sanity. Since this is an evil 
  realm, the fail rates of Death spells go up for good-aligned casters 
  if virtues are turned on.

<a name="Trump"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Trump
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Trump magic seems an independent source of power, even if supposedly 
  associated with Chaos. Although it lacks the unpredictable chaotic 
  side-effects of Chaos magic, it has a few spells whose exact effects 
  seem more or less random. One such spell is Shuffle: the Trump 
  spellbooks actually consist of decks of trumps, and the Shuffle spell 
  allows the caster to shuffle the deck and pick one card at random. 
  The effect depends on the card picked, and is not always pleasant. 
  The Trump gateways are a major method of transportation, and the 
  realm has an admirable selection of teleportation spells. Trump magic 
  has no equal when it comes to summoning creatures; but not all 
  monsters appreciate being drawn to another place by the Trump user. 
  The only summoned creatures whose loyalty is fully guaranteed are the 
  Phantasmal Servants, who lack a will of their own... but might 
  develop one if you treat them badly.

<a name="Arcane"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Arcane
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Arcane, even more than Sorcery, is a general-purpose realm; it 
  attempts to offer all the utility spells of other realms, as well as 
  a few of its own. The downside of Arcane is that it is somewhat 
  lacking in really powerful spells, and many of its spells are more 
  expensive than their cousins in other realms. Arcane is the only 
  realm with no dungeon spellbooks; all four Arcane books can be bought 
  in town. Arcane offers good support to other realms, but characters 
  with just one realm may find it too limited.

<a name="Craft"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Craft
  </font><font color="#ffffff">As the realm of enchantment, Craft magic offers spells to enhance the 
  player and his equipment, and even to forge new powerful magical 
  objects. Player enhancements include extra resistance, speed, armor 
  and combat skills. Item enhancements include magical bonuses and 
  temporary elemental slays, which can be quite powerful when applied 
  to the right sort of weapon. Finally, forging or crafting turns an 
  existing object into a random ego item and is quite unique to this 
  magic realm. It is even said that Craft magic allows the caster to 
  enhance their offensive damage, using their own mana to power mighty 
  slays that none may resist. But this may just be a rumor...

<a name="Daemon"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Daemon
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Daemon magic offers powerful attack spells with the properties of 
  Fire or Nether. There are a few detection spells which provide a map 
  of the nearby area or temporary telepathy. Daemon magic also provides 
  temporary transformation spells which allow caster to become a Demon 
  or even a mighty Demon Lord. Daemon is an evil realm; if virtues are 
  on, the fail rates of Daemon spells go up for casters aligned towards 
  good.

<a name="Crusade"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Crusade
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Crusade is the ultimate "good" realm; it has some attack spells, but 
  they are mostly used for harming and banishing foul minions of evil, 
  and are not very effective against a good monster. If virtues are on, 
  the fail rates of Crusade spells go up for casters aligned with evil.

<a name="Armageddon"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Armageddon
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Death. Destruction. Slaughter. This realm knows nothing else and 
  every spell is a direct offensive spell. From elemental attacks to 
  mighty breath attacks, Armageddon is unparalleled in raw damage. It 
  might be better to seek a more balanced approach, and even Chaos 
  magic offers some utility spells to complement the offense; still, if 
  you want the ultimate in destruction, look no further.

<a name="OtherMagicRealms"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Class-Specific Magic Realms

</font><font color="#ffffff">In addition to the realms listed above, there are a few class-specific 
spell realms. These realms also use books to gain access to magic but 
might behave slightly differently than normal spellbook realms.

<a name="Law"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Law
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The realm of Law is the speciality of Lawyers. It straddles the line 
  between general and class-specific magic - it can be studied by 
  non-specialists, but no other class can master it as easily or 
  completely as the Lawyer. The Law realm offers a fairly comprehensive 
  set of utility tricks, allowing its practitioner to detect threats 
  and opportunities, mystify enemies, set traps, charm potential 
  friends and weasel out of dangerous situations; but it offers few 
  direct offensive options.

<a name="Music"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Music
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Unique to Bards, this realm grants power through song. As such, only 
  a single spell may be sung at a time, and the effects of the various 
  spells endure (and perhaps grow stronger) so long as the song is 
  continued. Reading a scroll, or quaffing a potion, interrupts the 
  current song, discontinuing its effects. Certain harps may enhance 
  this form of magic.

<a name="Hex"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Hex
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Unique to the High-Mage, Hex magic thrives on curses; truly, the four 
  Hex spellbooks are full of language not fit for printing. Most Hex 
  spells are cast continually, like the musical songs of the bard; but 
  they are chanted rather than sung, and multiple chants may be woven 
  at once, inter-weaving verse upon verse, and hex upon hex, allowing 
  the caster to get more than one effect going at a time. However, the 
  number of concurrent spells is strictly limited, increasing only 
  slowly with level. While reading a scroll interrupts all of Hex 
  casters' foul chants, I've heard tell of Hex mages inhaling potions 
  through their nose without the least pause in the spell; but I find 
  this rather hard to believe, and quite silly besides.

<a name="Burglary"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Burglary
  </font><font color="#ffffff">This is the preferred realm of the Rogue, and unique to that class. 
  Strong in detection and general sneakiness, this realm also offers 
  the ability to set traps, to pick pockets, to negotiate with thieves, 
  and to assassinate sleeping foes. Unlike normal detection, whose 
  range is fixed, burglary spells increase the area of effect with the 
  level of the caster, ultimately applying to the entire level of the 
  current dungeon. The true burglar has a good eye for danger and may 
  map out their escape route in advance. They can make haste to escape 
  a tricky situation. They may examine the proceeds of their thievery 
  (their loot) and consequently have a very good idea of the quality of 
  the treasures they... ahem... find. Burglary rogues are well known to 
  the Black Markets of the world, and treated well as the principal 
  source of new inventory; but that is hardly a magical fact, or is it?

<a name="Necromancy"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Necromancy
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Exclusive to the Necromancer, this is the foul realm of undeath 
  allowing the caster to communicate with, and ultimately control, the 
  deceased. And the dead have lots to offer, including knowledge of 
  this world and the objects it contains. As servants, they are hard to 
  kill, being dead already! In addition, this realm offers something 
  quite unique: the ability to touch foes with deadly (undeadly) 
  powers. At first, the touch of the necromancer is weak, being cold, 
  or dark, or poisonous, but eventually the touch grows stronger, 
  stealing life little by little, and perhaps, maybe, eventually all at 
  once. But who knows for certain, as those that did learn the foul 
  necromantic secrets are with us no more?

<a name="Rage"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Rage
  </font><font color="#ffffff">A special technique rather than magic, this realm is unique to the 
  Rage-Mages, sworn enemies of all things magical. Talents are learned 
  from books, to be sure, but the ritual of gaining spells involves the 
  destruction of the book in the process, meaning the Rage-Mage can 
  only learn one spell from each book they find. And once learned, the 
  book is no longer required to cast the technique, which is perhaps 
  fortunate. This realm offers various combat techniques, as well as 
  the talent to simply shout down magical enemies.

<a name="Kendo"></a></font><font color="#00ff00">Kendo
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Another technique realm, Kendo is unique to the Samurai, offering 
  powerful talents to directly enhance the effectiveness of melee. 
  Talents are learned from books, but, once learned, may be freely used 
  without further reference to the book.

<a name="CastingSpells"></a></font><font color="#c00000">On Casting Spells

</font><font color="#ffffff">Players who select spellcasting characters may notice a few unusual 
phenomena during the course of the game. Here are a few tips and hints 
on what may be happening.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Armor and Spell Casting
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Most spellcasting classes are penalized for wielding armor and 
  weapons above a certain total combined weight, though the size of the 
  penalty, the maximum weight allowed and the extent to which weapons 
  count towards that maximum vary widely from class to class. Exceeding 
  the weight limit reduces your maximum SP; you are warned when this 
  happens.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Glove Encumbrance
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Many spellcasters, in particular mages, need their fingers free for 
  the intricate gestures that accompany a spell and are therefore 
  heavily penalized for wearing gloves on their hands. Items that grant 
  Free Action, Dexterity or Magic Device Skill are an exception to this 
  and can be worn normally; and not all magical or book-using classes 
  are limited in this way.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Spell Durations
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Some spells such as Haste-Self or Resistance grant an effect which 
  wears off after a certain period of time. With very few exceptions, 
  multiple castings of such spells are not cumulative in terms of the 
  duration of the spell; in other words, casting a spell which has a 
  duration of 20 turns three times will not result in a duration of 60 
  turns. Typically, subsequent castings will add only a small amount to 
  the total duration.

<a name="SpellTypes"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Spell Types

</font><font color="#00ff00">Bolts and Beams
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Bolt and beam spells are aimed in a direction or at a target. A bolt 
  spell will hit the first monster or obstruction in its targeted 
  direction, which may or may not have been the intended target. A beam 
  spell, on the other hand, will hit every target within range in the 
  direction of fire until it hits a wall or other obstacle. Monsters 
  with Reflection have a 75% chance to reflect bolts, but beams are not 
  affected. Beams, unlike bolts, can damage objects. Many bolt spells 
  have a random chance to generate beams.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Balls
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Ball spells differ from bolts in several ways: they always hit the 
  intended target (if it was a valid target in line of sight); they 
  have a radius (which varies from spell to spell); and they cannot be 
  reflected. A radius value of one or more will result in the spell 
  affecting the area around the target square in addition to the target 
  itself; this can affect additional monsters, objects or terrain, 
  though only the target square suffers full damage. When ball spells 
  are directed at monsters in walls, the ball will blow up in front of 
  the wall, reducing the damage taken by the monster to half since it 
  is not at the epicenter. Almost all ball spells can be aimed, though 
  a few are always centered on the player (the player does not take any 
  damage in this case).

</font><font color="#00ff00">Line-of-Sight
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Line-of-sight spells affect all monsters that that are currently in 
  your character's line of sight, including invisible and otherwise 
  unseen monsters. Line-of-sight spells cannot, and need not, be aimed.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Area
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Area spells affect an area around the player. The size of the area 
  can vary considerably; for example, Light Area illuminates a single 
  room, while Detect Traps and Mass Genocide affect all squares within 
  a specific radius (regardless of line of sight), and normal Genocide 
  affects the entire level. Area spells cannot be aimed.

</font><font color="#00ff00">Other
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Many spells, like Identify or Teleport Self, are not directed outside 
  and affect the player or objects carried by the player. Buff spells 
  provide temporary benefits such as haste or elemental resistance, and 
  almost always have a duration. Healing spells cure status effects and 
  give back lost hit points. Play the game and find out what else there 
  is!

<a name="Macros"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Using Macros to Cast Spells

</font><font color="#00ff00">Macros </font><font color="#ffffff">and </font><font color="#00ff00">keymaps </font><font color="#ffffff">are a somewhat advanced topic; it is by no means 
necessary to ever use a macro during a game, so you can skip this 
section if you wish. The basics behind macros, though, are not that 
hard to grasp.

Casting a book spell requires a minimum of three keypresses - one to 
select the spell command, one to select the right book and one to 
select the right spell. Three keypresses is not that much, but over the 
course of a long game you might cast some spells 1000 times or even 
more, so it adds up! This is the main reason single-key macros or 
keymaps for common spells are often convenient.

Going back to our earlier example book:

(Spells a-h, *=List, ESC=exit) Cast which spell?                                
     Name                    Profic Lvl  SP Fail Desc
  a) Magic Missile             [Be]   1   2   5% dam 3d4
  </font><font color="#00ffff">b) Trap / Door Destruction   [Un]   1   4   9% unknown
  </font><font color="#00ff00">c) Flash of Light            [Un]   2   4  15% untried
  </font><font color="#ffffff">d) Touch of Confusion        [Un]   5   8  49%
  </font><font color="#00ffff">e) Mana Burst                [Un]   9  10  91% unknown
  f) Fire Bolt                 [Un]  13  15  95% unknown
  g) Fist of Force             [Un]  14  15  95% unknown
  h) Teleport Self             [Un]  15  15  95% unknown

</font><font color="#ffffff">Suppose this is book </font><font color="#ff0000">a</font><font color="#ffffff">, and furthermore that I have inscribed the book 
as </font><font color="#ff0000">@ma </font><font color="#ffffff">to make sure it will always be book </font><font color="#ff0000">a </font><font color="#ffffff">and not suddenly change 
slots (see <a href="objects.html#Inscriptions"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">for more details on inscriptions). This means I'll be 
typing </font><font color="#ff8000">mac </font><font color="#ffffff">to cast the Flash of Light illumination spell, something I 
will likely do several hundred times in a game if I don't die early.

Using the </font><font color="#ff8000">@ </font><font color="#ffffff">command, I can create a new macro with the </font><font color="#ff8000">F6 </font><font color="#ffffff">key as the 
trigger and </font><font color="#ff8000">mac </font><font color="#ffffff">as the action. (Keymaps are generally preferable to 
macros; but the F6 key is only acceptable as a macro trigger, not a 
keymap trigger, so if that's what I wish to use it has to be a macro.)
I can now use the F6 key to illuminate rooms with a single keypress... 
and the next time I play a different character with a different 
illumination spell, I can map </font><font color="#ff8000">F6 </font><font color="#ffffff">to the new spell and keep using the 
same key instead of having to memorize a new sequence.

    </font><font color="#00ff00">Always append your macros and keymaps to a file. 
    Otherwise, they will be lost when you exit the game.

</font><font color="#ffffff">Now suppose I want to have a macro for Magic Missile as well. I could 
simply map </font><font color="#ff8000">F1 </font><font color="#ffffff">to the sequence </font><font color="#ff8000">maa </font><font color="#ffffff">(indeed, this is what I personally 
would do); but some players like to go further and map it to </font><font color="#ff8000">maa*5</font><font color="#ffffff">, so 
the macro automatically selects a target as well. This has the downside 
that you might not get the target you would like best; but if you are 
just spamming magic missiles into a crowd of weak enemies, that will 
probably not matter so much.

Note that an </font><font color="#ff8000">maa*5 </font><font color="#ffffff">macro only saves two keypresses per enemy over an 
</font><font color="#ff8000">maa </font><font color="#ffffff">macro, even if the spell is used more than once; and the </font><font color="#ff8000">maa </font><font color="#ffffff">macro 
itself only saves two keypresses per enemy compared to just pressing 
every key in the sequence m-a-a-*-5. This is because after the first 
cast, the single-key </font><font color="#ff8000">n </font><font color="#ffffff">command (</font><font color="#ff8000">X </font><font color="#ffffff">in the roguelike keyset) can be used 
to repeat both the spell and the targetting.
