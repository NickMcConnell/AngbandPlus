<style:title>The Magic System</style>

Just beneath the surface of the commonplace and mundane lurks the unpredictable and magical. Some may access these forces, gaining great powers in the process. Others eschew the unexplained and unexplainable. Whether you use magic is up to you, and depends upon which class you choose to play. Hack and slash with the warrior, and magic will forever remain a mystery to you; choose the life of a Mage, and the eternal secrets of the universe may be revealed to you.

Magic is available in many forms. Magical potions can be used by any characters, even the illiterate and uncivilized Berserkers. Magical scrolls, wands, rods and staves are available to all classes except Berserker, but require some skill to use correctly; these forms of magic are discussed elsewhere and not covered here in detail. Finally, there are the select few who access the forces of magic directly, casting spells to slay and spells to heal; spells to learn and spells to travel; spells to beguile and spells to banish; it is here, into the realm of the spellcaster, that we now shall journey.

<topic:Types><style:heading>Spellcaster Types</style>

There are two main kinds of spellcaster: those who use ancient books of erudition to access the magical, and those who gain powers or abilities directly through their mental focus. In addition, there are <color:keyword>special techniques</color>, which may not be traditional magic but obey most of the same rules as magic does; these may effectively fall into either of the first two categories. <color:keyword>Racial powers</color> and other similar abilities are granted by race, class or mutations rather than magical ability, and work in somewhat different ways.

<color:keyword>Book spellcasters</color> are the traditional magic-user classes; they must find (or purchase) appropriate spellbooks to learn from, and read from those books as they cast spells, requiring clear eyes and light to see with. <color:keyword>Non-book spellcasters</color> gain their powers automatically as they grow in experience and understanding, and can sometimes invoke their magic in the dark or while blind. A small number of classes, including Force-Trainers and Ninja-Lawyers, can use both book and non-book magic.

All spellcasters require a clear, unconfused mind, as well as a functional <color:keypress>m</color> key, to access the magical. Nearly all spellcasters also need <color:keyword>spell points</color> (SP, mana) to cast spells; mana measures the spellcaster's concentration and magical energy, and without it spells will fail. Some casters may be able to substitute hit points for mana (this is more commonly the case for racial powers than normal magic); and some spells may come to the caster so easily they require no mana at all. All spellcasters have a <color:keyword>primary stat</color> or <color:keyword>spellcasting stat</color>; their ability to cast spells, as well as the size of their mana pool, depends on this stat. <color:keyword>Anti-magic</color> always prevents magic of this type, though it may not affect some special techniques that are otherwise indistinguishable from magic.

Racial powers (and other similar powers) are used with the <color:keypress>U</color> key (<color:keypress>O</color> in the roguelike keyset). Racial powers also require mana, but not absolutely; it is common to substitute HP. Racial powers, like spells, depend on a spellcasting stat; but while all spells rely on the same casting stat, each racial power has its own stat. Racial powers are not affected by anti-magic.

The bulk of this document is about book spellcasting, and the various magic realms available to book casters.

<topic:Spellbook><style:heading>Spellbook Magic</style>

All spellbooks belong to one of the many <color:keyword>magic realms</color> in the game. Most book spellcasters are limited to one or two realms, chosen from a wider list of options during character creation; which realms are open for selection depends on your class. Each realm contains exactly four books, and each book contains eight spells, though some of these spells may be unavailable to you even if you specialize in the right realm. A few classes, such as Sorcerers, follow special rules and are not limited to two realms.

Classes with two realms have a <color:keyword>primary realm</color> and a <color:keyword>secondary realm</color>. The primary realm is the one you are truly proficient in; your fail rates are higher in the secondary realm, and you will never be able to fully master its spells. The secondary realm does have one advantage: unlike the primary realm, it can be changed during the game. To achieve this, simply <color:keypress>G</color>ain a spell from a book of the realm you wish to switch to. However, you will forget any spells you learned in the old realm, and the number of total spells you can learn during the game is limited; so use this power wisely and sparingly.

Most realms have two cheap <color:keyword>town books</color> that can be regularly found in shops, and two rare and valuable <color:keyword>dungeon books</color> that cannot be acquired so easily. It is rumoured that the witches of Witch Wood have a nice collection of dungeon books...

<topic:Proficiency><style:heading>Spell Proficiency</style>

The more experience you have with a particular book spell, the lower your fail rates and mana cost for that spell. This is called <color:keyword>spell proficiency</color>, and is indicated by the rough labels <color:G>Unskilled</color>, <color:G>Beginner</color>, <color:G>Skilled</color>, <color:G>Expert</color> and <color:G>Master</color>. Every time you use a spell, you gain some proficiency with that spell, although serious experience can only be gained deep in the dungeon; casting a spell over and over again in the safety of a town will not help you much.

Most (though not all) classes also have an alternative way to gain proficiency: by studying the same spell a second (or third) time with the <color:keypress>G</color> command. This will take you (at a minimum) to the next labeled level of proficiency, and retain some of whatever progress you had already made towards the next level; but it also consumes one of your allocated opportunities to learn a spell, and means another spell might remain unstudied forever unless you find a Scroll of Spell.

In general, all players start with Unskilled proficiency with every spell, can Master all spells in their first realm, and can reach Expert level in all spells in their second realm if they have one. <color:keyword>Sorcerers</color> and <color:keyword>Red-Mages</color>, who are not limited to two realms, follow special rules regarding proficiency; Sorcerers automatically Master all spells they have access to, while Red-Mages are Skilled in all of their spells. The proficiency of <color:keyword>Skillmasters</color> is also special, and determined solely by how many skill points they have invested in the realm. These three classes gain no proficiency from using a spell.

<topic:Book><style:heading>What a Spellbook Looks Like</style>

This is what a young character might see on pressing <color:keypress>m</color> and selecting a spellbook:
<style:screenshot>
(Spells a-h, *=List, ESC=exit) Cast which spell?

<color:G>  c) Flash of Light            [Un]   2   4  15% untried</color>

<color:B>  h) Teleport Self             [Un]  15  15  95% unknown</color>
</style>
Indicated for each spell are the spell's label (the key for that spell), the spell's name, your proficiency, the character level at which the spell can first be learned, mana cost, fail rate and some additional information. The spell <color:G>Flash of Light</color> is shown in <color:G>green</color> because the character has studied it but not yet attempted to cast it; Magic Missile and Touch of Confusion are shown in white because they have been both studied and successfully cast, while the other spells are all <color:B>light blue</color> to indicate they have not been studied yet. Magic Missile is already up to [Be]ginner proficiency, while the other seven spells are still [Un]skilled.

The very brief additional info does not tell us much; Magic Missile does 3d4 damage, and is presumably a magical missile, but the other spells are not as self-explanatory. Instead of <color:keypress>m</color>, we can use the <color:keypress>b</color> Browse command (<color:keypress>P</color> for Peruse in the roguelike keyset) to learn more:
<style:screenshot>

  <color:y>Lights up nearby area and the inside of a room permanently.</color>
</style>
Here I'm looking into the Flash of Light spell; the description makes it clear this is an illumination spell and not, say, a bolt of light.

<topic:WhichSpell><style:heading>Which Spells Should I Study?</style>

A few spellcasting classes, generally those associated with Wisdom or priesthood, have no direct control over which spells they gain; when they use the <color:keypress>G</color> Gain a Spell command, their gods select a new spell for them at random. Most classes, though, can choose a specific spell to study; as noted above, they can even study the same spell repeatedly!

As a rule, you can <color:keyword>eventually</color> learn all spells in your realm or realms; the exceptions are if you swapped your secondary realm mid-game or if you studied a single spell more than once, and even then you can gain new spell slots with Scrolls of Spell. So the question is not so much "which spells should I study?" - you will study all or nearly all of them - as it is <color:y>which spell you should study right now</color>.

Book spellcasters often have a hard time killing monsters in the early game, so it helps if your first spell is something <color:keyword>offensive</color> like Magic Missile. You can get a mage off the ground without offensive spells, but it takes care and patience! Once you have solid offensive options, utility spells like detection, escapes and buffs become more inviting.

<topic:MagicRealms><style:heading>General Magic Realms</style>

These magic realms are available as first and second realms to a wide variety of classes, though not necessarily to all book spellcasters.

<topic:Life><color:G>Life</color>
  <indent>Life magic is very good for healing; it relies mostly on healing, protection and detection spells. This realm has no direct damage spells, at least against the living. It said that some high level spell of life magic can disintegrate Undead monsters into ash. Life is considered a "good" realm; if virtues are on, the fail rate of Life spells goes up if the caster's alignment tends towards evil, and down if the caster is aligned with the forces of good.</indent>

<topic:Sorcery><color:G>Sorcery</color>
  <indent>Sorcery is a utility realm, including enchantment and general spells. It provides superb utility spells (such as Teleport spells for fleeing and even Globe of Invulnerability), spells to enhance your odds in combat (Slow Monster, Haste Self, Confuse Monster) and, most importantly, a vast selection of spells for gathering information: in addition to the usual detection and identify spells, one of the standard spellbooks has a spell called Identify True, which gives you full knowledge of a given object! In the rare books, there are spells with which you can protect your inventory items or even turn unwanted items to gold. However, Sorcery has one weakness: it has no spells to deal direct damage to your enemies.</indent>

<topic:Nature><color:G>Nature</color>
  <indent>Nature magic makes you a master of the elements; it provides protection, detection, curing and attack spells, and most importantly, spells that change surrounding geographical features. Nature also offers Herbal Healing, which is the only powerful healing spell outside the realm of Life magic. Since Nature seeks balance and harmony, fail rates of Nature spells go up when the caster's alignment becomes very good or evil.</indent>

<topic:Chaos><color:G>Chaos</color>
  <indent>Chaos is the very element of unmaking, and Chaos spells are the most terrible weapons of destruction imaginable. From Magic Missile and Fire Bolt to the medium level Fire Ball and Doom Bolt, and finally to the awesome spells of Invoke Logrus, Mana Storm and Call the Void, Chaos offers an almost unsurpassable arsenal of attack spells. Chaos is one of two realms to provide the Destruction spell. The caster can also call on the primal forces of Chaos to induce mutations in enemies and even themselves; but apart from this, Chaos has no protective spells. Beware! Chaos spells are known to backfire easily and produce undesired effects.</indent>

<topic:Death><color:G>Death</color>
  <indent>There is no fouler nor more evil category of spells than the necromantic spells of Death Magic. These spells are relatively hard to learn, but at higher levels the spells give the caster power over living and the (un)dead. Poison, vampirism, death spells, and even the forces of nether can be directed by the caster. Should a Death wizard find the legendary tome Necronomicon, he can expect to gain very great powers indeed, but at a cost: few that have studied that accursed tome have retained their sanity. Since this is an evil realm, the fail rates of Death spells go up for good-aligned casters if virtues are turned on.</indent>

<topic:Trump><color:G>Trump</color>
  <indent>Trump magic seems an independent source of power, even if supposedly associated with Chaos. Although it lacks the unpredictable chaotic side-effects of Chaos magic, it has a few spells whose exact effects seem more or less random. One such spell is Shuffle: the Trump spellbooks actually consist of decks of trumps, and the Shuffle spell allows the caster to shuffle the deck and pick one card at random. The effect depends on the card picked, and is not always pleasant. The Trump gateways are a major method of transportation, and the realm has an admirable selection of teleportation spells. Trump magic has no equal when it comes to summoning creatures; but not all monsters appreciate being drawn to another place by the Trump user. The only summoned creatures whose loyalty is fully guaranteed are the Phantasmal Servants, who lack a will of their own... but might develop one if you treat them badly.</indent>

<topic:Arcane><color:G>Arcane</color>
  <indent>Arcane, even more than Sorcery, is a general-purpose realm; it attempts to offer all the utility spells of other realms, as well as a few of its own. The downside of Arcane is that it is somewhat lacking in really powerful spells, and many of its spells are more expensive than their cousins in other realms. Arcane is the only realm with no dungeon spellbooks; all four Arcane books can be bought in town. Arcane offers good support to other realms, but characters with just one realm may find it too limited.</indent>

<topic:Craft><color:G>Craft</color>
  <indent>As the realm of enchantment, Craft magic offers spells to enhance the player and his equipment, and even to forge new powerful magical objects. Player enhancements include extra resistance, speed, armor and combat skills. Item enhancements include magical bonuses and temporary elemental slays, which can be quite powerful when applied to the right sort of weapon. Finally, forging or crafting turns an existing object into a random ego item and is quite unique to this magic realm. It is even said that Craft magic allows the caster to enhance their offensive damage, using their own mana to power mighty slays that none may resist. But this may just be a rumor...</indent>

<topic:Daemon><color:G>Daemon</color>
  <indent>Daemon magic offers powerful attack spells with the properties of Fire or Nether. There are a few detection spells which provide a map of the nearby area or temporary telepathy. Daemon magic also provides temporary transformation spells which allow caster to become a Demon or even a mighty Demon Lord. Daemon is an evil realm; if virtues are on, the fail rates of Daemon spells go up for casters aligned towards good.</indent>

<topic:Crusade><color:G>Crusade</color>
  <indent>Crusade is the ultimate "good" realm; it has some attack spells, but they are mostly used for harming and banishing foul minions of evil, and are not very effective against a good monster. If virtues are on, the fail rates of Crusade spells go up for casters aligned with evil.</indent>

<topic:Armageddon><color:G>Armageddon</color>
  <indent>Death. Destruction. Slaughter. This realm knows nothing else and every spell is a direct offensive spell. From elemental attacks to mighty breath attacks, Armageddon is unparalleled in raw damage. It might be better to seek a more balanced approach, and even Chaos magic offers some utility spells to complement the offense; still, if you want the ultimate in destruction, look no further.</indent>

<topic:OtherMagicRealms><style:heading>Class-Specific Magic Realms</style>

In addition to the realms listed above, there are a few class-specific spell realms. These realms also use books to gain access to magic but might behave slightly differently than normal spellbook realms.

<topic:Law><color:G>Law</color>
  <indent>The realm of Law is the speciality of Lawyers. It straddles the line between general and class-specific magic - it can be studied by non-specialists, but no other class can master it as easily or completely as the Lawyer. The Law realm offers a fairly comprehensive set of utility tricks, allowing its practitioner to detect threats and opportunities, mystify enemies, set traps, charm potential friends and weasel out of dangerous situations; but it offers few direct offensive options.</indent>

<topic:Music><color:G>Music</color>
  <indent>Unique to Bards, this realm grants power through song. As such, only a single spell may be sung at a time, and the effects of the various spells endure (and perhaps grow stronger) so long as the song is continued. Reading a scroll, or quaffing a potion, interrupts the current song, discontinuing its effects. Certain harps may enhance this form of magic.</indent>

<topic:Hex><color:G>Hex</color>
  <indent>Unique to the High-Mage, Hex magic thrives on curses; truly, the four Hex spellbooks are full of language not fit for printing. Most Hex spells are cast continually, like the musical songs of the bard; but they are chanted rather than sung, and multiple chants may be woven at once, inter-weaving verse upon verse, and hex upon hex, allowing the caster to get more than one effect going at a time. However, the number of concurrent spells is strictly limited, increasing only slowly with level. While reading a scroll interrupts all of Hex casters' foul chants, I've heard tell of Hex mages inhaling potions through their nose without the least pause in the spell; but I find this rather hard to believe, and quite silly besides.</indent>

<topic:Burglary><color:G>Burglary</color>
  <indent>This is the preferred realm of the Rogue, and unique to that class. Strong in detection and general sneakiness, this realm also offers the ability to set traps, to pick pockets, to negotiate with thieves, and to assassinate sleeping foes. Unlike normal detection, whose range is fixed, burglary spells increase the area of effect with the level of the caster, ultimately applying to the entire level of the current dungeon. The true burglar has a good eye for danger and may map out their escape route in advance. They can make haste to escape a tricky situation. They may examine the proceeds of their thievery (their loot) and consequently have a very good idea of the quality of the treasures they... ahem... find. Burglary rogues are well known to the Black Markets of the world, and treated well as the principal source of new inventory; but that is hardly a magical fact, or is it?</indent>

<topic:Necromancy><color:G>Necromancy</color>
  <indent>Exclusive to the Necromancer, this is the foul realm of undeath allowing the caster to communicate with, and ultimately control, the deceased. And the dead have lots to offer, including knowledge of this world and the objects it contains. As servants, they are hard to kill, being dead already! In addition, this realm offers something quite unique: the ability to touch foes with deadly (undeadly) powers. At first, the touch of the necromancer is weak, being cold, or dark, or poisonous, but eventually the touch grows stronger, stealing life little by little, and perhaps, maybe, eventually all at once. But who knows for certain, as those that did learn the foul necromantic secrets are with us no more?</indent>

<topic:Rage><color:G>Rage</color>
  <indent>A special technique rather than magic, this realm is unique to the Rage-Mages, sworn enemies of all things magical. Talents are learned from books, to be sure, but the ritual of gaining spells involves the destruction of the book in the process, meaning the Rage-Mage can only learn one spell from each book they find. And once learned, the book is no longer required to cast the technique, which is perhaps fortunate. This realm offers various combat techniques, as well as the talent to simply shout down magical enemies.</indent>

<topic:Kendo><color:G>Kendo</color>
  <indent>Another technique realm, Kendo is unique to the Samurai, offering powerful talents to directly enhance the effectiveness of melee. Talents are learned from books, but, once learned, may be freely used without further reference to the book.</indent>

<topic:CastingSpells><style:heading>On Casting Spells</style>

Players who select spellcasting characters may notice a few unusual phenomena during the course of the game. Here are a few tips and hints on what may be happening.

<color:G>Armor and Spell Casting</color>
  <indent>Most spellcasting classes are penalized for wielding armor and weapons above a certain total combined weight, though the size of the penalty, the maximum weight allowed and the extent to which weapons count towards that maximum vary widely from class to class. Exceeding the weight limit reduces your maximum SP; you are warned when this happens.</indent>

<color:G>Glove Encumbrance</color>
  <indent>Many spellcasters, in particular mages, need their fingers free for the intricate gestures that accompany a spell and are therefore heavily penalized for wearing gloves on their hands. Items that grant Free Action, Dexterity or Magic Device Skill are an exception to this and can be worn normally; and not all magical or book-using classes are limited in this way.</indent>

<color:G>Spell Durations</color>
  <indent>Some spells such as Haste-Self or Resistance grant an effect which wears off after a certain period of time. With very few exceptions, multiple castings of such spells are not cumulative in terms of the duration of the spell; in other words, casting a spell which has a duration of 20 turns three times will not result in a duration of 60 turns. Typically, subsequent castings will add only a small amount to the total duration.</indent>

<topic:SpellTypes><style:heading>Spell Types</style>

<color:G>Bolts and Beams</color>
  <indent>Bolt and beam spells are aimed in a direction or at a target. A bolt spell will hit the first monster or obstruction in its targeted direction, which may or may not have been the intended target. A beam spell, on the other hand, will hit every target within range in the direction of fire until it hits a wall or other obstacle. Monsters with Reflection have a 75% chance to reflect bolts, but beams are not affected. Beams, unlike bolts, can damage objects. Many bolt spells have a random chance to generate beams.</indent>

<color:G>Balls</color>
  <indent>Ball spells differ from bolts in several ways: they always hit the intended target (if it was a valid target in line of sight); they have a radius (which varies from spell to spell); and they cannot be reflected. A radius value of one or more will result in the spell affecting the area around the target square in addition to the target itself; this can affect additional monsters, objects or terrain, though only the target square suffers full damage. When ball spells are directed at monsters in walls, the ball will blow up in front of the wall, reducing the damage taken by the monster to half since it is not at the epicenter. Almost all ball spells can be aimed, though a few are always centered on the player (the player does not take any damage in this case).</indent>

<color:G>Line-of-Sight</color>
  <indent>Line-of-sight spells affect all monsters that that are currently in your character's line of sight, including invisible and otherwise unseen monsters. Line-of-sight spells cannot, and need not, be aimed.</indent>

<color:G>Area</color>
  <indent>Area spells affect an area around the player. The size of the area can vary considerably; for example, Light Area illuminates a single room, while Detect Traps and Mass Genocide affect all squares within a specific radius (regardless of line of sight), and normal Genocide affects the entire level. Area spells cannot be aimed.</indent>

<color:G>Other</color>
  <indent>Many spells, like Identify or Teleport Self, are not directed outside and affect the player or objects carried by the player. Buff spells provide temporary benefits such as haste or elemental resistance, and almost always have a duration. Healing spells cure status effects and give back lost hit points. Play the game and find out what else there is!</indent>

<topic:Macros><style:heading>Using Macros to Cast Spells</style>

<color:G>Macros</color> and <color:G>keymaps</color> are a somewhat advanced topic; it is by no means necessary to ever use a macro during a game, so you can skip this section if you wish. The basics behind macros, though, are not that hard to grasp.

Casting a book spell requires a minimum of three keypresses - one to select the spell command, one to select the right book and one to select the right spell. Three keypresses is not that much, but over the course of a long game you might cast some spells 1000 times or even more, so it adds up! This is the main reason single-key macros or keymaps for common spells are often convenient.

Going back to our earlier example book:
<style:screenshot>
(Spells a-h, *=List, ESC=exit) Cast which spell?                                
     Name                    Profic Lvl  SP Fail Desc

<color:B>  h) Teleport Self             [Un]  15  15  95% unknown</color>
</style>
Suppose this is book <color:R>a</color>, and furthermore that I have inscribed the book as <color:R>@ma</color> to make sure it will always be book <color:R>a</color> and not suddenly change slots (see <link:objects.txt#Inscriptions> for more details on inscriptions). This means I'll be typing <color:keypress>mac</color> to cast the Flash of Light illumination spell, something I will likely do several hundred times in a game if I don't die early.

Using the <color:keypress>@</color> command, I can create a new macro with the <color:keypress>F6</color> key as the trigger and <color:keypress>mac</color> as the action. (Keymaps are generally preferable to macros; but the F6 key is only acceptable as a macro trigger, not a keymap trigger, so if that's what I wish to use it has to be a macro.)
I can now use the F6 key to illuminate rooms with a single keypress... and the next time I play a different character with a different illumination spell, I can map <color:keypress>F6</color> to the new spell and keep using the same key instead of having to memorize a new sequence.

<style:note>Always append your macros and keymaps to a file. Otherwise, they will be lost when you exit the game.</color>

Now suppose I want to have a macro for Magic Missile as well. I could simply map <color:keypress>F1</color> to the sequence <color:keypress>maa</color> (indeed, this is what I personally would do); but some players like to go further and map it to <color:keypress>maa*5</color>, so the macro automatically selects a target as well. This has the downside that you might not get the target you would like best; but if you are just spamming magic missiles into a crowd of weak enemies, that will probably not matter so much.

Note that an <color:keypress>maa*5</color> macro only saves two keypresses per enemy over an <color:keypress>maa</color> macro, even if the spell is used more than once; and the <color:keypress>maa</color> macro itself only saves two keypresses per enemy compared to just pressing every key in the sequence m-a-a-*-5. This is because after the first cast, the single-key <color:keypress>n</color> command (<color:keypress>X</color> in the roguelike keyset) can be used to repeat both the spell and the targetting.
