=== Using the Online Help ===

* You can press Escape at any time to leave the online help.
* You can press Question Mark (?) to return to the previous help file.
* You can press Space to advance one page, or Return to advance one
  line.
* If you reach the end of the help file, you will wrap around to the
  start.
* You can press Minus (-) to back up one half page at a time towards the
  start of the help file (this is very inefficient).
* You can press Hash (#) to go to a specific line (this defaults to
  line zero).
* You can press Percent (%) to go to a specific file (this defaults to
  the index file for your system).
* You can press Equals (=) to highlight lines containing a string (this
  is not case sensitive).
* You can press Slash (/) to search for a string (this is also not case
  sensitive).
