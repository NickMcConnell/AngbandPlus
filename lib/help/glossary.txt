<style:title>The FrogComposband Glossary</style>

While playing FrogComposband, discussing it with other players, or even just reading the help files, you are likely to run into many esoteric game concepts, mysterious abbreviations, or words that have specific meanings within the game. It is by no means necessary for a new player to read this file before starting play - most players can (and do) just figure things out as they go along, the glossary includes many advanced topics in addition to the basics, and all the important concepts are also covered elsewhere in the help. But you can refer to this list as a quick cheat-sheet if you are unsure about a particular word or game concept, or just read the whole thing for your amusement :)

See <link:objects.txt#InscriptionAbbrev> for item attribute abbreviations.
