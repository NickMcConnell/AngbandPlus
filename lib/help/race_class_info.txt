*******races
There are many different races that you can choose from, most representing the speaking peoples found in Tolkien's books.  Races differ in vital statistics, and tend to be better at some abilities than at others.  Good races for new players are Dunedain and High-Elves (powerful but slow at gaining levels), and Elves and Dwarves (good abilities, not too slow at gaining levels).
*******<end>

*******Human
A flexible and adaptive race, humans are found all over Middle-Earth, from desert Harad to icy Horodwaith.  The human is the base character.  All other races are compared to them.  Humans are average or below average at everything.  They have no special adjustments to stats, no intrinsic abilities, and no special strengths or weaknesses.  This, combined with their solid hitpoints, makes them flexible but not powerful adventurers.
*******<end>


*******Elf
Known as the Elder Race, and as the First-Born, Elves are famed for their knowledge and craftsmanship.  They tend to be smarter and more dexterous than either humans or half-elves, but not as wise or strong.  Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they somewhat weak in melee.  They are fond of bows, and have some infravision.  Elves are resistant to attacks involving bright light, and have their dexterity sustained, and are native to forest terrain.
*******<end>

*******Half-Elf
Half-elves are the descendants of Elves and Humans.  Half-elves tend to be smarter and more dexterous than a human,  but not as wise or strong.  Half-elves are slightly better at magic, disarming, saving throws, stealth, bows and searching, but they are are somewhat weak at melee.  Half-elves have their dexterity sustained, and are native to forest terrain.
*******<end>

*******Hobbit / Halfling
Hobbits, or halflings are shy, retiring folk with enough good sense to share.  They live in homes with circular entranceways built partially underground, and are the smallest of all the races.  Although they are weak, have perilously few hitpoints, and are very poor at melee, they are extraordinary at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They make excellent rogues, but prefer to be called burglars.  Hobbits are highly intelligent, dexterous, have fair infravision, and good saving throws.  They resist attacks on their life force, and are thus intrinsically resistant to life draining.
*******<end>

*******Gnome
Gnomes are the pudgy pranksters of the dungeon; if they can kill something in a humorous way, so much the better. They are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings.  They, like hobbits, live in the earth in burrow-like homes.  Gnomes make excellent mages, and have very good saving throws.  They are good at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They have lower strength than humans, and are among the frailer races, so they are not very good at melee attacks.  Gnomes have fair infra-vision and, most importantly, are intrinsically protected against paralysis and some slowing effects.
*******<end>

*******Dwarf
Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior or priest - or indeed, that combination of the two, the paladin.  They are strong, wise, tough, and have pretty good basic skills.  Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than humans.  Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise, they resist spells which are cast on them.  Dwarves also have very good infra-vision because they live underground.  Although not very good at casting spells, they make excellent priests.  Dwarves are quite good at melee combat, and -- a major advantage -- cannot be blinded.  They do have one big drawback, though:  Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud; singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.
*******<end>

*******Half-Orc
The offspring of a human and an orc, half-orcs are ugly, strong, and have very bad attitudes.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Their magic is a little suspect, as are most of their skills, but they know how to fight and can take as much damage as they dish out.  Most other races dislike them and so they have a hard time in stores.   Half-Orcs do make good warriors and rogues, for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots of hit points.  Because of their preference to living underground rather than on the surface, half-orcs have innate infravision and resist darkness attacks.
*******<end>

*******Half-Troll
Half-trolls are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.  They are built like blocks of granite; no other race can match their strength.  They recover hit points quickly, but unfortunately this regeneration also requires them to eat more food than other races.  They have more hit points than any other character race.  Their hand-to-hand combat prowess is fearsome and they are amazingly tough.  Unfortunately, they do poorly at almost everything else, are very noisy, need to eat a lot, and have a hard time in stores.  Half-trolls will be bad at anything that requires heavy thinking.  They have innate infravision and always have their strength sustained.  They will make great warriors and challenging priests.  They also happen to be fun to play...
*******<end>

*******Dúnadan
The Dúnedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder race surpasses the abilities of other humans in every field and has superior vital statistics.  However, being men of the world, very little is new to them, and levels are very hard to gain.  Their constitution cannot be reduced.
*******<end>

*******High-Elf
High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard and answered the call from the Valar at the very beginning of time, before the sun and moon were made, and lived in the Blessed Realm for long ages before returning to mortal lands.  They are masters of all abilities, and are agile and intelligent, although their wisdom is a little suspect.  No other race is quite as good at magic, and none is so skilled with missile weapons.  High-elves are able to see the unseen, have good infravision, and have innate resistance to light. However, having lived so long and learnt so much, it is very hard for them gain levels.
*******<end>

*******Kobold
Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell underground.  However, they are weaker than humans, and also not noted for great intelligence.  Furthermore, they are ugly, and not trusted in town.  They are dexterous, and while their constitution makes them tough, it still cannot prevent the fact that they are not the biggest of creatures, and have few hit points.  Kobolds can see in the dark better than almost any other race, are very stealthy, and -- their most important advantage -- are intrinsically resistant to poisons of all kinds.
*******<end>

*******classes
Your choice of class makes all the difference to how the game plays.  They vary greatly in toughness, combat and magic power, and ability to notice, detect, and avoid things.  Some suggested classes for new players are warriors and paladins.
*******<end>

*******Warrior
A hack-and-slash character who solves most of his problems by cutting them to pieces.  He is unchallengeable with melee weapons, and is also good with all missile launchers.  He becomes resistant to fear at level 30, and gets an extra attack at level 26.  His prime stats are Strength and Constitution, and a good Dexterity can really help at times.  Although a warrior gets a lot of hitpoints, he is poor at the dungeon survival skills, vulnerable to magic, and suffers greatly from his ignorance of spells and many magical devices.  He gets fast, detailed feelings on weapons and armour (pseudo-ID).
*******<end>

*******Mage
A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat, deceive, confuse, and escape.  A mage is not really complete without an assortment of magical devices, and finds them very handy when his mana runs low.  He can master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and has the best saving throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.  Intelligence and Dexterity are his primary stats.  He has almost no chance of sensing wargear (slow, weak pseudo id).  There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm.  Intelligence is his spell stat.
*******<end>

*******Priest
A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  He explores the dungeon only to cleanse the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to fall into his pack, well, so much more to the glory of the Church!  Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose which spells they will learn.  A Priest is familiar with magical devices, preferring to call them "Instruments of God", but is not as good as a mage in their use.  A priest can be a decent fighter, especially when sanctified, but only with blunt or blessed weapons.  Unblessed edged weapons (swords and polearms) violate the Church's strictures about shedding blood, and wielding one will hurt his ability to pray successfully.  A Priest has fast but weak pseudo-ID.  Wisdom is his prayer stat.
*******<end>


*******Rogue
A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He is a master of traps and locks, no device being impossible for him to overcome.  A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneak around many creatures without having to fight, or sneak up and get the first blow.  A rogue's perception is higher than that of any other class, and ofttimes he will notice a trap or secret door without having to search.  A rogue is better than warriors or paladins with magical devices, but still cannot rely on their performance.  Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the powerful offensive magic mages cast.  A rogue has moderately fast, detailed pseudo-ID.  Intelligence is his spell stat.  Rogues can set traps for unsuspecting monsters.  As the rogue gains levels, he can create an increasing variety of traps modifying an existing monster trap.  He is exceptionally gifted with a sling, and gets an extra shot with a sling when he reaches level 26.
*******<end>

*******Ranger
A ranger is is a warrior/druid, and is the the greatest of bowmen.  He can also hold his own in melee, and has some useful incantations to aid him in need; rangers have many talents.  The ranger learns spells much more slowly than a druid, but is capable of learning all but the most powerful incantations.  Because a ranger is really a dual class character, more experience is required for him to advance.  His primary stats are Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom and Dexterity.  A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, good searching, a good saving throw, is native to forest terrain, and is good with magical devices.  A ranger has average-speed, weak pseudo-ID.  Intelligence and wisdom are his spell stats.  He gets an extra shot with a bow at level 26.
*******<end>

*******Paladin
A paladin is a champion of the Faith.  He is a very good fighter, just below than the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons.  A paladin receives prayers at a slower pace then the priest, but can use all but the most powerful prayers.  A paladin has slowish but detailed pseudo-ID.  Because a paladin is really a dual class character, it requires more experience to advance him.  A paladin lacks much in the way of abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and magical devices.  He has a decent saving throw due to his divine alliance.  His primary stats are Strength and Charisma, although Wisdom is necessary for his prayers.
*******<end>

*******Brigand
A Brigand is a thief, who simply wants to plunder the pits of Angband to steal its greatest treasures.  He is close behind the warrior in melee.  He is a very good at disarming of traps and locks, no device being impossible for him to overcome, and has the highest stealth of all classes, which can frequently let him choose his fights.  His dungeon survival skills are better than average, and he has a fast, detailed pseudo-ID.  As the brigand gains levels, he can create an increasing variety of traps by altering an existing monster trap.  He is exceptionally gifted with a sling, and gets an extra shot with a sling when he reaches level 26.
*******<end>

*******Druid
A Druid is a master of all things natural, and cannot hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon.  So he must therefore call upon the power of nature for attack and defense.  A druid is not really complete without an assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his incantations.  He has almost no chance of sensing wargear (slow, weak pseudo id).  He can master the higher level magical devices easily, and has a very good saving throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.  Intelligence and Wisdom are his spell stats.  He is the weakest fighter of all the classes, and incantations are his true realm.
