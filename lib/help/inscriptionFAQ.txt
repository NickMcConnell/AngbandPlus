
A Really Quick Guide to Magic Inscriptions

There are a number of special things you can inscribe (with the '{'
command) on your equipment and inventory to make playing Angband more
convenient.


        Definitions

'n' is a number from 0-9

'c' is a command from the underlying command set. (Almost, but not
completely, like the orginial command set, which uses some keymaps so
you don't need to know that ';' is the walk command, and such. See the
help file command.txt for these.)


        Inscriptions

'!c' - Ask for confirmation when you select this item to use with
command 'c'.

'!*' - Ask for confirmation when you select this item to use with any
command.

'@n' - When you type 'n' at a what object? prompt for any command, use
this item. (If more than one item has this inscription, it uses the
first one.)

'@cn' - As above, but only when selecting objects for command 'c'.

For both of these, if the first matching inscription in your inventory
is an illegal choice, it will stop there, not go on to a legal one.

These two are especially useful in macros, since they allow you to make
a macro to use rod '2', for instance, and not have to worry about what
inventory slot it is currently in. Or, for making macros of spells, it
causes the macro to fail if all your copies of the appropriate book are
destroyed, moving a different book into the same slot.

'^c' - While this item is equipped, ask for confirmation of command 'c'.

'=g' - Pick this item up when you step on it.


        Examples

@q1
    Use this as item '1' when quaffing a potion. 
@m1!d!k!v
    Use this as item '1' when casting a spell. Ask for confirmation
    before dropping, destroying, or throwing the item. This is probably
    your first spellbook. 
@m1@b1@G1!d!k!v
    As above, but it is also item '1' when browsing your spellbooks or
    gaining new spells. 
@w0^;^.
    Use this as item '0' when weilding. Ask for confirmation before
    walking (';') or running ('.') with this item equipped. This is
    probably your shovel or pick. (The game attaches the command 'w0' to
    the 'X' key by default, so you can swap between your shovel and
    weapon by inscribing both with '@w0'.) 
@z0!*
    Use this as item '0' when zapping a rod. Ask for confirmation before
    doing anything with this item, including zapping it. This is
    probably your Rod of Recall. 
!*!*!*!*!*
    Ask for confirmation five times before doing anything with this
    item. I don't know what this is, but you're worried about accidents.
