<style:title>Targetting</style>

The targetting prompt offers many options, and two different modes: <color:keyword>monster-targetting mode</color> and <color:keyword>free-targetting mode</color>. If there are hostile monsters in line of sight, targetting begins in monster-targetting mode; the first target offered will be the nearest such monster, with other hostile monsters in line of sight as alternative targets. Use direction keys to cycle between monsters; <color:keypress>+</color> and <color:keypress>-</color> also work, but are less intuitive. Turn on the <color:keyword>target_pet</color> option (<link:option.txt#target_pet>) if you want this mode to allow non-hostile monsters as targets.

If you wish to target (or inspect) a square with no monster on it, press <color:keypress>p</color> or <color:keypress>o</color>, switching to free-targetting mode where direction keys simply move the cursor. (This mode is automatically entered if no hostile monsters are in line of sight.) <color:keypress>o</color> and <color:keypress>p</color> are identical except in one respect: pressing <color:keypress>p</color> (which stands for <color:keyword>player</color>) moves the cursor to your own location, while pressing <color:keypress>o</color> (which stands for <color:keyword>offset</color>) does not. 

At any time, press <color:keypress>5</color>, <color:keypress>t</color> or <color:keypress>.</color> to accept the current target (and exit targetting mode), <color:keypress>q</color> or <color:keypress>ESC</color> to exit targetting mode without selecting a target, <color:keypress>r</color> to recall lore about a monster on the target square, <color:keypress>x</color> to see all items on the target square (including stolen or picked-up items carried by monsters, but excluding normal monster item drops), and <color:keypress>(</color> to select a square as a travel target. In the original keyset, <color:keypress>J</color> and <color:keypress>j</color> also work as travel keys and are equivalent with <color:keypress>(</color>.

Users of the roguelike keyset have a bonus option in free-targetting mode: they can press <color:keypress>Shift+DIR</color> to move the cursor many squares at a time.

<topic:Precision><style:heading>Precision Targetting</style>

When you cast a spell or fire a missile at a target location, the path chosen is the <color:keyword>direct</color> path towards that location, which may or may not be the path you want. Sometimes, by clever choice of a side location as your target, you may be able to aim at squares not directly in line of sight:

Notice that bright-red <color:R>*</color>? There's a dragon on that square I cannot target directly; but I managed to include that square in my spell's path by using <color:keypress>p</color> to target a location on the southern edge of the map.

Note that bolt spells always stop at the first monster in the spell's path, but beam and breath spells affect all squares in their paths, and ball spells can reach the target square by flying over monsters' heads if necessary.

<topic:TargetTypes><style:heading>Location Targets vs Monster Targets</style>

When selecting a target, you may target either a <color:keyword>monster</color> or a <color:keyword>location</color>. This is an important difference: if you target a monster, the target will move when the monster moves; but if you target a location, the target remains stationary, even if the location had a monster in it. 

If you bypass targetting mode you can also target a <color:keyword>compass direction</color>, which for this purpose is always equivalent to targetting a <color:keyword>location</color>, even if there was an obvious monster in the direction indicated. So watch out if there's a monster due west of you, you fire west and then spam <color:keypress>n</color> (or <color:keypress>X</color> in the roguelike keyset) to repeat: this will work beautifully as long as the monster remains due west, but as soon as it moves north or south you will need to retarget, something you would not have needed to do had you selected the monster as your target.
