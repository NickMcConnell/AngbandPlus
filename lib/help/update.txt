Cthangband
Based on Zangband 2.1.0e

Changes are added to the top of this file, so for a chronological order
read from the bottom up.

Cthangband 4.1.0 (the first under the maintainership of David Thornley)
* Any character starting with Shaman skill gets one free spirit bound.
* Any character with hermetic magic skills will get one free spellbook to start.
* Pets will not be targetted by the "*" key.
* There are new base skill levels, essentially the level learnable at 0', and 
  these are subtracted from the skill learnable at the current dungeon level;
  for example, it is possible to raise Toughness above 3% at 50'.
* Raising Martial Arts skill now does not depend soley on Close Combat skill.
* Certain changes have been made to allow the roguelike keyset to work better.
* Characters with sufficiently high missile skill get extra shots, depending
  on weapon type.  The most shots are available with a bow, next a sling,
  next a crossbow.
* There is now a visual cue, in the "depth" area, as to whether you are in a 
  dungeon or tower.
* Corrected bug whereby characters with Mindcrafting of 80% or better did not 
  get ESP.
* A character trying to cast a cantrip from a charm unsuccessfully may get no
  effect, rather than destruction of the charm, at very low skill levels.
* Additional documentation has been added.  Most of the differences between 
  Vanilla Angband and Cthangband are now in the "Help" files.
(Thanks to Kieron Dunbar for the following ideas, and, sometimes, code.)
* The display has been changed to show spirits and how annoyed they are.
* *Identified* weapons show what skill they need.
* The restriction on a 6% failure rate to learn magical skills has been replaced
  by a restriction that character skill must be no more than 50% greater than 
  the minimum skill for that spell, mindcrafting power, cantrip, or spirit 
  favor.
* Minimum annoyance for spirit favors has been raised to 2, so a spirit will not
  immediately become placated for the next turn.

Cthangband 4.0.1
* Wizard Mode moved to 'Cheat Options' page.
* 'graf-new' flag removed since we only have Adam Bolt tiles these days.
* Paths are now lit like floors.
* Startup options have their own option page, to reduce the number of
  questions the player is asked when creating a new character.
* Dungeons (but not towers) display offset depth, rather than true
  depth.
* Player ghosts now use graphics if possible.
* 'Dungeons' may now be towers (tiny levels heading upwards) as well as
  caves (larger levels heading downwards).
* 5 new dungeons added.
* Dungeons now have a 'bias' towards a certain type of creature.
* Charm destruction and identify staff bugs fixed (thanks to Greg
  Wooledge).
* Bug in spell energy calculation fixed.
* Skills can only be improved if you are not bored (i.e. there is a
  minimum depth requirement based on your current skill value.)
* Hedge magic is now easier to learn.
* Skills are now slightly randomised on character generation.
* Fixed bug with 100% Toughness reducing your hitpoints.
* Spirits now have elvish/hobbitish names, rather than Cthuloid.
* Character dump now dumps last 10 messages (so you can see how stupidly
  you died).
* Problem with 'missing' options fixed.
* 'Wizard Mode' flag is cleared with cheat flags on character creation.
* Extra cheat option - 'cheat_skll' to view skill checks.
* Toughness is only increased when you lose more than 1/20th of your
  current hit points in a single hit.
* Magic skills only improve if there was a 10% failure chance (or
  greater) for the spell/favour/power/cantrip.
* No experience is gained on the surface, only in dungeons
* Attacks only improve your attack skill (and/or martial arts) if you
  have less than 75% chance to hit.
* Attacks with mutations (Horns, Tail etc.) give experience to your
  'close combat' skill, not your weapon skill.

Cthangband 4.0.0
* Windows version has updated menus and faster repaints and can now use
  monospaced system fonts as well as bitmap fonts. (From Tim Baker's
  version of Kamband.)
* Player breath weapons (from dragon plate or mutations) and 'wands of
  dragon breath' now use cone shaped attacks.

  get prompted for twice.

  Cthuloid entities.

* Monster breaths are now cone shaped, rather than ball shaped (from
  Zangband)
* Speed system cleaned up (a lot) with regard to spellcasting.
* 'help.hlp' is now system specific ('help-dos.hlp' etc.) so that it can
  point to a different set of files for the different interfaces and
  systems.
* Windows version asks for a savefile name when starting a new file,
  rather than automatically naming it after the character that is
  generated.
* 'New Game' and 'Load Game' on Windows interface changed to 'New
  Savefile' and 'Load Savefile' as some people were confused and thought
  that they needed to use the 'New Game' command after they had died.
