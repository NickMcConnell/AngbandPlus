#####R=== Hobbits ===

#####GDescription
Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have good 
saving throws. They also are very good at searching, disarming, perception,
and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to be called 
burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting.
Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a 
distance. Hobbits can choose between being a warrior, mage, or rogue. 
They have their dexterity sustained and in time they learn to cook a 
delicious meal from available ingredients.
