#####R === PernAngband Magic - Valarin Realm ===

The Valar, stewards of Eru, possess the inherent power of the world
itself. Drawing out the enchantments of earth, water, and air, the 
Valarin realm harnesses light and life to aid its devotees.  Having 
the fullest complement of healing spells, the primeval powers of the
universe can also be unleashed in lightning and earthquake and even
the rain of falling stars. The highest power given to followers 
allows them to become equal in power to the Valar themselves, albeit
for a limited time.

It contains many healing spells, a few self-altering spells, some 
attack spells and some utility spells.
