<style:title>Warlocks</style>

A Warlock is a magical class but, unlike normal spellcasters, they derive their powers, stats, skills and bonuses by making a pact with a given class of monsters. This pact is irrevocable and is made at the outset of the Warlock's career. Depending on the class of monsters with whom they ally, the warlock will gain unique bonuses, abilities and magical powers. For example, alliance with the forces of the netherworld grants resistances to poison and nether, enhanced constitution and spells to control and conjure the unliving as well as spells to access the damaging forces of the netherworld directly. Each such alliance has thematic bonuses and powers, and you can read the details in the respective help sections. On final comment: allying with a given class of monsters dramatically reduces the warlock's ability to fight these foes. Instead, the warlock seeks cooperation with their brethren, or, perhaps, domination over them. But direct assaults are rarely successful.
 
In addition to pact related spells, all warlocks gain access to the unique power of the Eldritch Blast. Their primary spell stat is Charisma since they seek dominion and alliance with their chosen kin, and these monsters tend to have a strong will of their own, resisting the binding forces which the warlock imposes to gain both mastery and power.

<topic:Undead><color:o>Undead</color>
Undead are tough creatures, each having survived death at least once. Warlocks who make a pact with Undead will find themselves gaining additional resistances such as cold, poison, darkness and nether. In addition, they will be able to see their kind, which tend to be invisible, and gain resistance to life draining forces. They will also gain access to undeadly powers, which typically involve detection and control over the forces of the netherworld. In the end, this pact will allow its practitioners to destroy monsters with a single word, and, perhaps, to even partially leave the world of the living altogether. Of course, allying with the undead substantially reduces the warlock's ability to fight these creatures.

<topic:Dragons><color:o>Dragons</color>
The bond between a Dragonrider and a Dragon is one of the strongest and most enduring ties seen the world over. Each draws strength, power, and encouragement from the other, and together they make a formidable foe. An alliance with Dragonkind enables this bond to form, and the Warlock of this pact gains impressive powers for mounted combat. Indeed, they are among the elite riders of the world, only slightly inferior to Cavalry and Beastmasters. But where they have a slight deficiency in skill (and perhaps in melee as well), they have a strong advantage in riding techniques and magical enhancements. Dragonriders favor the lance above all other weapons and seek continuously for the lengendary 'Dragonlance' which they view as their long lost birthright.

<topic:Angels><color:o>Angels</color>
Angels are heavenly beings who use a variety of techniques to smite those they view as evil. Warlocks who make pacts with Angels will also find their saving throws significantly improved, and (eventually) their body immune to bolt-like effects. Since Angels are strongly aligned with the forces of good, making a pact with Angels will reduce damage done to all good monsters by a substantial amount.

<topic:Demons><color:o>Demons</color>
Demons are crafty creatures of the netherworld, using whatever means at their disposal to bring down their enemies. Warlocks who make pacts with Demons will find their abilities to use all magical devices improved, and gain the ability to Recharge these devices at will. Eventually, Demon Warlocks attain the ability to crush walls beneath their footsteps. Making a pact with Demons will reduce damage done to all demons by a substantial amount.

<topic:Hounds><color:o>Hounds</color>
An alliance with hounds is one of the weaker pacts the warlock may make. Hounds are fast, stealthy and nimble, and the warlock will gain these attributes as well, in addition to basic elemental resistances. They also gain decent melee, but other skills, especially device skills, are somewhat lacking. Of course, they may call on their kin for assistance, but this may not be enough against the more difficult foes of the world. Still, hounds are very common and many consider them to be annoying as well, so perhaps an alliance is in order?

<topic:Spiders><color:o>Spiders</color>
Of all the icky, crawling things in the world, you have chosen to make an alliance with spiders? Sure, they are stealthy, and fast, and very adept at hiding. Able to extrude a fine sticky substance to ensnare the unwary, the spider lurks nearby, or so you assume since you very seldom see them. Moreover, many spiders are adept at the powers of teleportation, able to jump quickly from one location to another, which can be quite baffling to a would be predator. They are comfortable with both poison and nexus. But, aside from all of this, they are a bit on the squishy side. That is, if you can manage to catch one!

<topic:Giants><color:o>Giants</color>
An alliance with giants and titans grants impressive physical strength and fortitude, but other stats will generally suffer. Later in life, you will gain giant-like resistances including sound, shards and chaos. Your combat will be impressive, but, like giants, you will favor heavy weapons. Oh, and you won't mind tossing a boulder or two should the need arise. Since this alliance offers so much in the way of physical advantages, it offers very little in the way of magical abilities or skill. Warlocks with this alliance are the best possible fighters being nearly indistiguishable in skill from Warriors!
