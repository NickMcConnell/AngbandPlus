#####R=== Gnomes ===

#####GDescription
Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like the 
hobbits, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent 
mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching, 
disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans 
so they are not very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair 
infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance. A 
gnome may choose between being a warrior, mage, priest, or rogue. Gnomes 
are intrinsically protected against paralysis and some slowing effects. At
higher levels, Gnomes learn to teleport at will.
