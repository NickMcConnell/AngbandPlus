<style:title>Defending and Armor</style>
 
Monsters may damage and otherwise harm you in a number of ways: in direct melee combat, by exploding next to you, by breathing on you and by casting spells. Some monsters referred to as "summoners" may not directly harm you but may summon other monsters to do their dirty work for them.

Creatures will attack you in the same manner in which you attack them. If they move into you, they attack you. Virtually all monsters can lower your hit points by means of a melee attack, and if you lose too many, you die. Fortunately, this is also the attack most easily guarded against (by wielding armor). Each monster has a maximum of four melee attacks which may be of varying type, power and effect.

In addition to pure damage, there can be a number of side-effects from a monster hitting you. For example, an especially powerful attack may stun you wound you. Stunning is cumulative and, if not addressed, may eventually result in you becoming knocked out which allows your opponent to continue attacking while you lie helpless. Wounds will cause you to lose hit points each round until you either die or your wound heals. You will slowly recover from any wound except a Mortal Wound with time and all wounds can be healed magically.

In addition to cuts and stunning, some monsters melee attacks may have other consequences. These include causing you to become blind, scared, confused, poisoned or paralyzed. There are many others less common effects. Full details of monsters melee ability may be found in the section on Monsters (see <link:monster.txt>).

Many monsters also have an array of magical spells which they may use against you and others can use various breath attacks on you from a distance. For example, a red dragon might breathe fire at you. You can defend yourself from the side-effects of melee attacks, monster spells and breath attacks by searching for armor that is resistant to that form of attack.

As you move down deeper into the dungeon in search of better items, you will need to steadily improve your defenses against pure damage, wounds, stunning, bolts, balls, and breaths of various kinds, reductions of exp and stats, theft, and a variety of miscellaneous magical attacks.

<topic:Armor><style:heading>Armor Class</style>

Your armor class (or AC) is a number that describes the amount and the quality of armor being worn. Armor class will generally run from about 0 to 150, but could become negative or greater than 150 with rarer armor or by magical means. Note the spell casters receive a penalty to their maximum mana for wielding armor that is too heavy. In addition, monks lose much of their bare handed fighting skill if their armor becomes too heavy.
 
The larger your armor class, the more protective it is. A negative armor class would actually help get you hit. Armor protects you in three manners. One, it makes you harder to be hit for damage. A hit for no damage is the same as a miss. Two, good armor will absorb some of the damage that your character would have taken from normal attacks. Three, acid damage is reduced by wearing body armor (but the armor will be damaged instead). It is obvious that a high armor class is a must for surviving the deeper levels of PosChengband. Note, however, that armor class by itself will not protect you from the side effects of monster melee attacks mentioned above.

Each piece of armor has a base armor value, which, like the damage from weapons, is assumed known by the player, and a magic bonus, which will not be displayed unless the armor has been identified or was bought in a store.

Armor class values are always displayed between a set of brackets as '[#]' or '[#,+#]'. The first value is the armor class of the item. The second number is the magical bonus of the item which is only displayed if known, and will always have a sign preceding the value.

Note: A few rings, amulets, and weapons also have the '[+#]' notation, indicating that they provide an armor bonus. Many pieces of heavy body armor will also have a '(-#)' before the '[#,+#]', which indicates that the weight of the armor decreases your chances of hitting monsters. This can range from nonexistent for very light armor to (-8) for the very heaviest armor!

<topic:ResistingMagic><style:heading>Resisting Magical Attacks</style>

Against some magical attacks (such as cause wounds, cause blindness or cause fear) the player will first get a saving throw (see the Skills page). However, against attacks such as bolts and ball spells this does not apply. Also, there is no saving throw against monster breaths. For these types of attacks, your only recourse it to find items or other means which grant you 'resistance' to that type of attack.

There are many forms of resistance which may be obtained either as bonuses from your equipment, as the result of casting a magical spell, activating certain artifacts or as the result of a mutation. Unfortunately, not all attacks available to monsters can be resisted and most can only be partially resisted.

Each resistance has one or more corresponding monster attack which it 'resists'. By this we mean that it reduces the amount of damage that your character will take as a result of an attack of that kind. For example, fire resistance will reduce the damage to your character resulting from fire attacks such as a fire bolt or being breathed upon by a red dragon. Note that appropriate resistances will also negate or reduce some side-effects of monster melee attacks.

There are two categories of resistances: (1) the low (or elemental) resistances - acid, fire, cold and electricity; and (2) the high resistances - poison, confusion, light, dark, blindness, sound, fear, shards, nexus, chaos, nether, gravity, disenchantment and time. In general, the low resistances are more commonly available.

<topic:EgoArtifact><style:heading>Ego Armor and Artifacts</style>

In addition to the ordinary armor items your character may find in the dungeon, some of them may be endowed with additional powers. These armors are fall into two types(1) artifacts; and (2) ego armors. Unlike artifacts which are unique and may only be found once in each game, it is not unusual to find several ego armors of the same type during the course of a character's adventures.

In general, artifacts and ego armors may boost one or more of your primary statistics, may confer certain abilities upon your character and may grant resistance to certain forms of attack. Each Ego type may only be found on certain types of armor - for example, you can find a Shield of Reflection but not Boots of Reflection; Boots of Speed but not Gloves of Speed; etc.

A list of the ego types and their bonuses is considered a spoiler, so won't be presented here. But keep in mind that this is one of my favorite areas of the game to modify, so what was true last release might be different now :)

<topic:Resistances><style:heading>The Resistances</style>

This section describes some of the various attack-types available to monsters and how they may be resisted. Note that all resistances work by reducing the appropriate damage by a certain percentage. This percentage is displayed to you on your Character Sheet and increases as you wear more sources of resistance (i.e., resistances <color:keyword>stack</color>). In addition, many attacks have special effects in addition to damage. Some of these are described below and may often be avoided or lessened with enough resistance. Note that lacking any of the <color:keyword>low resistances</color> can result in instant death once your player is deep enough, but often, the <color:keyword>high resistances</color> can be (perhaps just barely) survived. However, you will want to cover high resistances as well as these forms of attacks usually come with nasty side effects. In fact, covering all resistances is one major constraint on your player in the end game. Of course, you can play with a few resistance holes here and there if you know what you are doing, but the novice may often misjudge the dangers (For example, I remember fighting Cerberus without any Fire resistance back in the day, but I was as green as they come!).

  <indent><color:g>Acid</color>
Acid is a corrosive form of attack. Not only is it painful to you, the player, but it may also damage your armor and gear, including staves and scrolls. Acid Resistance will help reduce the damage you sustain, and may help to protect items in your pack from being destroyed, but it won't necessarily protect your armor from corrosion. In that matter, it is the attributes of the armor itself that matter. Use the <color:keypress>I</color>nspect command to see if the given piece of armor ignores acid based attacks. Many egos and all artifacts do, but other pieces of armor, even magically enchanted ones, do not.</indent>

  <indent><color:b>Electricity</color>
Electricity is quite shocking to experience up close ... and quite painful as well. You may suffer damage to your nervous system if you are exposed too often. In addition, lightning destroys rings and wands, and you can be almost certain that un-identified ring that just got fried was a Ring of Speed at last! Resistance to Electricity will help protect wands and rings in your pack from being destroyed (but not objects on the floor, of course). In addition, this form of attack is often quite deadly, and may kill an unprepared adventurer that foolishly dives too hastily.</indent>

  <indent><color:r>Fire</color>
In addition to causing physical damage to the player, fire based attacks are prolific destroyers of essential gear in your backpack. This is true of staves and scrolls, of course, and even more true of spellbooks. Many a mage has been left helpless when their last spellbook was fried by a stray fire ball! You will want Fire resistance to protect both the damage you sustain and the booty you carry.</indent>

  <indent><color:W>Cold</color>
Cold based attacks may destroy potions in addition to causing physical damage. Some potions are so rare, so precious and so essential that they must be protected at all costs. So not only can Cold based attacks kill you outright if you lack resistance, they can destroy valuable potions before you get a chance to use them.</indent>

  <indent><color:G>Poison</color>
Poison is a nasty form of attack. Not only does it immediately damage the player, but it also poisons them as well. When poisoned, the player will take damage every few game turns and may not regenerate hitpoints normally. Poison can also damage you health, so is best avoided. On the bright side, poison will not destroy objects so you don't need to worry about your gear. However, I unresisted poison breaths are a major cause of death to the unwary, so you would be wise to cover this resistance as soon as possible (perhaps before DL40).</indent>

  <indent><color:y>Light</color>
You need light to see, it is true, but too much light can be blinding! When blinded, you won't be able to read scrolls or cast spells from a spellbook, so you might find yourself unable to escape a nasty situation. Light resistance reduces the damage from light based attacks and also, along with blindness resistance, helps protect your vision.</indent>

  <indent><color:D>Dark</color>
In addition to causing physical damage, darkness may also blind the player and darken the dungeon. Having resistance will protect your eyesight as well as your health. And be warned: Darkness Storms can actually be quite deadly in the late game!</indent>

  <indent><color:R>Confusion</color>
This form of attack is quite baffling, and I must confess to being puzzled as to how it manages to hurt the player, but it does. Of course, the main nastiness of this attack is that it causes <color:keyword>Confusion</color>, which prevents the player from casting spells, decreases their ability to activate devices, and even causes them to wander about haphazardly. Some monsters have confusing attacks and can trap the player: Each turn the player quaffs a potion to cure confusion, and each turn the monster attacks confusing the player anew. Beware and be warned!</indent>

  <indent><color:D>Nether</color>
An evil and deadly attack favored by the undead, nether can be quite deadly. It may also drain your life force. But the main risk of this attack is the sheer amount of damage it offers. The experience loss is secondary, and easily cured with the correct potion.</indent>

  <indent><color:v>Nexus</color>
Nexus attacks are one of the most annoying attacks but will rarely kill you directly. A Nexus attack will damage the player and may cause teleportation or even swap your primary statistics around. Now, pause a moment, and ponder what happens when nexus swaps the high intelligence of your (formerly) clever mage with, say, his low charisma? This can be a delayed form of insta-death ... no that doesn't make sense, but you might wish you died. Nexus resistance will reduce the damage taken from such attacks and may help prevent the side-effects but I recommend you run from those pesky Nexus Hounds!</indent>

  <indent><color:o>Sound</color>
Loud noises can be quite stunning as well as painful. While stunned, you may find it more difficult to attack, to cast spells and to use devices. Having resistance will help lessen the pain of sound based attacks as well as their stunning side effects.</indent>

  <indent><color:U>Shards</color>
Shard based attacks may cut as well as hurt. When cut, your life will literally bleed out of you with the passage of time, and the deeper the gash, the faster you will die. Having resistance will help prevent these cuts in addition to lessening the initial damage of the attack.</indent>

  <indent><color:v>Chaos</color>
Chaos attacks are one of the most dangerous attack types: If they don't kill you outright, their side effects might. You may find yourself a confused, hallucinating, mutated wretch, twisted by forces none may fathom and few live to boast of. Best to resist this one, if you can.</indent>

  <indent><color:v>Disenchantment</color>
The bane of magic, this form of attack seeks to rid the world of enchantments of all kinds. Not only might this reduce the quality of the equipment you wear (permanently!), it might even dispel the beneficial spells you weave. So while this is not quite the deadliest attack out there, you might be wise to avoid it as much as possible anyway.</indent>

  <indent><color:D>Blindness</color>
Resist blindness will protect you from spells which blind and from being "hit to blind" (a few monsters can do this) as well as from the blindness (but not the damage) caused by light and darkness breaths.</indent>

  <indent><color:R>Fear</color>
There is much in the world that may un-nerve the boldest hero, and you may find your courage failing just when you need it most. Some monsters terrify just by their presence alone while others might attempt magic to terrify you. Either way, Fear resistance is very important and you might find yourself unable to attack or cast spells ... or even move if you are trembling with fear. You may even become petrified with terror making you easy prey indeed!</indent>

In addition to these, there are other forms of attacks that you will encounter throughout the game. Most have side effects as well, and many cannot be resisted at all.

<topic:Immunities><style:heading>Immunities</style>

It is also possible that you may find items which grant immunity to one or (very occasionally) more of the low resistances (Acid, Fire, Cold and Electricity). In this case, when wielded, you will take no damage from attacks of the relevant kind and, in addition, your equipment and inventory are safe from being damaged or destroyed by the attack.

<topic:Miscellaneous><style:heading>Miscellaneous</style>

The following are not properly resistances but may be sensibly included on this page.

  <indent><color:r>Free Action</color>
Free action protects the player against paralyis, either from monster attacks, monster spells or traps. When paralyzed, the player is unable to move and quite vulnerable. Many monsters have evolved to paralyze their prey allowing them to feast at leisure. With <color:keyword>Free Action</color> the player will gain a saving throw versus this deadly effect. Multiple sources of free action allow multiple saving throws, but remember, each saving throw depends on the player's magic resistance so some characters will be more susceptible than others. Free action also speeds recovery when paralyzed, so even if you fail your saves, you will still probably survive as long as you have multiple sources. Missing a turn or two won't usually kill you, but if your AC is too low, you might just get paralyzed again! Eventually, you will die ... so be wary of certain monsters with this ability, especially in the early to mid game. Many monsters that paralyze don't move and are easily bypassed.</indent>

  <indent><color:y>Hold Life</color>
Having your life drained has either one of two effects: draining experience and draining life force. In the early game, it is generally the former and this effect, though annoying, is not too serious. <color:keyword>Hold Life</color> will protect you, giving you a saving throw versus the effect. If you fail, it also reduces the amount of experience drained, usually by about 90%, so getting a source of Hold Life is very convenient around DL40 or so. You can recover lost experience with a potion available in town at the <color:keyword>Temple</color>, so be sure to stock up ahead of time.

Having your life force drained is much more serious, and this effect is restricted to undead monsters or nether based attacks. Without a source of Hold Life to protect you, this effect can be quite dangerous once you begin fighting the powerful undead (especially the uniques). As your life force is drained, you become weaker and your opponent becomes stronger. Lose 10% of your life force and your max hitpoints are decreased by 5% while your opponent becomes 10% stronger. As your enemies feast on your life, they gain armor class, melee skill, melee damage and spell damage (except breaths). This can be quite problematic if you are fighting an evenly matched foe: as you weaken, they might quickly become more than you can handle, and could even kill you with a boosted darkness storm or similar foul magic. Against this form of attack, <color:keyword>Hold Life</color> is essential, and the more sources you have, the more saving throws you gain. If your life force is completely drained you don't become dead ... You become undead!</indent>

  <indent><color:D>See Invisible</color>
Some monsters are invisible, and cannot be seen by ordinary eyes. Needless to say, being attacked by something you cannot see is very frustrating, not to mention deadly! To address this, player's may gain <color:keyword>See Invisible</color> either from their equipment, from a potion or as a racial bonus. Several magic realms offer this ability as well either in one turn form or as a timed effect. However, even with See Invisible you may have a hard time perceiving invisible monsters. This ability gives the player a chance of detection and is no longer automatic. For each source of See Invisible, the player rolls for detection using their <color:keyword>Searching</color> skill. Some classes and races are rather unperceptive, and will have a harder time with invisible foes than, say, a High-elf rogue. If you are having trouble, try either getting multiple sources of See Invisible and/or magically improving your searching skill (as with Elven cloaks or helms of seeing). Quaff a potion of see invisible as well when under assault by a difficult foe ... These may be purchased in town in the <color:keyword>Alchemy Shop</color>.

Note that some invisible monsters are warm blooded. If the player has <color:keyword>infravision</color> then they may see the monster once it gets close enough. Many races offer intrinsic infravision and for those that do not, there are potions and magical bonuses to increase this ability. However, handling invisible foes with Infravision rarely works and it is much more important to get a permanent source of See Invisible as early as possible.</indent>

<topic:Recovering><style:heading>Recovering from Attacks</style>

You cannot combat monsters and expect to come out unscathed every time. When a monster inflicts damage on you, you will need to take steps to recover from the damage as soon as possible. If there is no danger about, you can simply rest until you recover. But if you are poisoned or cut, or if the battle continues to rage about you, then you will need magic to assist your healing. Various potions, devices and spells will assist you here.

Also, some attacks will temporarily drain your primary statistics, or perhaps your experience (life-force). You can restore both with certain potions and it might be wise to seek a healer in the town if you get too drained. I've also heard tale that certain wild mushrooms have a restoring effect here as well, but I don't recommend trying the unknown.
