Keyboard Commands
=================

Hellband can be controlled entirely from the keyboard.

Most commands consist of the pressing of a single key. Some need multiple 
keypresses - for example commands that ask for a direction or commands that ask 
for an object. If a command needs extra keypresses after the first, then you 
will be prompted at the top of the screen for whatever further input is needed.

Note that lower-case commands and upper-case commands are different from each 
other.

Basic Movement
==============

Hellband uses the number keys to move. They are as follows (on the numberpad, 
regardless of the status of NumLock)

7 8 9
 \|/
4-5-6
 /|\
1 2 3

These keys are used to move one square in each of the eight directions. The '5' 
key is used to stand still for a turn. When moving using these keys, items may 
or may not be picked up - depending on which options have been set.

Other Movement Commands
=======================

';' <direction>
Take a single step in a direction, picking up objects if your option settings 
are such that you normally do so.

'-' <direction>
Take a single step in a direction, picking up objects if your option settings 
are such that you do not normally do so.

'.' <direction>

Run in the specified direction (following turns in passages) until you encounter 
something 'interesting'. What is considered to be interesting depends on what 
options have been chosen.

','
Stand still, picking up objects if your option settings are such that you 
normally do so.

'g'
Stand still, picking up objects if your option settings are such that you do not 
normally do so.

'o' <direction>
Open a door or chest.

'c' < direction>
Close a door.

'D' <direction>
Disarm a trap.

'T' <direction>
Tunnel through the rock.

'+' <direction>
Either open, close, disarm or tunnel, depending on which action the computer 
thinks is most appropriate for the square that you have indicated.

'R' <duration>
Rest either for a number of turns or until healed or until something 
'interesting' happens. What is considered to be 'interesting' depends on your 
option settings.

's'
Search the squares around you for traps and/or secret doors. Note that this is 
not guaranteed to work, and you may need to search repeatedly to find something.

'S'

search each time you enter a new square. Search mode turns itself off 
automatically if you are interrupted.
