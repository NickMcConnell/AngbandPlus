#####R === PernAngband Magic - Nether Realm ===

The dominion of Morgoth has permanently altered the infra-structure
of the earth, imbuing it with his native power that is the Nether 
realm. The powers of the undead and corrupted life are at the call
of a Nether adept, as well as the invocations of haunting fear and 
eternal darkness. The lifeblood of the caster must sometimes be 
sacrificed to harness the awesome destructive potentials of the realm.

enhancing spells, and some self-altering spells.
