#####R=== Petty Dwarves ===

#####GDescription
The hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these cave-dwellers 
are not much bothered by darkness. Their natural inclination to magical 
items has made them immune to effects which could drain away magical 
energy, and like ordinary dwarves, they can examine the dungeon to 
discover traps and secret doors.
