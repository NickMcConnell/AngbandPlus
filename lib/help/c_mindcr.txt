#####R=== Mindcrafters ===

#####GDescription
The Mindcrafter is a character who uses the powers of mind instead of 
magic. These powers are unique to the Mindcrafter class, and vary from 
simple extrasensory powers to mental domination of others. Since these 
powers are developed by the practice of certain disciplines, a 
Mindcrafter requires no spellbooks to use them. The available powers 
are simply determined by the character level. The Mindcrafter uses the
wisdom score to determine how well he / she can perform these psychic 
powers, and in combat a Mindcrafter is roughly the equivalent of a 
priest, although a Mindcrafter is never penalized for wielding an edged
weapon (unlike a priest).

#####GPrimary Stats
Wisdom (spell casting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
Although the powers of a Mindcrafter may seem like magic, this is not 
-- strictly speaking --  the case. They are mental powers, independent 
of the ordinary sources of magic. Consequently,  Mindcrafters are not 
interested in 'magic' and learn no spells. These mental powers can be 
accessed through the "m" command.

#####GStarting Equipment
A mindcrafter begins the game with:
    A small sword
    A potion of restore mana
    Soft leather armor
If they are *very* lucky they may also begin with:
    ring of free action
