<style:title>The Newbie Guide</style>

Welcome to <color:keyword>PosChengband</color>! This guide will attempt to give you a quick overview of the game and get you started on your path to slay the dreaded Serpent of Chaos.

<topic:Overview><style:heading>Overview</style>

PosChengband is a single player role playing game where you, the brave adventurer, attempt to save the world by defeating evil monsters including, eventually, the <color:keyword>Serpent of Chaos</color>. The road is long, and the path is treacherous. Many have tried and failed, and the dungeons are littered with the bones of would be heroes. Do you have what it takes to succeed where so many others have failed? If so, read on.

<topic:CreatingACharacter><style:heading>Creating a Character</style>

Your first step will be to create your character. Since you are new to the game, I suggest you choose <color:keyword>Beginner Mode</color> at the initial prompt. This will greatly limit the complexity of the character creation process. After playing a few characters to get an idea of how to play, you can start a new character in <color:keyword>Normal Mode</color> to view all the options. Hey, it's not like your first character is going to win anyway!

After choosing Beginner Mode, the game is going to walk you through creating your character. You can refer to <link:birth.txt> for more detailed info, but the basics are that you will choose a sex, a race and a class and then roll for stats. While sex is not important (to the game), your race and class are key to everything that follows. Normally, the game has a vast (overwhelming?) array of choices that offer myriad, diverse playstyles, and it can take a while to even learn what is available. For now, we'll consider a few basic playstyles in order to get you going.

The easiest style is 'Hack and Slash' and it is the essence of the warrior. Almost any race will make a good one, but you might consider trying a High-Elf or a Hobbit. Both are stealthy and have good magic skills that will assist the warriors weak points. But if you really want to turn on the melee power, nothing beats a Half-Troll. Be warned: Trolls are ugly and stupid, not to mention widely hated. Shopkeepers are loath to sell to one as ugly as you so you'll have a harder time shopping. You can compensate by going on a killing rampage, which is more fun anyway. As a warrior, there isn't much strategy: simply find monsters and kill them! Look for better armor and weapons. Perhaps you can shoot a crossbow for a little bit of distance damage but your mainstay will be hand to hand combat. For stats, you'll want to start with 17 in both Strength and Dexterity and can ignore everything else.

Another style is to take the stealthy approach and play a rogue. Again, Hobbits and High-Elves are good for beginners. You'll want good fighting stats (Strength and Dexterity) as before, but this time, you also have the ability to cast magic spells. And while magic is not your forte, it eventually becomes very useful, so you'll want a decent Intelligence as well. (Every spellcaster has a primary stat for purposes of casting spells, and you can find this information out by reading the various class descriptions during the birth process, or by refering to the help files). Now you can't just roll 17 for every stat you need, so you'll need to be less greedy. I'd go with 16 for each, or perhaps 17 for Str and Dex and 14 for Int. Play around to see what you can get from the auto-roller. Also, once you pick your class, you'll need to pick a spell realm as well. Try Sorcery or, better yet, Burglary. Both have good detection but Burglary is uniquely designed for rogues allowing the player to do things like set traps and pick pockets. Fun stuff!

Finally, you can play with Magic as your forte as a mage. Gnomes and High-Elves are excellent choices here (Some would say that High-Elves are a munchkin race!). But magic takes some time to get good with, so I don't recommend this right away unless you are a patient person. Pick Chaos and then Sorcery for your spell realms and then roll a 17 Intelligence and a high Strength as well (say 15 or more). You'll need the Strength to carry goodies that you find in the dungeon. The Chaos realm gives good offense while Sorcery complements that with utility.

We'll discuss these three styles more as we proceed through this guide.

<topic:EquippingForDanger><style:heading>Equipping for Danger</style>

Once you have completed the birth process, you will find yourself in the town on the surface. Currently, you may choose to play <color:keyword>The World of Middle Earth</color> or <color:keyword>The World of Amber</color>. This document will assume the former, but both modules require wilderness exploration and both modules begin play in a starting town. After birth, you have some initial gear that varies with your class, and it should already be equipped for you. You also have a small amount of gold which you can use to augment your supplies for that first trip into danger.

So, what do you see at first?
<screenshot:tang01>
You (<$:@.hobbit.warrior>) begin life situated near your home (<$:FF_HOME>). Your home is present in almost every town and, somehow, all your stuff seems to follow you around, so you don't have to worry about where you stashed important items. Other buildings, such as the Weapon Smiths (<$:FF_WEAPON_SMITHS>) are shops where you may purchase supplies or sell your findings. You enter a shop by walking on top the entrance location. Once inside, you can press <style:keypress>?</color> for detailed help on how to interact with shop keepers. One final note: that <$:FF_RECALL> is a special <color:keyword>Wizard Tile</color> that allows free teleportation back and forth from the town and any dungeon you have visited. Most towns do not have such a luxury, and you must instead pay for recall services. In order for it to work, you must first enter a dungeon, which we will do shortly.

You can move about with the arrow keys and look about with the <color:keypress>l</color> command followed by the arrow keys. That <$:f.scrawny> is a monster and you should look at it with the <color:keypress>l</color> command to see if it seems threatening:

<screenshot:tang02>
Hmmm, probably no need to worry about Ms. Kitty.

If you are playing a mage, your first order of business is to learn a new spell (<color:keypress>G</color> to Gain a spell). At first level, you can only learn one, so make it count. I recommend learning Magic Missile first, assuming you followed my advice and chose the Chaos realm. As a mage, you really need to use magic to kill stuff so your first spell has to be something offensive. Later on, when you are more experienced, you may pick Detect Monsters from the Sorcery realm. To cast a spell, use the magic command (<color:keypress>m</color>) and follow the instructions. Not every class can learn a spell right away, however. A rogue, for example, must reach level 5 (CL5) in order to learn their first spell.

Next, you should shop for gear. I recommend buying some means of escape, such as scrolls of teleport or phase door from the Alchemy Shop (<$:FF_ALCHEMIST>). Also, you will want some means of healing from the Temple (<$:FF_TEMPLE>). If you are playing a rogue, try to buy a sling and some ammo (pebbles or shots) from the Weapon Smiths (<$:FF_WEAPON_SMITHS>). When you enter a store, you will see a list of inventory as well as a list of commands to use. Simply follow the instructions to make a purchase.
<screenshot:tang03>
After buying something, it will be added to your pack. Use the <color:keypress>i</color> command to view your pack:

<screenshot:tang04>
In my case, I bought a sling and some ammo (Each type of missile weapon uses a corresponding type of ammo. Obviously, arrows are for bows and bolts are for crossbows, so they wouldn't work with my sling!). Now the sling is doing me no good in my pack: I need to equip it first in order to use it in combat, and I do this with the <color:keypress>w</color> command, after which is it visible in the equipment list which can be viewed with the <color:keypress>e</color> command.
<screenshot:tang05>
To shoot something simply fire (<color:keypress>f</color>) one of your pebbles and see if you hit:

<screenshot:tang06>
Sorry about that, Ms. Kitty! I tried hard not to kill her, but she's just too weak!

I want you to notice a few things. First, as you play the game, notice that messages will be displayed in the top region of the screen. Back when I was a youngster, the game only had a single message line, and we hapless players were plagued with <color:B>-more-</color> prompts out the wazoo, not to mention sore fingers from all the extra keypresses! You may still get a <color:B>-more-</color> from time to time. If you do, simply press <color:keypress>SPACE</color> when you are finished reading and the next batch of output will be displayed. The messages will clear automatically after you enter your next command, so make sure you are done reading before pressing any keys. You can always review messages with the <color:keyword>Previous Messages</color> command (<color:keypress>CTRL+P</color>).

Next, there are some silly messages about your being a dishonorable brute. You can ignore these: they are simply messages about the morality of various actions your player takes. Over time, the game calculates your player's alignment which occasionally has game play consequences (For example, holy monsters are on a crusade against evil, and you wouldn't want to be too evil when fighting them!). Probably, I should disable the virtue system for <color:keyword>Beginner</color> mode, though.

Finally, notice my shot (<color:s>{</color>) laying on the ground next to (the remains of) Ms. Kitty. Sometimes your missile ammo will break on impact, but if it doesn't you'll want to go gather it up after you are done fighting. You can pickup objects by moving on top of them and using the get command (<color:keypress>g</color>).

Killing cats is fun, but it is time to move on. If you have money left over, go to the General Store (<$:FF_GENERAL_STORE>) and buy a lantern and some oil. Lanterns cast more light than torches and allow you to see further in the dark. Sell your starting torches. Oh, and be sure to equip your lantern to actually use it (<color:keypress>w</color> to wear an item).

Of course, it's possible that these items will not be available in the stores. The stores will "refresh" themselves every so often, getting rid of old items and buying new ones. If you ever find that there's something you need which the stores don't currently have, you can come back a bit later. However, to prevent <color:keyword>town scumming</color>, the stores won't actually restock unless you do a bit of adventuring first.

Hopefully, you managed all of this without too much trouble from the locals (<color:G>t</color>), but occasionally the townsfolk will interact with you. This may be simply annoying, as there are plenty of drunks about, but it can also be dangerous as urchins have been known to steal gold and you look like an easy mark. You can attack a monster by simply moving into it, assuming you have a weapon equipped. If you are playing a mage, you should learn your Magic Missile spell first (<color:keypress>G</color> allows you to Gain a spell) and fight with that instead (<color:keypress>m</color> allows you to cast a magic spell).

<topic:MyFirstTripDown><style:heading>My First Trip Down</style>

To enter a dungeon, you must first locate its entrance (<$:FF_ENTRANCE>) on the surface. Currently, <color:keyword>The Stronghold</color> is available close to the starting town in both the <color:keyword>Amber</color> and <color:keyword>Middle Earth</color> modules. You can locate the entrance in one of two ways. First, press the <color:keypress>M</color> key to view the surface map:
<screenshot:tang07>This is a compressed view of the surface terrain, but it allows you to see your current location relative to important terrain and objects. Now you know which way to go, and can move in that direction, re-checking the map to ascertain your progress.

But there is an easier way! Press <color:keypress>]</color> to bring up the <color:keyword>Object List</color>. Normally, you use this command in the dungeon to locate important treasures. But on the surface, you can also use it to navigate to a specific location. Simply position the cursor on the line for the entrance and press <color:keypress>`</color> to travel to that location:
<screenshot:tang08>You will then automatically go to the desired location, stopping if any monsters get in your way.

Once you have made it to the entrance, simple press <color:keypress>></color> to take the stairs down:

<screenshot:tang09>
Now that you have entered a dungeon, the town recall services will function so you don't need to walk back to the entrance any more (unless you need to save gold).

Now that you have made it someplace interesting, it is time to begin exploring. As you wander about, you will notice that the map display is updated, tracking your progress through the current level. You will need to be on your guard against monsters as you explore. Whenever you see something you don't know, use the look command (<color:keypress>l</color>) together with the recall option (<color:keypress>r</color>) to get a verbose monster description. For example:

<screenshot:tang10>
Uh Oh! It's Mr. Dog!! In this case a previous character had encountered and slain Mr. Dog, so I have some basic knowledge of this type of monster. This illustrates what the game calls <color:keyword>Monster Memory</color>. As you battle monsters, you learn more about them, and the game tracks your knowledge for you. All of the memory is retained in your savefile so that future characters may benefit. After killing a foe, you can recall details of your glory with the <color:keypress>/</color> command, followed by the letter representing the monster (<color:u>C</color> in this case) and then follow the prompts to choose the recall option. Notice that the description updates.

At this point, you basically explore the current level. You can walk back to town at any time by going back up those stairs you just descended. You can also find new stairs down to deeper depths. Basically, the deeper you go, the more difficult things become, so you'll want to take it easy on the stairs at first.

So, walk around a bit and kill stuff. Don't worry too much about dying as it will probably happen quite a bit at first. And if it does, the next time you load this savefile the birth process will give you an extra option to <color:keyword>Quick Start</color> this character, which basically skips the entire birth process and rolls a character identical to the last one. So it's easy to start up again after you die. (See, we streamline the common cases :)

So, I will continue to play a bit. You can just sit back and watch! ... Oops, I think I'm in trouble:

<screenshot:tang11>
Notice my <color:r>19</color> hp? Well, if my hp go below 0, I am dead. Also notice the very loud <color:v>*** LOW HITPOINT WARNING! ***</color>? This is to make sure you notice when you are in trouble. The game even forces me to press <color:keypress>SPACE</color> before continuing. Really, I think I am about to die!

<screenshot:tang12>
<color:v>Ouch!</color> That really hurt!

<screenshot:tang13>

Go ahead an play a bit. At this point, the tutorial is over and I'll just give some basic tidbits about the game.

<topic:Tidbits><style:heading>Tidbits</style>

Every monster uses a unique ASCII character that sort of tells you what it is. For example, rats use the letter 'r' while orcs use the letter 'o'. When you see a character you don't understand, press <color:keypress>l</color> to look at it. If it is a monster, you can then press <color:keypress>r</color> to recall information about it, including a description that will give you more information. Other characters like '/' and '!' represent objects that you may pick up (<color:keypress>g</color> to get) and then use.

How you use an object will depend upon its type. Some common examples are:
<style:screenshot>
Char  Object         Usage
====  ============== =========================================================
<color:U>,</color>     Food           <color:keypress>E</color> to eat it. Do this whenever you feel hungry.
<color:B>!</color>     Potion         <color:keypress>q</color> to quaff it. Try to identify the potion first.
?     Scroll         <color:keypress>r</color> to read it.
<color:R>?</color>     Spellbook      <color:keypress>b</color> to browse it. <color:keypress>G</color> to gain a spell. <color:keypress>m</color> to cast.

<color:U>]</color>     Misc. Armor    <color:keypress>w</color> to wear it.
</style>
If you want to know what a specific symbol stands for, type <color:keypress>/</color>, and then the symbol. For instance, if you're wondering what all the t's are, type <color:keypress>/t</color>, and the game will tell you that these are townspeople. You can also <color:keypress>l</color>ook at an item, feature, or monster. While looking, pressing space or enter will cycle through the different interesting things in view. There is also a full map function: type <color:keypress>M</color>. It will bring up a map of the entire area. Finally, if you type <color:keypress>L</color>, you can scroll the (full-zoom) map around the dungeon. In general, you can use <color:keypress>M</color> to find areas that look interesting and <color:keypress>L</color> to look at them in detail.

From here on we'll be giving detailed dungeon survival information. Some of it is intuitive, and some of it you aren't likely to find out without a lot of deaths first. If you want to experience the painful learning process in all it's glory, don't read further. If, however, you're sick and tired of dying, read ahead.
 
<topic:MultipleBlows><style:heading>On Weapons and Multiple Blows</style>

Some characters will start the game being able to get multiple blows per round with their weapon when attacking. Whether or not you get more blows than this later in the game will be determined by your class, your weapon weight, your Strength, and your Dexterity.

In my case, this is a newborn adventurer still using his starting dagger. But you'll notice that he is getting multiple blows per round, 2.74 in this case. What could that possibly mean? Actually, it's rather simple: 74% of the time I will get 3 attacks per round while 26% of the time, only 2. How is that number determined and what can I do to make it bigger? Good questions! The melee calculation is a little complicated, but basically it depends on the weapon and how heavy it is, your stats and how strong and dextrous you are, and your class. Rogues often get extra blows quicker, especially with lighter weapons. This is because their class favors light weapons such as daggers, and the game encourages this. Most other characters won't start with so many attacks. And you'll notice that while I get 2.74 attacks per round, my damage is rather pathetic (14 damage per round).

The Weapon Info screen also displays melee accuracy. Of course, you won't hit every time you swing. Accuracy depends on you skill with the weapon as well as its magical bonuses, if any. It also depends on your fighting skill (Shown on the initial Character Sheet above under the Skills section for Melee. My Melee skill is 'Excellent' in this case) which increases with stats (Strength and Dexterity) as well as experience (Level). All of this competes against the monster's armor class (AC). Basically, some monsters are harder to hit than others. Dragons are notoriously tough skinned, for example.

You may also see detailed information on your missile weapon in your character sheet. It is displayed right after the melee section (provided you are actually wielding a shooter), and can be quickly navigated to by pressing <color:keypress>s</color>:

In this case, you see I get multiple shots, but ranged combat works a bit differently than melee combat. Rather than taking all of your allowed shots in a single round, you take one at a time, but the game charges you less than the full amount of energy per shot. I haven't explained the speed system yet, but suffice it to say that less energy per action means you move faster, and can do more before any nearby monsters get a chance to act.

These two screens, Weapon Info and Shooter Info, will become more and more useful to you as you play the game. Don't worry if you don't understand everything displayed on them at the moment.

<topic:OnArmorAndResistance><style:heading>On Armor and Resistance</style>

We just saw how monsters have this attribute called armor class, and how this makes them harder to hit. Similarly, the player has an armor class which is determined by the armor they are currently wearing as well as their dexterity. In addition to making you harder to hit, AC also actually reduces the damage from certain types of melee attacks, so it is a very important attribute that you will want to increase as much as possible. If every you find yourself getting destroyed in melee, you'll want to look for better AC from your gear.

In addition to AC, though, the player has a very important set of resistances. Or, in this case, rather a lack of resistances. Scroll down to the equipment section of your character sheet, or press <color:keypress>e</color> to navigate more quickly. Here you get to see, in all its gritty detail, how woefully inadequate your starting character actually is. Here is my screen:

You'll notice a group of attributes for resistances and another for miscellaneous abilities along with some additional groupings for Slays and such. Let's just focus on Resistances for the time being.

So what is resistance and why should you care? Basically, monster attacks often have an elemental flavor to them. Their damage has a 'type'. For example, a fire breathing dragon breathes ... well, fire! And your fire resistance helps you withstand that particular type of damage. Many damage types also have effects as well. Sticking with our fiery example, this type of attack can destroy items in your pack, especially scrolls and spellbooks. Your fire resistance helps out here as well. Here is a short summary of attack types as well as when you'd like to have resistance. Be warned that some monster attacks can be very deadly, killing you in a single attack if you are unprepared!
<style:screenshot>
<color:w>Type       Comment
====       =============================================================</color>
<color:D>Acid</color>       Destroys scrolls/staves. Damages armor. DL30.
<color:b>Elec</color>       Destroys rings/wands and reduces Dex. DL30.
<color:R>Fire</color>       Destroys scrolls/staves/spellbooks. DL20.
<color:w>Cold</color>       Destroys potions. DL30.
<color:G>Poison</color>     Known to instantly kill many an adventurer. DL40
<color:R>Nexus</color>      Scrambles stats and teleports player. Not very damaging.
<color:r>Confusion</color>  Confuses you so you can't act. DL30.
<color:v>Paralysis</color>  Freezes the player so you lose turns. Get Free Action by DL30.

My character is not completely hopeless. Being a High-Elf, I begin with Light Resistance (30%) and See Invisible. The latter allows me to see ghosts and other invisible monsters. Without it, I wouldn't be able to see when certain monsters attack me, which can be very annoying, not to mention deadly. See Invisible (like Free Action) is one of the required abilities that you will want as soon as possible.

And while your race can grant resistances and abilities, most of the time these come from your gear. The 'abcd...' list across the top of each column corresponds to my current equipment set, and the corresponding item character is displayed if an item is actually equipped in that slot (e.g. | for my dagger, which is categorized by the game as a sword). So you can track your current resistances and abilities here as well as see where you are getting a given attribute. The '@' character corresponds to the player (displayed as an @, remember?) and lists innate racial abilities, as well as temporarily acquired magical enhancements (There might be a potion that grants temporary resistance, for example).

In general, you will want to cover as many resistances as possible. They are not so important early in the game, but as you descend deeper, you will learn what you need and when. Abilities are often optional, except for Free Action and See Invisible which you will want by DL20 if possible. Hold Life starts to become desirable around DL35 or so. You can play without it, but it's just to darn annoying!

Also note that resistances stack. If two items grant fire resistance, your percentage resistance goes up (but not linearly). Multiple sources of a given resistance also help to prevent many of the nasty side effects for various damage types.

OK, I cannot help thinking that the starting character sheet is lame, since every single attribute is empty. Here is a more interesting sample from a Dragon character I am playing (Notice the different body type? He is playing in <color:r>Monster</color> mode where you get to play as a monster rather than a normal player):

Notice how the resistances stack, as well as how I have most of the resistances covered? This character is almost ready to face The Serpent of Chaos!

<topic:OnMagicalItems><style:heading>On Important Magical Items</style>

Magical Items are an important part of every players repertoire, even the warrior's. There are seveal types of magic that every player needs.

  <indent><color:B>Teleporation and Escape</color>

It is very easy to become surrounded, or cut off from a safe retreat. Even the mightiest of warriors can become overwhelmed by sheer numbers. And this doesn't even account for the fact that many monsters can summon other monsters who can themselves summon other monster summoning monsters. Things can go bad in a heart beat, and when it does, you'll want to have a magical means of escape at the ready.

<color:r>Phase Door</color>     <indent>This is a short range teleport that usually won't get you out of danger. It is useful for distance damage tactics such as the Shoot 'n Scoot maneuver discussed below.</indent>

<color:r>Teleport</color>       <indent>A longer range escape that is the mainstay of most retreats. However, this escape is a bit risky as you may land in a worse situation than you started in.</indent>

<color:r>Teleport Away</color>  <indent>This teleports all monsters in a line away, but many monsters resist and some are immune. It is generally useful for getting rid of a single troublesome opponent while preserving your current position. It is also essential for attempting to clear treasure vaults.</indent>

<color:r>Teleport Level</color> <indent>This is the safest escape, moving you up or down an entire dungeon level. You abandon the current level and all of its goodies, although sometimes you can find your way back through the new level's staircases.</indent>

<color:r>Destruction</color>    <indent>This powerful spell removes everything (including artifacts!) from the area around you, blasting the surroundings and causing rock to fall from the ceiling. If you're ever in deep trouble, this is a good way to escape. However, even Destruction isn't foolproof: monsters get a saving throw and can avoid being removed. I recommend saving scrolls of destruction for the final battle. You will need plenty to deal with all of the Serpent's summons.</indent>
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Healing and Recovery</color>

During your adventures, things will hurt you. This cannot be avoided. Fortunately, there are many magical potions that cure your wounds as well as various status ailments like blindness, confusion and poison.

<color:r>Cure Light Wounds</color>    <indent>Restores a small amount of hitpoints, perhaps 10 or so. And while it won't completely cure cuts, it does reduce their effects (Cuts cause you to bleed out, losing hitpoints every few turns). It also cures blindness which is important since you need to be able to see in order to read a scroll or cast a spell from your spellbook (Not to mention see who is attacking you!).</indent>

<color:r>Cure Serious Wounds</color>  <indent>Restores a bit more hp, perhaps 20 or so. It also cures blindness and confusion and reduces your cut status.</indent>

<color:r>Cure Critical Wounds</color> <indent>Even better! It heals about 30 hp and cures most ailments: blindness, confusion, cuts and stuns are completely cured. So is poison.</indent>

The above three are readily available in the town at the Temple, and you should stock up on them as much as possible. The following must be found in the dungeon or purchased in the Black Market:

<color:r>Curing</color>    <indent>Like Cure Critical Wounds, only better. It heals around 50hp and cures every status ailment excluding Fear. Even Hallucination is cured which is often very welcome as the mere sight of certain monsters is enough to trigger this crippling effect.</indent>

<color:r>Healing</color>   <indent>Big time hp recovery at about 300hp. Also, most status ailments are cured except for fear and hallucination.</indent>

<color:r>*Healing*</color> <indent>Bigger time hp recovery at about 1000hp. Also, most status ailments are cured except for fear and hallucination. These potions are very rare and should be saved for the final two battles.</indent>

<color:r>Life</color>      <indent>Restores your stats, all your hp and removes all status ailments except Fear. These potions are so rare, they should be saved for the final battle.</indent>
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Knowledge</color>

When you find a new object, you generally won't know anything about it. In order to learn about the objects you find, you need some means of knowledge. Every player has an innate sense about some of the objects they find and simply carrying the object around in your pack for a while can give you a clue as to its worth. This ability is called pseudo-id and is discussed elsewhere in the documentation. In general, it only works on equipment such as weapons and armor, although certain classes like Mages can sense the worth of rings and amulets. I mention pseudo-id since it is your most important means of knowledge in the early game. You can also learn what some objects are by trying them out. For example, you can eat a newly found mushroom, or quaff that new potion in your pack. However, if you try this, you'll quickly learn it is a bad idea for mushrooms and potions. For magical devices like wands, rods and staves, it is acceptable to try them as you find them. But once you have Identify, you'll want to use that instead.

Later on, you'll want to improve your means of knowledge and there are two steps in this process (after pseudo-id). The first is called Identify and the second is called *Identify*. The first gives cursory knowledge of an object, revealing its full name and magical combat bonuses or AC bonuses. For potions and scrolls it reveals the name of the object which is often enough for you to tell whether or not it is useful (And once you learn a given flavor of potion, scroll or mushroom, you will automatically recognize the next one you find. So identifying 'flavors' is important in the early game. By the way, you can also sell an object to *Identify* it, but then you won't have it anymore! Still, it's something to consider for the early game when most stuff is junk anyway). The second means of enhanced knowledge, *Identify*, gives complete information about the object, including all of its powers and resistances, many of which won't be learned by simply Identifying the object. Both Identify and *Identify* are available in scroll and device form. Both are also available as a town service (for a price). In general, you'll want to carry lots of Identify to weed out the junk while exploring the dungeon. Once you return to town, you can then pay to *Identify* whatever needs it.

In addition to Identifying objects, you also need to map the dungeon, detect traps, detect monsters and learn about unfamiliar monsters, especially uniques. There are magic items for all of these, so be on the lookout!
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Travel</color>

Finally, you don't need to climb up and down the stairs all the time to return to town. There is a magic tile called a <color:keyword>Wizard Tile</color> that is often generated on levels in a special room. Stepping on the tile will return you to the surface. Similar tiles exist in most of the surface towns allowing you to travel back to the depths to continue your quest. There is also a spell called <color:keyword>Word of Recall</color> that will have the same effect, except that you can cast it whenever you like without having to find the special <color:keyword>Wizard Tile</color>.

<topic:OnWeapons><style:heading>On Weapons, Armor and Slays</style>

Potions, Scrolls and devices are not the only magical items around. You can also find magical armor and equipment. We already discussed resistances above, and magical equipment is the usual place to find these attributes. Magical weapons often are more deadly against certain enemies, an attribute known as slays.

Your equipment will always carry around little numbers that tell you how effective it is. Armors take this form:

  A Robe (+x,+y) [a,+b] (+c)

Weapons take this form:

  A Long Sword (XdY) (+x,+y) [+b] (+c)

When unidentified, armors will show just this:

  A Robe [a]

Weapons will show this:

  A Long Sword (XdY)

What do all these numbers mean?

<color:B>(+x,+y)</color> <indent>This is the item's magical bonuses to your to-hit and to-damage bonus respectively. These are added to whatever other bonuses you have when you attack. Some armors have similar bonuses to your to-hit and to-damage, but they are mostly artifacts, the exceptions being Gloves/Gauntlets/Cesti of Slaying. Many body armors have a small negative number before the base armor bonus (see below); this is a penalty to your skill (the armor is so heavy that you have trouble moving around in it). However, this penalty is small enough for all but the youngest of characters to ignore.</indent>

<color:B>[a,+b]</color>  <indent>This is the item's base armor class and magical bonus to armor. The higher, the better. While theoretically, a weapon could provide a base armor bonus, none of them do, and only a few weapons have a magical bonus to armor.</indent>

<color:B>(+c)</color>    <indent>This is the item's magical bonus to other statistics (and is sometimes referred to as its <color:keyword>pval</color>). Possibilities include one or more of your stats (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma), your speed or your stealth. Your searching or infravision might also be improved. There are other possibilities and learning the effects of this bonus often requires you to *Identify* the object.</indent>

<color:B>(XdY)</color>   <indent>This is the damage dice of a melee weapon. When you hit an opponent, the game rolls a Y sided die X times to figure out a base damage. This base damage can be multiplied by any slays on the weapon, and also by critical hits (lucky blows on your part). Then, the game adds all the plusses to damage to the total, including the +y from the (+x,+y) discussed above. So a melee weapon can be good because it has good damage dice (e.g. (6d5) (+0,+0)) or because it has a high damage bonus (e.g. (1d4) (+5,+30)). Ideally, it would have both: (6d5) (+5,+30)!</indent>

In addition to these attributes, all of which are revealed by Identify, weapons and armors may have additional bonuses. Both may grant a particular resistance that we discussed earlier. In additions, weapons often have slays that target a specific class of monster. Slays work by multiplying the base damage roll (The (XdY) just discussed), and the multiplier varies with the type of slay. For example, a weapon of Slay Orc multiplies the damage dice by a factor of 3, while a *Slay Orc* weapon might (I say, might!) multiply by as high a factor as 5. Obviously, this means more on a (6d5) weapon than on a (1d4) weapon, so the quality of a magical weapon depends heavily on the base type of the object (Daggers do 1d4 while Blades of Chaos do 6d5). You sometimes need to *Identify* a weapon to learn its slays. But sometimes it is obvious from the name of the object (Slay Orc) and you only need to Identify the weapon. Artifacts always required *Identify* to learn their attributes.

<topic:OnExploration><style:heading>On Dungeon Exploration</style>

We'll close this Newbie guide with some various tips on exploring the dungeon.

  <indent><color:B>On Secret Doors</color>

Throughout the dungeon, many doors are hidden from view. To find them, use the (S)earch command, which toggles on and off the Searching mode. However, it is often difficult enough just knowing where to search. Usually, situations like this will have secret doors (walls containing secret doors are marked by *s):
 
#*###  ###'###  ####*#    ###*###
*@...  ..'@'..  ..@'.*    ..'@...
#*###  ###*###  ####'#    #######
 
In general, if you see a door by itself in a corridor, there are usually others nearby. If you find a corner in a corridor with two doors, look for more. Intersections often have some secret doors. Finally, secret doors will never be in a situation where you have to move diagonally to open them. The dead-end situation (the first one) usually does have a secret door, but not always. If you search for a while and don't find anything, just give up and move on. Sometimes a dead end will occur near the end of a map, where there is no room to have a continuing corridor, and so no secret door is generated.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>On Level Feelings</color>

After you have been on a new level for a considerable length of time, you receive a feeling giving you a vague idea how good the level is. In general, the more scary the feeling sounds, the better the items on the level, or the more difficult the monsters. Probably the latter. Each unusual item or monster bumps up the rating of the level a bit. An item or monster is considered unusual if it is out of depth [normally occurs at a lower depth; for instance, a Longsword has a base level of 20, and would be considered unusual anywhere above that level (although not below it)]. Items can be out of depth without necessarily being anything special; a normal, non-magical katana could provoke a high level feeling at low depths, because it is so unusual. Also, pits (large rooms filled with a single type of monster) and vaults (dense, dangerous rooms with many out of depth monsters and items) can cause high level feelings. There is also a Special feeling which tells the player that there is an artifact on the level.

The speed at which you receive level feelings is influenced by your Wisdom, so if your big, stupid warrior seems to wait forever for level feeling, check out his Wisdom and maybe roll up a better one next time.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>On the Monster Memory</color>

In many other games, you are required to take notes on monster's weaknesses, strengths, spells, etc. However, we are not so cruel as that, and will automatically take notes for you with the handy Monster Memory. Every time you find out something new about a monster, like that it can breathe fire, this is added to your knowledge of the monster. To look over this knowledge, type /, then the symbol of the monster. You may have to scroll through other monster memories to get to the one you're looking for. Or use the look ('l') and recall ('r') commands the next time you see one.

In the unpleasant event of your character's death, you can create a new character using your old character's file (instead of simply creating a new character, open the dead character's savefile, and the Creating a Character section will come up). This new character will have all of the old one's monster memories, and some special text for the monster that killed him.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>On Death</color>

Death in PosChengband is permanent. Saving is meant only to let you pick up where you left off; if you die, your savefile is marked. The next time you try to use the savefile, you will get the new character dialogue. Ancestors of dead characters will retain their monster memory and preferences. Many people here have characters like "Yuppy XIV"; people die very often and death is common, so don't get discouraged. In general, you will kill monsters more often than they kill you!
</indent>
<topic:OnBigBoyPants><style:heading>On Big Boy Pants</style>

When you are ready to move past Beginner Mode, the game will open up a huge variety of race and class options for you as well as giving you a full wilderness to explore. All of this is discussed in the remainder of the help system, so when you are ready to move on, be sure to check out the rest of the documentation. Pay special attention to sections on the wilderness as well as the various gameplay options. And when you're ready for a real treat, fire up a game in Monster Mode and play as a Cyberdemon!
