<style:title>The Towns and Wilderness</style>

After you have created your character, you will begin your adventure in a town called <color:keyword>Outpost</color>. If you are playing in Beginner Mode, or another mode that switches off the wilderness, this is the only town in the game; if not, you will find many other towns in the wide world.

Symbols appearing on your screen represent the buildings, streets, shop entrances, terrain, and townspeople. In order to direct your character through his adventure, you will enter single-character commands (see <link:command.txt>).

<topic:MapSymbols><style:heading>Town and Wilderness Symbols</style>

The symbols on your map can be broken down into three broad categories: terrain features; objects which can be picked up; and creatures both friendly and hostile. Listed below are some of the terrain symbols you are likely to see often in the town and the wilderness:

<topic:TownLevel><style:heading>What to Expect in a Town</style>

The exact appearance of Outpost depends on whether you are playing with the wilderness on or off, but the basics are the same either way: you will find a number of shops where items can be bought and sold, plus a handful of other buildings where items are not on display but services or interesting quests might be offered instead. As a general rule, the symbols for shop entrances are usually numerical (such as <$:FF_ALCHEMY_SHOP> for the Alchemy Shop), while buildings that offer services or quests are denoted with the character <$:FF_BUILDING_1> in various colors. Outside these rules are your home <$:FF_HOME> and the museum <$:FF_MUSEUM>, which are not shops but also do not offer quests or services.

A glimpse of Outpost as it appears with the wilderness on can be seen below:

Outpost
</style>

The <color:v>></color> to the east is a dungeon entrance, and is actually where you start the game, but it is not a good idea to enter the dungeon immediately! Do some shopping first, maybe even complete a couple of town quests. The @ symbol marks the player's location; and directly to the player's southeast is the entrance to the White Horse Inn, one of two buildings in this wilderness-on version of Outpost to offer quests. The other one is also visible here - that large multi-entrance building to the northwest, which is the castle of Uldrik, the Count of Outpost. Visit these two buildings, press <color:keypress>q</color> to request your first quests, and decide if you're brave enough to take them on immediately.

A few of the town's shops are also visible here, as well as your home <color:y>8</color>. Additional shops not visible in this shot can be found to the west, including the <color:keyword>General Store</color>, the <color:keyword>Temple Shop</color> and the <color:keyword>Alchemy Shop</color>. These are three shops you should visit at the beginning of every new game, as they sell very useful items you will need on your adventures.

The first time you are in town it will be daytime (unless you are playing an undead race who starts at night), but note that the sun rises and falls as time passes; if you enter the town at night, the town will be dark. Fortunately for you, the various shops and the other special buildings are open on a 24-hour basis.

<topic:Townspeople><style:heading>Townspeople</style>

The shopkeepers are not the town's only inhabitants - you will likely also see some people on the streets. There are the street urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for money, and seem to come out of the woodwork when excited. Blubbering idiots are a constant annoyance, but not harmful. Public drunks wander about the town singing, and are of no threat to anyone. Sneaky rogues who work for the black market are always greedily eyeing your backpack for potential new 'purchases'... And what town would be complete without a swarm of half drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just for the fun of it? Finally, stories told in hushed tones on dark nights speak of the mythical Nick, the butcher; although whether he really is a bloodthirsty destroyer of worlds remains for you to determine.

These townspeople are in fact some of the first <color:keyword>monsters</color> you will meet during your adventure, and some of them should be avoided by the largest possible distance as you wander from store to store. Fights will break out, though, so be prepared. Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue, no experience is awarded for killing the town inhabitants, though you may acquire treasure.

One word of warning: occasionally a creature who normally would inhabit only the wilderness and dungeons may wander into the town. These should generally be handled with much more caution than ordinary townspeople. But they do give experience, so there's that!

<topic:Shopping><style:heading>Shopping in Town</style>

Your character will begin his adventure with a few basic items, plus some gold with which to purchase additional supplies. Just pick the store you wish to visit and walk over to the entrance, and you can shop to your heart's content (or until you run out of money, whichever comes first). See <link:context_shop.txt> for the shopping interface help.

Stores do not always have everything in stock. As the game progresses, stores acquire new items, so check again from time to time to see if they've got something new you might like. But the opposite also happens - items get sold to other customers, often just when you had finally acquired enough money to buy them with. To prevent this from happening, you can <color:keyword>reserve</color> an item you have your eyes on but can't quite afford; but reserving is itself quite expensive, so be sure you really do want that item.

Note that new store inventory will not be added while you are in town, even if you save the game and return. You must spend time in the dungeon and do some adventuring if you wish the store owner to clear out his stock and acquire new items. If you have a lot of spare gold, you can either pay the shopkeeper to restock (this is called <color:keyword>shop shuffling</color>) or simply buy out the store's entire inventory; a buyout will induce the store owner to bring out new stock, though occasionally he might just retire on your money and sell the shop to a new owner.

Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items. If an object is unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it. Having bought an object, they will immediately fully identify it. If it is a good object, they will add it to their inventory; if it was a bad bargain, they simply throw the item away. In either case, you will receive some knowledge of the item that will help you identify similar objects in the future. That's cold comfort if it turns out you sold a great item for a pittance, but does mean the benefits of selling are not purely monetary. Players who turn on the <color:keyword>no selling</color> birth option (<link:option.txt#no_selling>) sometimes "sell" an item for nothing just to have it fully identified.

<topic:ObjectPricing><style:heading>Object Pricing</style>

Each object has a nominal base value, sometimes called the <color:keyword>item score</color>, which is computed based on the quality of the object. Item score is the most important factor in determining the price for which the object can be bought and sold. <color:keypress>I</color>nspecting an inventory item (or e<color:keypress>x</color>amining a shop item) will display its score, though if the item has not yet been fully identified, the score shown may be an inaccurate estimate.

You cannot just buy and sell items for this nominal value, though; shopkeepers will charge you extra when you buy, and pay you less when you sell. How bad this effect is depends on several factors: your charisma, fame, and race, and the shopkeeper's race and greediness. Each shopkeeper also has an individual <color:keyword>selling cap</color>: the maximum amount they will ever pay for a single item.

Shopkeepers like charismatic players, and will pay them more and charge them less. Famous players are also treated favorably in the towns; but new adventurers are a dime a dozen, and make ready marks for store owners. The average shopkeeper has little respect for pretentious, know-it-all upstarts who think they can just buy a lantern and go kill Morgoth. Pshaw!

Your race, and the shopkeeper's race, also affect pricing. Your race can make shopkeepers less friendly, even if you have high charisma (shopkeepers are quite distressed whenever a Balrog enters their shop!), and can affect pricing significantly. The shopkeeper's race is not as important, but it helps a bit if you and the shopkeeper belong to the same race.

The final factor affecting pricing is the shopkeeper's greediness, which is not explicitly displayed but can be inferred from the results. Black Market operators are all extremely greedy and tend to set extortionate prices.

<topic:TheShops><style:heading>List of Shops</style>

  <indent><color:B>The General Store</color> (<$:FF_GENERAL_STORE>)
The General Store sells foods, drinks, some clothing, torches, lamps, oil, shovels, picks, capture balls, and iron spikes. All of these items and some others can be sold back to the General store for money.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>The Museum</color> (<$:FF_MUSEUM>)
This is a place where you can donate objects, which will then be put on permanent display. There is no gameplay advantage to using the Museum; it is simply for storing memories. See <link:context_home.txt#Museum> for more information.</indent>

<topic:Buildings><style:heading>Special Buildings</style>

In addition to the shops, all towns have some special buildings with custom services. The buildings vary from town to town significantly, both in terms of their name and the services that they offer, but a few of the most common or important ones are listed below:

  <indent><color:B>Inns</color> (<$:FF_BUILDING_0>)

Inns are places where the player may obtain food, rest for the night, relax and listen to the latest rumours, and (within limitations - see <link:town.txt#TownTravel> below) teleport to other inns. The inns in Outpost and Lite-Town offer quests. Almost all towns have an inn.

<color:B>Castles</color> (<$:FF_BUILDING_1>)

Nearly all towns have a building, usually a large and conspicuous one, where the local ruler can be found. All rulers have some quests for you to complete; Uldrik, the Count of Outpost, is also willing to identify your items (for a reasonable fee, of course).

<color:B>Libraries</color> (<$:FF_BUILDING_3>)

Librarians are experts in all kinds of lore, and will identify or *Identify* your items in return for payment. The library in Lite-Town also researches monsters, a function more commonly left for the local Beastmaster.

<color:B>Temples</color> (<$:FF_BUILDING_9>)

Many towns have a holy temple, usually connected to or in the immediate vicinity of the Temple Shop. Temples provide healing and restoration (as long as you pay offerings).

<color:B>Arena</color> (<$:FF_BUILDING_2>)

There is only one Arena in the game (in either Thalos or Lite-Town). The Arena is a special building where you may fight a single monster at a time, for the entertainment of the townsfolk. During these fights, you cannot use magical devices, read scrolls, quaff potions, activate equipment or (usually) summon help. Winning an Arena fight increases your fame (some enemies also drop fixed valuable items); but losing a fight severely damages your fame and results in a ban from further Arena fights. You cannot physically die in the Arena; you will exit at 0 HP, with cuts and poisoning healed. Do be careful not to die just outside the Arena, though...

<color:B>Gambling Dens</color> (<$:FF_BUILDING_6>)

Casinos that may offer varied entertainment such as card games or even betting on fights between monsters.

<color:B>Fighters' Halls</color> (<$:FF_BUILDING_7>)

These buildings usually house a weaponsmith who is willing to enchant your equipment for you... though how much work he's willing to put in depends on your class and character level, and of course on how much you pay. Some Fighters' Halls might also offer quests or reforging (see <link:faq.txt#Reforging>).</indent>

This list is far from exhaustive; there are many other buildings besides, with many services and quests on offer. Explore and find out!

<topic:TownQuests><style:heading>Town Quests</style>

At least one building in each town will offer your character the opportunity to undertake a quest. Such quests typically fall under the following categories: kill all monsters on the quest level (assume this to be the case if nothing else is stated), kill one or more monsters of a certain type (for example, kill Old Man Willow or kill 8 Wargs), or retrieve a certain object and escape from the quest level. Completing town quests is a key part of the game; you may eventually spend almost as much time in town quests as you do in dungeons.

When you request a quest, you will be given a brief description of the quest and your objective, as well as an indication of its danger level. For example, here we have just pressed <color:keypress>q</color> to request a quest from the Sultan of Thalos:

<style:screenshot>
 Sultan Idris (Human)                              Palace

<color:R>The Old Watchtower (Thalos)</color> (<color:U>Level 32</color>): Unfortunately, the citizens of          
Thalos are still not safe. A young boy disappeared last week while out          
on a walk; we found his corpse in the forest a few days later, lifeless         
and sucked dry of blood. The city's lawyers, afraid of being blamed by          
the public, are pressuring me to drive out the vampires who have taken

Most town quests take place on special <color:keyword>town quest levels</color>, which can be accessed from the town or its immediate vicinity. Quest entrances are indicated on the map with the symbol <$:FF_QUEST_ENTER>, and will appear at the top of the <color:keypress>]</color> object list, making them easy to spot. You do not have to take them immediately; feel free to delay the quest until you are confident in your ability to succeed. Press <color:keypress>Ctrl-Q</color> every once in a while to check your quest history, which includes an ordered list of uncompleted quests; this will make sure you won't forget to complete them.

Rarely, you will be assigned a <color:keyword>dungeon quest</color>; instead of a special quest level, these quests occur on normal dungeon levels. See <link:dungeon.txt#FixedQuests> for more information on dungeon quests.

Having completed a quest (of either type), return to the person who assigned you the quest and press <color:keypress>q</color> again; you will get warm thanks and (usually) a nice reward for your good work. You can also then request a new quest! But if you leave a quest level before completing the quest, you have irreparably failed it; your fame is reduced, and you miss out on the reward.

Quest lines are semi-fixed; you will mostly receive the same quests from the same buildings in every game, but there is some randomness in the list of quests. The special town quest levels' layouts are likewise semi-fixed; the terrain is usually the same or mostly the same every game, the objects are usually different or mostly different, and the monsters may or may not be the same depending on the quest. Finally, the rewards are semi-fixed; some are more random than others, and many (though not all) are tailored to the specific needs of your race and class. Having seen a quest before is a large practical advantage, but do not assume everything will be exactly the same.

<style:note>Note: Town quest levels obey a few special rules. In particular, you cannot use Genocide, Mass Genocide, Annihilation, Destruction, Earthquake or Teleport Level inside a quest.</style>

You should also not assume that you can teleport everywhere within a quest level; usually you can, but some quests have secure areas with invisible anti-teleportation fields. You can teleport out of these areas, but not in.

<topic:Wilderness><style:heading>The Wilderness Option</style>

Outside the (relative) safety of Outpost lies a large and diverse wilderness, where many towns and dungeons await you. Unfortunately, it is also home to many dangerous creatures, and the distance between where you are and where you want to go is often vast. It is therefore a good idea to use the scaled <color:keyword>global map</color> (also known as the <color:keyword>overworld</color>) for travelling in the wilderness.

<style:note>The Global Map: Press <color:keypress><</color> to enter the global map for wilderness travel, and <color:keypress>></color> to return to the normal map once you have reached your destination.</style>

As displayed on the global map, the wilderness consists of a 97x62 tile world; each tile corresponds to an area the size of a max-sized dungeon level on the regular map, and contains themed terrain such as forests, mountains or plains. A number of towns exist in various parts of the world, each situated on their own wilderness tile. Two of these towns are visible in the screenshot above: Outpost, where you start (actually that one's hidden by the @, which is us!) and Morivant, represented by the * to the east. Many (too many?) dungeon entrances can also be seen, each represented by the familiar <color:v>></color> symbol. In the top-right corner of the screenshot, northeast of Morivant, you can just see the dread dungeon of <color:keyword>Angband</color>; it is home to the Serpent of Chaos, whom you must kill in order to win the game.

Travelling through the overworld is both faster and safer than using the normal map, but the wilderness is still inhabited and dangerous monsters still lurk in wait. The unwary adventurer might suddenly walk into an ambush, and be forced back onto the normal map; in such a situation, you cannot simply run away by using the <color:keypress><</color> key again, but might try escaping with a scroll of Teleport.

There are several ways to improve your odds against being ambushed. Try to stay on the roads as much as possible; they are not completely safe, but far less dangerous than travelling off the beaten path, and if you do get ambushed there the surroundings will likely not be as deadly. Stealthy characters (and very powerful characters) are less likely to be ambushed. In addition, travelling is safer during the daytime.

You can use the <color:keypress>l</color> look command to see the danger level of a wilderness tile. As the <color:y>L0</color> on the screenshot above shows, Outpost is located on a level 0 tile! Some types of terrain, like lava fields or deep oceans, are almost invariably very dangerous and best avoided until your character is a bit stronger.

<topic:Dungeons><style:heading>Discovering and Entering Dungeons</style>

A few of the dungeons are easy to find and enter - they are accessible from towns. You even start the game on the entrance to one such dungeon, <color:keyword>Warrens</color>. These town dungeons are also some of the least dangerous dungeons, which makes sense - who would build a town or live there if the entrance to Hell was next door? Okay, so that's not too bad a description of the no-wilderness town...

The vast majority of dungeons, though, can only be reached through the wilderness. It is best to travel there through the global map; but dungeons cannot be actually entered from the global map, only from the regular map, so you'll have to switch back as you reach the right tile. As you do this, a problem sometimes becomes apparent: because one tile on the scaled global map corresponds to a fairly large area on the normal map, there is no guarantee you will find yourself immediately next to the actual entrance. The entrance might be some way away, maybe even out of sight (in such a situation the game will helpfully tell you which direction the entrance is in). Take the direction indicated, and use the <color:keypress>]</color> object/feature list command regularly; it will often spot the entrance before its actual appearance on the screen.

There is another obstacle you may encounter before reaching the dungeon. Many dungeons have an <color:keyword>entrance guardian</color> - a monster sitting on top of the entrance who will refuse to budge until you have killed it. Entrance guardians are also immune to being teleported, so that is not an easy way out! Sometimes it is possible to dodge an entrance guardian and reach the stairs despite its watchful eye, but most of the time you will have to kill it. In general, low-level dungeons have no entrance guardians while high-level dungeons do have one; some of them, like the Ethereal Dragon on the Crystal Castle entrance, can be very dangerous.

Occasionally, you will find dungeon entrances in places where you did not expect any. These are random one-level dungeons - they are often dangerous, but can have exceptional items within. Random dungeons sometimes generate quite close to regular dungeons; especially in the deep oceans, where random dungeons are fairly common, you might have to double-check that the entrance you found is actually the one you were looking for. (You can use the <color:keypress>l</color>ook command or the <color:keypress>*</color> targetting command for this.)

Having finally reached the entrance - hopefully the right one - just press <color:keypress>></color> and you're inside. After that, you'll never have to take this particular wilderness trip again: you have automatically established a recall point in the dungeon, and can return there by Word of Recall any time you wish.

See <link:dungeon.txt> for what to expect in the dungeon.

<topic:Visiting><style:heading>Which Dungeons Should I Visit?</style>

There are three main reasons you might wish to visit a dungeon - to complete a quest there, to kill the final guardian (or boss) who inhabits the last level of the dungeon, or simply to gather some experience and loot. The last of these can of course be done in any dungeon, but sometimes you might feel a particular dungeon is just really comfortable for your character and playstyle.

The first time you play, you won't really know who the bosses are (or which depths they inhabit), and you probably haven't received many dungeon quests yet, maybe just the very early Pest Control quest (see <link:dungeon.txt#FixedQuests>). So it is a sensible idea to just do the town dungeons first, and then peek into the others in order of the depth they start at, since that's what <color:keypress>l</color>ooking at a dungeon reveals. For example, after completing <color:keyword>Warrens</color>, <color:keyword>Hideout</color> and the <color:keyword>Icky Cave</color> (and a few town quests), you might wish to enter the <color:keyword>Tidal Cave</color>, <color:keyword>Orc Cave</color>, <color:keyword>Labyrinth</color> and <color:keyword>Camelot</color> next.

The Angband dungeon is a bit special in that it starts at a very low level - level 1 - but the boss (that would be the Serpent of Chaos!) - is all the way down on level 100. Also, Angband uniquely has a number of random quests strewn throughout, often with good rewards for completion. This makes it hard to know when you should enter Angband. Some players go there very early for the quests; others may postpone it for a long time, or even use magical methods to skip most of the dungeon altogether.

Once you have done enough descending into a dungeon, you might be informed you have located the dungeon's boss:

    <indent>You enter a maze of down staircases. <color:y>Mughash the Kobold Lord lives on this level as the keeper of Warrens.</color></indent>

Killing bosses is fun (and rewarding), but it can also be dangerous, especially when you are playing for the first time and don't really know what the bosses do. To improve your knowledge, you can pay your local Beastmaster (most but not all towns have one) to research the boss for you; this will reveal you everything about them, and allows you to prepare and make an informed decision as to whether you are ready to take them on. Pay particular attention to whether the boss resists confusion - some bosses are seemingly very tough for their depth, but if they do not resist confusion, that's an opening for you. Though some of the higher-level bosses (like <color:keyword>Utgard-Loke</color>) seem to shake confusion off suspiciously quickly...

Sometimes you can just jump from dungeon to dungeon, killing the bottom guardians and leaving a trail of universal destruction in your wake. At other times you may have to prepare a bit, in town quests or on the lower levels of dungeons. In the early mid-game, this might happen in <color:keyword>Lonely Mountain</color> - players often find it a good dungeon to set up camp in for a while, since the terrain is usually relatively favorable and the presence of many dragons means that treasures are also abundant. Note though that the Lonely Mountain is, well, a mountain, and very difficult to enter for the first time unless you have <color:keyword>levitation</color>.

The big takeaway here should be that <color:G>there is no single right order to do the dungeons in.</color> Some people like to dive into very deep dungeons really early, and the entrance guardians be damned! Experiment a bit; find out what works for you, which bosses you find easy to handle, and which dungeons you really like. Sometimes you will be completing a whole dungeon in one go; at other times you may be hopping between several dungeons you're halfway into, or repeatedly recalling in and out of a single dungeon with no intention of fighting the boss.

See <link:dungeon.txt#List> for a list of dungeons.

<topic:TownTravel><style:heading>Travelling Between Towns</style>

A network of roads connects most of the towns, providing the best and simplest way to reach them (at least for the first time). Again, use the global map. Stick to the roads as much as you can; sometimes it is tempting to take a shortcut through the wild, but this increases the chance of a dangerous ambush.

As with dungeons, you only need to really take these wilderness trips once. A teleportation grid connects the inns of the towns, and you can use it (for a reasonable fee) to jump from town to town. The tavern keepers, being businessmen, want your money... but they also want their customers alive, and won't send you into another town without knowing you can handle the new environment. But once you have proved this by reaching the town on foot, you can return there by teleport at any time. There is one exception to this rule: the town of <color:keyword>Thalos</color> lies in the middle of a dangerous ocean, and the innkeepers have no wish to lose a customer by sending them there on foot. So, you are allowed to teleport there as soon as you have reached any town besides Outpost. (It is rumoured that one of the towns may have been cut off from the teleportation grid by strange disturbances in the space-time continuum... Perhaps you can do something about that?)

Once you have enough money to afford it comfortably, you will find yourself teleporting between the towns regularly. All have quests to complete, and shops to visit - and somehow, your home has its full inventory in every town, so that's handy!

<topic:NoWilderness><style:heading>The No Wilderness Option</style>

Diverse dungeons are fun, multiple towns are fun, and the wilderness is fun; but sometimes you might want to just forget about them all and select the <color:keyword>No Wilderness</color> option. Maybe you are new to FrogComposband, and want to learn the basics in a simplified version of the game before moving on to the full version. (<color:keyword>Beginner Mode</color> automatically turns on coffee-break mode, which turns off the wilderness - though sometimes, enthusiastic new players jump straight to the Normal Mode!) Or maybe you are a long-term player who has already been everywhere, seen everything, and wants a quicker and more streamlined game experience for a change. Maybe you just really like coffee-break mode.

In no-wilderness play, there is only one town: Outpost. The no-wilderness version of Outpost is somewhat different from the wilderness Outpost and is sometimes referred to as <color:keyword>lite-town</color>, although it actually has a lot more stuff in it than the regular version does. With wilderness on, Outpost is a very basic and simple town; it has the shops, the inn, the castle, but to find exciting special buildings you have to travel elsewhere. This is not the case with Lite-Town - there is no elsewhere to travel, so all the special buildings important to the game (and a few that are not so important) can be found in the single town. The number of quests available in Lite-Town is also much higher than in regular Outpost, though also much lower than in all the wilderness towns combined.

Here's a glimpse of this alternative Outpost - the Count's castle, the inn and most of the other buildings are in the same locations, but there are many additional buildings, and the dungeon entrance is within the walls.

<topic:Coffee><style:heading>Coffee-Break Mode</style>

Coffee-break mode is a <color:keyword>birth option</color> you can select from the <color:keypress>=</color> options menu during character creation. Selecting Beginner Mode at the intro screen automatically turns coffee-break mode on, but coffee-break mode is also available in Normal Mode and in Monster Mode.

Coffee-break mode greatly accelerates experience gain in the dungeon (only the dungeon!), increases monster drops, improves their quality, and speeds up a number of less obvious game mechanics such as reforging and most forms of proficiency gain. Coffee-break mode also makes the game faster in other ways - it reduces early-game level size, turns all staircases into shafts, and disables all upstairs altogether. The only way you can go is <color:keyword>down</color>, and you will find yourself in the thick of the action very quickly! Coffee-break mode (unlike other forms of forced-descent play) does allow you to recall back to town, to shop and to complete town quests; you are also allowed to fail dungeon quests, although this causes you to permanently lose the special accelerated reforging bonus.

It is not possible to use coffee-break mode with the wilderness on. It is possible to play with both the wilderness and coffee-break mode off, but this is not recommended.

<color:B>How to Cope in Coffee-Break Mode</color>

Although coffee-break mode is turned on for beginners, it does not necessarily make the game easy. Sure, your character will gain in power very fast - but you also run into nasty enemies very fast! It is therefore best to have a plan.

One town quest is available to coffee-break players that many characters can complete before entering the dungeon - the <color:keyword>Thieves' Hideout</color> quest, offered by Count Uldrik. Completing this quest nets you several character levels, a reward from the Count, and a fair bit of money; you can now purchase better supplies, as well as request your next quest: <color:keyword>Pest Control</color> (the Warg Quest). This quest is in the dungeon, so you cannot delay going there any further - but killing the Wargs will give you quite a lot of experience, radically improving your chances when you meet the first random questor.

<color:B>Random Questors</color>

Random level guardians are both the greatest peril, and the greatest opportunity, that you will face early in a coffee-break game. Killing a random questor gives you a free stat-up, bonus exceptional items (beyond what they'd drop anyway!), and the warm feeling of making tangible progress.

On the other hand... the random level guardians are all out-of-depth uniques, and even with your accelerated power gain it is far from a given that you can kill them. Occasionally, you get very unlucky and the game hits you with a guardian who is simply way too tough for you. Players have often pulled off miraculous kills in these situations - desperation can come up with a strategy where a calmer mind would give up. But sometimes it is better to just accept your unfortunate fate and purposely fail the quest before you die or burn all your supplies in a futile attempt at completion. The penalties for failing a quest are rough (you can probably already forget your dream of reforging Ringil onto a ring); but at least you are alive.

Because you never know when you might meet a tough guardian, and cannot just recall home to get your supplies like you could in a wilderness game, it is best to be always prepared. Nothing is more annoying than making a heroic attempt at killing the guardian and narrowly failing because you had left one potion too many at home.

See <link:dungeon.txt#RandomQuests> for the basics of how a random dungeon quest works.
