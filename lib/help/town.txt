
====== The Town ======

     You begin your adventures in the town.  It consists of eight buildings,
each with a shop entranceway, and is well populated.  The first time you are in
town it will be daytime, but the sun rises and sets as time passes.

Townspeople:
     Most townsfolk are fairly harmless.  However, there are slippery-fingered
thieves and armed killers that you need to avoid.  Fights will break out,
though, so be prepared.  Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue,
no experience is awarded for killing the town inhabitants, though you may
acquire treasure.


--- Stores ---

     You enter buildings by walking onto their entranceways, which (in text
mode) are represented by numbers from 1 to 9.
     A new display then replaces the old.  You see the name and race of the
store owner, the name of the store, and the maximum number of gold pieces that
the store owner will pay for any one item.  Below it is displayed the inventory;
if it is numerous, you may display another page by typing space.  Near the
bottom of the screen is displayed a list of commonly-used commands.
     - ESC:  leave the store.
     - 'g' or 'p': get/purchase an item.
     - 'd' or 's': drop/sell an item.
     - 'l': look at an item (display any special properties, read spellbooks)
     - 'v': Toggle between store inventory and services

--- Buying and Selling ---

The Price of Items:
     The price of items that change hands depends on their base cost, how well
your and the store owner's races get along*, your Charisma, and the innate
greediness of the store owner.  If you have the "auto_haggle" option set, you
pay an extra 10% when buying, and get 10% less when selling.

     * Everyone likes their own race best
     * Nobody else likes Half-Orcs and Half-Trolls; the feeling is mutual.
     * Elves and Dwarves are not very fond of each other; elves have better
       relations with humans than do dwarves

     If you have the "auto_haggle" option set, you simply pay the going rate.
Otherwise, you haggle for everything that isn't marked as being fixed price.

Haggling:
Note: Most players choose to play with haggling off.

     If you are selling something, a typical haggling session starts with the
shopkeeper assuring you that a good price is maybe 1-25% of what the item is
really worth.  You demand many times this, and the bargaining begins.  You bring
your price closer to the shopkeeper's offer, and he then does the same for you.
The best way to change a price is to enter "-20" or "+20", instead of retyping a
new figure.  After some rounds, you and the shopkeeper will meet somewhere in
the middle.
     The key to success is to change your price neither too little (which will
insult the shopkeeper) nor too much (which is a sign of inexperience, and will
be taken advantage of).  Some shopkeepers like to haggle more, other are
impatient and demand good offers, but you have always have enough leeway to
succeed.
     Just be careful not to antagonize the shopkeepers too much; if you do, you
might be thrown out of the store, which will stay locked for maybe three or four
days.  Fortunately, shopkeepers are forgiving souls:  as time passes, they will
forget any unhappiness you've caused them.  Shopkeepers also forget an insult
every time you buy or sell anything.

Store Stocks:
     Stores never have everything in stock; as time passes, their inventory
slowly changes (but only when you are in the dungeon).  The store owner fully
identifies everything you sell him; you also become aware of objects of that
type.

Shopkeepers can retire and be replaced:
     Shopkeepers do retire, but only rarely.  The new shopkeeper has no
knowledge of your previous reputation, and no memory of any past insults.  He
puts everything in the store on sale.
