<style:title>The Town and Wilderness</style>

The game takes place in one of several worlds, depending on the choice you made during the birth process. For example, if you are playing <color:keyword>The World of Middle Earth</color>, then the game begins in a world called <color:keyword>The Desolation of Smaug</color>. Every world has a goal: a monster you must slay in order to either advance to the next world, or to complete the game. Each world also has a surface wilderness populated with towns and dungeons to explore. You must travel in this world in order to learn the layout, though it might prove beneficial to ask a wizard for help in locating unknown dungeon entrances.

Fortunately, your adventures will begin in the (relative) safety of town where you may equip yourself for the adventures to come. Next to your starting town, there should be an initial dungeon entrance which you can located either with the map display (<color:keypress>M</color>) or with the object list (<color:keypress>]</color>). You will generally want to explore this dungeon initially until your character is powerful enough to survive the dangers of unknown wilderness exploration!

<style:note>There is no longer a global map (<color:keypress><</color>) for wilderness travel. You simply explore the wilderness as you would any other dungeon level.</style>

<topic:MapSymbols><style:heading>Town and Wilderness Symbols</style>

Symbols on your map can be broken down into three categories: terrain features such as walls, floor and doors, and trees, water and lava; objects which can be picked up such as treasure, weapons, magical devices, etc; and creatures which may or may not move about, but are mostly harmful to your character's well being. Symbols specific to the town and wilderness are shown below. Note that many creatures and objects from the dungeon may also appear in town and you should also review the comprehensive listing of all the various symbols which can be found in the dungeon section (see <link:dungeon.txt#MapSymbols>).

<topic:TownLevel><style:heading>The Town Level</style>
<screenshot:town01>
The town level is where you will begin your adventure. The first time you are in town it will be daytime (unless you are playing an undead race who start at night), but note that the sun rises and falls as time passes and if you enter the town at night, the town will be dark. Fortunately, the various shops and the other special buildings are open on a 24-hour basis.

The world includes multiple towns separated by a wilderness and many dungeons as well. Be sure to check the various buildings in each town to see what services are available.

<topic:Wilderness><style:heading>The Wilderness Map</style>

The wilderness requires actual exploration to learn the layout. The following is a sample map from <color:keyword>The World of Amber</color> which I have completely explored:
<screenshot:town02>
This world is randomly generated for each game you play, so the actual map layout will differ from game to game (as will the available dungeons). In <color:keyword>The World of Middle Earth</color> you get a fixed sequence of world maps that do not change from game to game.

The wilderness consists of a moderately sized tile world. Each tile is the size of a standard dungeon level and contains themed wilderness terrain (mountainous areas, oceans, plains, etc). There are several towns located in various parts of the world and each town is situated in its own wilderness square. In addition, there are numerous dungeon entrances in the wilderness. Again, each is located on its own wilderness square.

The wilderness is not uninhabited and can be dangerous for the unwary. As a general rule, the further your character gets from civilization the more cautious he or she should be. When traveling between towns, try to stay on the roads. These are by no means safe, but they are safer than wandering off the beaten path. In addition, traveling is safer during the daytime.

Each of the towns contains the standard nine shops where you can purchase your supplies for your trips into the dungeon and sell the items you have collected. There are also special buildings offering services for a fee. The services available and the prices charged may vary from town to town so it can be worth hunting around for the best prices.

<topic:Townspeople><style:heading>Townspeople</style>

The town contains many different kinds of people. There are the street urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for money, and seem to come out of the woodwork when excited. Blubbering idiots are a constant annoyance, but not harmful. Public drunks wander about the town singing, and are of no threat to anyone. Sneaky rogues who work for the black market are always greedily eyeing your backpack for potential new 'purchases'... And what town would be complete without a swarm of half drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just for the fun of it? Finally, towns are no longer completely safe. Monsters can wander in from the wild, of course (e.g. an Orc raiding party may rampage through town). In addition, you will see many types of men and elves in towns, and they are not always friendly. A difficult town may be populated with sorcerers and arch-priests!

<topic:Shopping><style:heading>Shopping in Town</style>

Your character will begin his adventure with some basic supplies, and some extra gold with which to purchase more supplies at the town stores. You may enter any open store and barter with the owner for items you can afford by simply moving onto the entrance, which is represented by a number from 1 to 9.

Shopping has been re-written for version 6.0.0. Please see <link:context_shop.txt> for up to date help about shopping commands.

Stores do not always have everything in stock. As the game progresses, they may get new items so check from time to time. Also, if you sell them an item, it may get sold to a customer while you are adventuring, so don't always expect to be able to get back everything you have sold.

Note that new store inventory will not be added while you are in town, even if you save the game and return (However, items you just sold may be resold at any time. In fact, there seems to be an insatiable demand for quality items, and they can get resold rather quickly!). You must spend time in the dungeon if you wish the store owner to clear out his stock and acquire new items. If you have a lot of spare gold, you can purchase every item in a store, which will induce the store owner to bring out new stock, and perhaps even retire.

Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items. If an object is unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it. Once they have bought it they will immediately identify the object. If it is a good object, they will add it to their inventory. If it was a bad bargain, they simply throw the item away. In any case, you may receive some knowledge of the item if another is encountered.

<topic:ObjectPricing><style:heading>Object Pricing</style>

Each store owner has three primary attributes: the maximum amount they will pay for an object, their race and how greedy they are. Each of these affects how much a store owner will charge for an object and how much they are prepared to pay for something. Only the first two attributes can be known by the player. The final factors affecting pricing are the race, charisma and notoriety of the player.

Each object has a base value which is computed based on the quality of the object. This base value is modified depending on the store owner's greed (greedy store owners charge more and will pay less), your charisma (charismatic players pay less and can charge more) and whether or not the shopkeeper is friendly to your race (Shopkeepers are quite distressed whenever a Balrog enters their shop!). Also, famous players are treated favorably in the towns, but new adventurers are a dime a dozen and make ready marks for greedy store owners. Frankly, the shopkeepers have had enough of pretentious, know-it-all, upstarts who think they can just buy a lantern and go kill Morgoth. Pshaw!

Finally, when selling objects, the cap on the store owner's purse is applied so that even a favored race with a high charisma can not sell an item for more than that amount. This cap applies only to single items so it is possible to sell a stack of similar items for more than the cap on the store owner's purse.

<topic:Buildings><style:heading>Special Buildings</style>

In addition to the shops, the town will have special buildings with custom services. The buildings vary from town to town significantly both in terms of their name and the services they offer. Each town contains an Inn where the player may obtain food (assuming food does them any good) and rest for the night. Other buildings might include libraries where you can research objects and monsters, guilds for the various classes and magic realms, temples, healers and more. Note that some buildings such as guilds may offer preferential prices to members of their guild or offer services which are only available to their guild. Some building owners may offer preferential treatment to their own race or to a group of races.
