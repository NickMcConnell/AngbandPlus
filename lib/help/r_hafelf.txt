#####GDescription
Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than humans, but not as strong. 
Half-elves are slightly better at searching, disarming, saving throws, 
stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons. Half-
elves may choose any class and do not receive any intrinsic abilities.
