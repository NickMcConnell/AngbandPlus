This file is meant to be a very quick summary of the major features of
the interface. Make sure you read "The Mouse" section at least.

<H1>Game Windows</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Note: Currently the game recognizes two screen sizes: (1) width
    greater or equal to 800, and (2) anything less than 800. Some of
    the windows support dynamic resizing and some don't. If you want
    to move the windows around, be sure to choose the "Save Window
    Positions" option from the "Window" menu.
<P>
    Note: In general, clicking the close box on a window has the same
    effect as typing Escape. Windows that shouldn't be closed in this
    way just beep at you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Message Window</H3>

The Message Window displays messages to you. You can click the Message
Window once to display the previous message. Double-click it to see a
list of previous messages. If the "-more-" prompt is displayed then
clicking clears the prompt.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Note: The Message Window is used throughout the game. You should
    ensure that it does not become obscurred or you may get confused.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Main Window</H3>

The Main Window displays the cave, status messages, the Monster Health Bar,
player depth, and an information line. Click the depth display to toggle
the "depth_in_feet" option. The "Map (M)" command displays a small-scale
map in the Main Window, with scroll bars. Pointing to a location in the
dungeon map shows what is at that location, displaying the surrounding
grids in the Micro Map Window. Click the dungeon map to hide it again.
Right-Click the dungeon map to bring up a popup menu that allows you to
change the map's scale. Click-drag to scroll the map. Click the "C" in the
status bar to recenter the display at the character location.
<P>
<H3>Micro Map Window</H3>

The Micro Map Window displays a miniature version of the cave. Pointing
to a location displays (in the Main Window) what is at that location, and
displays a description of the location, as is done in the Main Window.
Click the Micro Map Window to display the full cave map. Right-Click the
Micro Map Window to bring up a popup menu of resolutions. Click-drag to
scroll the map. Shift-click to fix the Main Window at the location.
<P>
<H3>Inventory Window</H3>

The Inventory Window displays the inventory and equipment your character
has. When the game is asking you to choose an item, simply double-click
the item to choose it. When an item is highlighted, the item memory is
displayed in the Recall Window. Right-click on an item to pop up a
menu of commands. To change some options related to the display of
the inventory, click the down-arrow button in the toolbar.
<P>
<H3>Recall Window</H3>

The Recall Window displays your character's memory about artifacts,
monsters and objects. When the game is asking the user to select
something, such as an inventory item or spell, a list of choices is
displayed. When the pointer is over a row it is highlighted:
click the item or spell to choose it. When the pointer is inside the
Recall Window, the window automatically grows to reveal all of its content.
When the pointer leaves the Recall Window, the window shrinks back to its
regular size. When the Choice Window is visible, then all choices are
displayed in the Choice Window instead.
<P>
<H3>Misc Window</H3>

The Misc Window displays a few of the more important attributes for
your character. Click the character icon to see the Character
Window. The 9 buttons at the top of the Misc Window give you quick
access to various functions. Click the "EXP" label to toggle between
total experience points and points needed to advance. Click the "AC"
label to toggle between total armor class and base,bonus. Right-click
to pop up a menu to choose Text Labels versus graphical labels.
<P>
<H3>Character Window</H3>
The Character Window displays information about the character. Menu
commands allow the user to change the character icon, character name,
and to write a character record to a text file.

<H3>Character Window (Flags)</H3>

The Flags page of the Character Window displays a table of properties
affecting the current character. 
Along the top of the table is one icon for each
equipment item and one icon for the character. Each row in the
table displays, under each icon, what properties the item gives
the character, or what the character's intrinsic abilities are.
Pointing to one of the icons displays a description of the item,
(or the character's name, race and class) and the item memory is
displayed in the Recall Window.
<P>
<H3>Book Window</H3>

The Book Window shows the spells in a given book. You can double-click a
spell to select it when prompted.
<P>
<H3>Store Window</H3>

When the game is waiting for a command, double-click an item to initiate
a purchase (or take an item in the Home). Or, when the game is asking you to
select an item to purchase double-click one. When an item is selected the
memory is displayed in the Recall Window, and the quantity field is reset
to 1. To buy a number of items, type in a number type ENTER.
<P>
<H3>Options Window</H3>

The options window allows you to change the multitude of options
available to you. There are a couple of slider controls, but most of the
options are boolean on/off options that you can toggle by clicking the
checkbox beside the description of each option. Options from the non-Tk
version of the game can be displayed, but these options have no effect.

<H3>Knowledge Window</H3>

The "Knowledge (~)" command brings up this window. On the left is a list
of groups of related monsters. Click a group to see a list of monsters
in that group. Click a monster on the right and the monster memory is
displayed. The menu allows you to see groups of artifacts as well. You can
search for known artifacts and monsters by name.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>Macros Window</H3>

The Macros Window displays a list of all currently defined macros. On the
left is a string representing the trigger keypress. On the right is
the associated action for the macro.
<P>
Type 'n' to create a new macro. Point the mouse over the Trigger Entry
and then type a new keypress to invoke the selected macro.
<P>
Type an encoded action into the Action Entry and hit Enter. Keep in mind the
following representations:
<PRE>
    \e -- Escape
    \s -- Space
    \\ -- Backslash
</PRE>
Macros are not the same as in the original Angband. They use X Windows
symbols for keypress names, which are human-readable. This means most of your
old macros won't work with AngbandTk.
<P>
You can read an existing preferences file by choosing "Load Pref File" from
the menu. You can append all the currently defined macros to a new or
exising file by choosing "Dump Macros" from the menu. Even though the
system asks you to confirm replacing an existing file, the macros are
actually appended to the file you choose.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>Keymap Window</H3>

The Keymap Window displays a keyboard and shows you which keys have
keymaps assigned to them. A keymap is just like a macro only it applies
to "normal" keys. Click the left mouse button in the displayed keyboard
to select a key, enter an action in the Action entry, and hit Enter.
Entering an empty string deletes the keymap for the selected key.
<P>
<H3>Progress Window</H3>

The Progress Window displays the character's hitpoints (HP), spell points
(also called mana) (SP), and food level (FD). The appearance of the window
can be changed using a context menu (right-click to access the menu).
<P>
<H3>Choice Window</H3>

The Choice Window displays a list of choices whenever the game is asking
the user to select something, such as an inventory item or spell. A single
click chooses the item or spell. When the game is not asking the user to
choose, the character's
inventory or equipment is displayed (type / to toggle). A context menu of
actions is available by right-clicking in a row. The default action is
invoked by double-clicking an item. The Choice Window can be
closed by clicking the close box in the title bar, and can be shown by
selecting the menu entry in the Window Menu. When the Choice Window is
not visible, then all choices are displayed in the Recall Window instead.
Clicking outside any item pops up a menu of options which control the
appearance and behaviour of the Choice Window.
<P>
<H3>Messages Window</H3>

The Messages Window displays the most recent messages. The Messages Window
can be closed by clicking the close box in the title bar, and can be
displayed by selecting the menu entry in the Window Menu.

<A NAME="the-mouse"></A>
<H1>The Mouse</H1>

These notes apply to mouse events in the Main Window.
<P>
1. Click the left mouse button (ButtonPress-1) to move the character
one step in the corresponding direction. Pressing and holding the
left mouse button moves the character continuously, but is not the
same as running (see below).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Note: No game turns are consumed by moving the character
    into a wall or on-the-spot, except for the initial mouse click.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Click the right mouse button (ButtonPress-3) to make the character
run in the corresponding direction. Alternatively, shift-click the
left mouse button (Shift-ButtonPress-1) to make the character run.
<P>
3. Control-click the left mouse button (Control-ButtonPress-1) to invoke
the "Alter (+)" command. See "commands.txt" for what that does.
<P>
4. Simply pointing the cursor at a given cave location provides a
description of what is seen, similar to the "Look (l)" command. When
the cursor is over a visible monster, the monster health bar is shown
and monster memory is displayed.
<P>
5. When the game is asking you to choose an inventory item, press the
right mouse button (ButtonPress-3) and a popup menu pops up. Select an
item from this menu to choose it; otherwise type ESACPE twice. You can
also choose spells to cast and study in this way.
<P>
6. When the game is asking you to enter a direction (as when firing an
arrow or aiming a wand), simply click the mouse in the desired direction.
Or right-click to target the monster or location under the mouse.
<P>
7. When the "-more-" prompt is displayed, and the "quick_messages" option
is set, click the mouse to skip past the message. It also works if the
mouse button is held down (as when fighting a monster).
<P>
8. When a repeated command is in progress (running, resting, tunneling,
etc), simply click the left mouse button (ButtonPress-1) to interrupt
the command.
<P>
9. Control-right-click (Control-ButtonPress-3) pops up a cascading menu
of items in the character's inventory. Seleting an item uses the item.
<P>
10. When the game is asking you to target a monster or location,
left-click to set the target. If a targettable monster
is at the location, it is targetted. Otherwise the location is targetted.
<h1>Performance Issues</h1>
From a fast, portable, terminal-based game to a single-system multimedia
monster, the performance of AngbandTk may leave you wanting more. Here are
some tips for a faster gaming experience.
<ul>
<li>Set your monitor to High Color (16-bit) instead of True Color (24 bit).</li>
<li>Keep the Main Window and Micro Map Window sizes to a minimum.</li>
<li>Play with 32x32 icons instead of 16x16.</li>
<li>Turn off the music.</li>
<li>Close any programs which are running in the background.</li>
<li>Don't assign a sound to the "Walk a step" event.</li>
<li>Buy a faster computer. :-)</li>
</ul>
