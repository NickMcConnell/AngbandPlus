<style:title>The Mogaminator</style>

<color:keyword>The Mogaminator</color> is a rule based system for managing objects automatically. With this system, you can decide which objects to pickup, which to destroy, which to automatically identify, and which to display in the special full screen map. You can automatically inscribe certain objects to suit your tastes (for example, spellbooks or magical devices) and even enter conditional statements to handle the preferences of different classes.

This document describes this system in tutorial fashion, assuming you know nothing about it. Detailed reference material will appear towards the bottom of this document (see <link:editor.txt#Reference> if you really cannot wait!).

<style:note>This system is named after its original author. I got rather tired of calling it the <color:keyword>Automatic Pickup and Destruction Preferences</color>, which is not only a lot to type, but sounds rather stuffy and boring as well. Also, it was sometimes called <color:keyword>The Auto-Destroyer</color>, but, as you are about to learn, automatic destruction is only part of the story.</style>

<topic:Review><style:heading>Review of Object Knowledge</style>
There is no doubt about it: The game generates lots and lots of objects. Some are valuable and some are not. And what you consider worthy will even change based on your character's class and progress. Dealing with objects, especially later in the game, can become a bit of a nuisance. Fortunately, there are ways to handle the mountains of stuff that your character is likely to encounter.

First, let's do a quick review. When you find an object, it will generally be unidentified. You might know the basic kind of object it is (e.g. a sword), and perhaps its damage dice (if it is a weapon) or its base AC (if it is armor), but not much else. Carry the object around a bit in your pack, and you might eventually get a sense of the quality of the object: whether it is good, or excellent or even special, or just average or perhaps even terrible. Details depend on your class and this is called <color:keyword>pseudo-id</color>. See <link:objects.txt#PseudoID> for more information. If you are impatient, you can <color:keyword>identify</color> the object right away, provided you have a means to do so (spell, scroll or magical device). Identification tells you a little more about the object, including its obvious magical bonuses and its ego type or artifact name, should you be so lucky to find an excellent or special item. But Identify generally won't tell you everything about the object. You might need to <color:keyword>*Identify*</color> it as well to learn about all its attributes.

To recap: your knowledge of an object is in one of the following states:
  [1] Unknown
  [2] Pseudo-Identified
  [3] Identified
  [4] *Identified

Since Identify and *Identify* are scarce resources, you will need to excercise some restraint when using them. Actually, Identify is rather common and it is only *Identify* you really need to worry about, at least once you reach the middle part of the game.

For mushrooms, potions and scrolls, things are a little different. These objects come in <color:keyword>flavors</color>, and once you have learned the flavor, you will immediately recognize all future instances of that object. Indeed, all instances of the object are exactly alike, so the identification game is simply to discover and know the first instance of the object, and then decide, via your pickup and destroy preferences, what to do with future instances of this type of object. For these objects, Identify usually suffices.

For excellent objects, you also need to learn about the ego type itself. For example, the first time you encounter a (Pattern) weapon, your character will have no knowledge of its basic attributes. Once you *Identify* an instance of this ego, you become aware of future instances of this ego, just like with flavors of potions and scrolls. This will allow you to cut back on your use of *Identify*, but realize that many ego types also have some random bonuses in addition to their fixed attributes. When you learn an ego type, it is only the fixed attributes that you become aware of.

<topic:ManagingObjects><style:heading>Managing Objects</style>

So, how do you manage this? Well, you can certainly manage things manually, dealing with each object in isolation as you encounter it. For the early game, this is doable. But the first time you <color:keypress>Ctrl+Arrow</color> through a horde orcs or trolls, you will find this approach tedious. At this point, I recommend you bite the bullet and enable <color:keyword>The Mogaminator</color>. It is worth learning about if you plan on playing this variant for any length of time. There is also an <color:keyword>Easy Destroyer</color> approach to managing objects, but I'd prefer you not use it. The choice is yours, though, but one caution: Decide which system you are going to use and only use that system. In other words, if you turn The Mogaminator on, then turn off the Easy Destroyer, and vice versa. If you leave both systems on, then there are precedence issues (one system might destroy what is marked as desirable via the other system) and it can be hard to track down why some undesirable event is happening.

What is <color:keyword>The Mogaminator</color>? Basically, it is a rule based system for taking a given action each time you encounter a certain type of object. The default action is pickup, and this action is used whenever you fail to specify an alternative action. But you will also want to learn about destroying objects too, since much of what you find will be <color:keyword>junk</color>. Let's discuss the basics.

<topic:BasicUsage><style:heading>Basic Usage</style>

In this section, I'll describe using <color:keyword>The Mogaminator</color> without knowing anything at all about it. So, I am assuming you are a new player. Please don't take offense :)

You turn on this system by pressing <color:keypress>_</color>, which also brings up an in-game editor where you can manage your preferences. It might look something like:
<style:screenshot>
<color:B>(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)</color>         (0,10)

Pickup and inscribe "!E" on all items which have "mushroom of restoring" as part

</style>

Since you are new, you probably want to run from this complexity as fast as you can. Notice the top line of the screen where it tells you how to get out: <color:keypress>^Q</color>. That's fine and we'll discuss this file in detail, including its format and what each line means later on below. The important thing is that the first time you press <color:keypress>_</color> turns this system on, and initializes it with some pretty nice default preferences.

Now, you will find much of the junk you encounter being destroyed. For example, all those corpses and skeletons that you are leaving behind as you hack and slash your way through the dungeon. That in itself is rather nice. But, you will still run into objects you consider useless. For example, suppose you took that all important first step on the road to slaying Morgoth, and bought a lantern at the General Store. Now, you don't really care about torches anymore. Use the <color:keypress>k</color> command (or <color:keypress>^D</color> for the Roguelike keyset) and you get a prompt like:
  Really destroy <color:y>Wooden Torches {unidentified}</color>? <color:y>[y/n/Auto]</color>

Notice the <color:keypress>A</color>uto option. Choose that and you get a message that the object is destroyed, but the fact that you don't like torches is remembered by the system. The next time your character moves on top of one, it will automatically be destroyed.

And that is basically it. Keep registering stuff for automatic destruction as you encounter it, and you'll find objects becoming much easier to manage.

<topic:CorrectingMistakes><style:heading>Correcting Mistakes</style>

"Awesome! But what if I make a mistake and auto-register rings of speed?" Well, don't panic. You can easily fix things up, but doing so will require you to go back to the preference file editor. Press <color:keypress>_</color> and then press <color:keypress>END</color> to move to the end of the document. This is where the game keeps track of any objects that you automatically register for destruction during the Destroy Object command. Your screen might look something like:
<style:screenshot>
<color:B>(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)</color>         (0,199)

<color:R># Keep it by cut & paste if you need these lines for future characters.</color>

<color:B>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</color>
Destroy unidentified light sources whose name is beginning with "wooden torch$".
Not displayed in the full map.  This line will be delete later.
</style>

You cannot tell from the picture above, but I placed the cursor on the very last line of the file. In my case, this is the line from when I auto-registered torches for destruction. Notice that at the very bottom of the screen, the game tells you exactly what each line means, and what will happen for the given rule. If you are curious, you can move the cursor around the default preference file and actually learn quite a bit about how the system works. For now, though, if you wish to undo any rules that you automatically added, simply delete the corresponding line from this file and then exit with the <color:keypress>^W</color> option to save and apply your changes.

<topic:WantedObjects><style:heading>What About Stuff I Want?</style>

That's correct: What you don't want is only half the story. Some objects you really, really want, such as stat potions and 5d5 long swords. Wouldn't it be nice if the game automatically picked these objects up for you whenever you encountered them? Or, even better, what if the game showed them to you in the Object List command and the Full Map Display? Then, assuming your detection was good, you could quickly see what worthy objects might be laying about on the current level.

Well, you can do all these things. At the moment, we still don't know anything about what those lines in the editor mean, but we have a vague notion that each line represents a single rule somehow. We also know that the auto-destroy lines from the Destroy Object command are being added to the bottom and are being displayed in a funny color. Generally, those lines are hands off: The game manages them for you, though, as we just saw above, it's fine to go ahead and delete them if you made a mistake with the auto-register option. And, we saw that the game comes with lots of rules already set up for you. You can ignore those for the time being, though you can also learn a bit by moving the cursor around in the default file and reading the detailed explanation at the bottom.

This is great, but let's say you really want a particular object. Suppose you want potions of Cure Critical Wounds (I'm trying to think of an example that isn't set in the default preferences). It's early in the game, and you find yourself getting hurt quite often. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to automatically display these potions? Well, you can easily do so by adding the following line to the top of the file:
<style:screenshot>
<color:B>(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)</color>       <color:y>*</color> (0,5)-(20,5)

Bingo! You can even automatically travel to those delicious potions by pressing <color:keypress>`</color> inside the Object List. What could be easier? With features like these, why isn't <color:keyword>The Serpent of Chaos</color> dead already?

To recap, adding the line "Cure Critical Wounds" means to automatically pick up any object having "Cure Critical Wounds" as part of its name. You don't have to type so much: "Crit" might work just as well. But the less you type, the more likely it is that your new rule will match other objects. For example, "Cure" would match potions of Cure Light Wounds, Cure Serious Wounds and Cure Critical Wounds. It might also pick up some magical devices that have some sort of Cure effect. Sometimes this is OK and even desirable. Other times, it behooves you to type more.

<topic:IntroRulesEvents><style:heading>Introduction to Rules and Events</style>

Let's begin to learn what is going on. Basically, the preference file is an ordered list of rules. Whenever a certain event happens, such as moving on top of an object, the rules are scanned, in order, and the first one that matches, if any, is applied. Every rule has an action associate with it that determines what to do whenever this rule matches.

It is very important to keep in mind that order matters, and that it is the <color:v>first</color> matching rule that gets used. Often times, you might add a line to do something really important, but place it too low in the file so that it never gets used in practice. The default preference file is very careful about the ordering of the rules it adds. With time and practice, you will be too! If you are adding a rule to automatically pickup a new kind of object, like we did with "Cure Critical Wounds" in the previous section, simply add it to the very top of the file. With that approach, you generally won't go wrong.

The second point was that each rule is a single line in the file. You probably noticed that not every line in the file corresponds to a rule, though. There are comments and blank lines, for example. There are also conditional tests, but we won't discuss those just now. Comments begin with a <color:keypress>#</color> key and are ignored by the system. They are displayed in <color:G>green</color>. The syntax of a rule is discussed in the next section.

The final point was the notion of an event, or a point in time when the game will attempt to apply a rule. In general, this happens whenever (1) the player moves on top of an object, (2) gets a pseudo-id for an object (see <link:option.txt#destroy_feeling>) and (3) identifies an object (see <link:option.txt#destroy_identify>).

<topic:Rules><style:heading>Rules</style>

A rule is a single line that consists of an action to perform, a predicate to test matches, and an optional inscription to add. Let's discuss each of these in turn.

  <indent><color:o>Actions</color>

First of all, picking something up is the default action and is inferred whenever you fail to specify an alternative. What are the alternatives?

<color:keypress>!</color>  Destroy
<color:keypress>;</color>  Prompt to Pickup
<color:keypress>~</color>  Leave on the Floor

These are the primary actions. Pickup is assumed if you fail to type <color:keypress>!</color>,<color:keypress>;</color> or <color:keypress>~</color>.

In addition there are the following command letters that augment the primary action.

<color:keypress>(</color>  Don't display this item in the Full Map
<color:keypress>?</color>  Automatically Identify this item

The first one is not commonly used. Later in the game, your character might have the power to map the entire level at once. If there is a vault on the level, then many, many objects may match your pickup rules. Were they all to be displayed in the Full Map view, there would not be room to see them all, which can be annoying when that 5d5 long sword is not displayed but the potion of curing is. You'd really, really prefer to hear about that sword! With the <color:keypress>(</color> option, you will still automatically pickup the matching object, it's just that you won't get a text indicator in the Full Map screen. (But you should probably use the Object List command too, since it shows all matching objects in a scrollable list, sorted by object value).

The second additional option (viz., <color:keypress>?</color>) is very useful, since it automatically identifies the matching object. This is a <color:v>*HUGE*</color> timesaver ... when it works! But to work, you need to have either scrolls or a device with the identify power. Spell casters are currently out of luck :(

All of the action command letters must be specified first in the line for the rule, with one exception. The <color:keypress>#</color> letter indicates that you wish to automatically inscribe matching objects, and it must occur at the end of the rule, followed by the text to use for the actual inscription. For example, <color:U>#@ad!s!d!k</color> at the end of a rule will automatically inscribe <color:R>@ad!s!d!k</color> to any object matching the rule. If you don't know what this inscription means, it is not really important. You can see <link:objects.txt#Inscriptions> for information about inscriptions.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>Matching</color>
Matching is the most important part of a rule. We saw above that matching is by string comparison with the object name, but you can be more specific than that if you want. To do so, use the following keywords to construct a predicate used to test objects. The keyword portion of the match consists of zero or more adjectives modifying a noun that indicates the broad class of objects which should be considered. In addition, you can specify a free form text comparison string by adjoining <color:keypress>:</color> followed by text to search for. We'll put all of this together in the examples section below.

Let's do nouns first. A complete list is presented at the end of this document, but some common nouns to get us started include:

<color:R>Items</color>     <indent>Applies to everything. This is useful for very general rules, such as ~?<color:G>Unidentified</color> <color:R>Items</color> to automatically identify, but leave on the ground, everything not yet identified.</indent>
<color:R>Weapons</color>   <indent>Applies to all melees weapons, but not to missile weapons.</indent>
<color:R>Shooters</color>  <indent>Applies to all missile weapons, including bows, slings and crossbows.</indent>
<color:R>Armors</color>    <indent>Applies to all forms of armor, including shields, helms, cloaks as well as body armor.</indent>
<color:R>Wands</color>     Applies to magical devices that are wands
<color:R>Staves</color>    Applies to magical devices that are staves
<color:R>Rods</color>      Applies to magical devices that are rods
<color:R>Potions</color>   Applies to potions
<color:R>Scrolls</color>   Applies to scrolls

If you are using keywords to build a match predicate, then you must specify exactly one noun. But you may use as many adjectives as you like. The complete list of adjectives is given in the reference section of this document, but here are some of the more common ones:

<color:G>Unaware</color>      <indent>Applies to objects that the player is unaware of. In practice, this currently only includes mushrooms, potions and scrolls that the player has not yet encountered.</indent>
<color:G>Unidentified</color> <indent>Applies to objects that have not yet been identified.</indent>
<color:G>Ego</color>          <indent>Applies to all excellent objects.</indent>
<color:G>Dice Boosted</color> <indent>When used with <color:R>Weapons</color> or <color:R>Shooters</color>, this adjective indicates that the object has higher damage dice than usual. Archers in particular should be on the lookout for <color:G>Dice Boosted</color> <color:R>Shooters</color>!</indent>
<color:G>Wanted</color>       <indent>Combine with <color:R>Corpses</color> or <color:R>Skeletons</color> to indicated that the corpse or skeleton belongs to a wanted monster. These may be turned in at the Hunter's Office for a prize.</indent>

As an example of using multiple adjectives, the phrase <color:G>unidentified ego</color> <color:R>weapons</color> applies to, well, all melee weapons that are both excellent and not yet identified. Of course this means that you must have gotten a psuedo-id on the object in order to be aware that the object is excellent, since it is not yet identified. Still, this is a very useful phrase when combined with the <color:keypress>?</color> command letter!

Finally, use a search string to further refine the match. If you don't use any adjective or noun keywords, then the entire text of your rule (starting after any command letters, and including all text up to the <color:keypress>#</color> inscription character) is used as the search string. If you are using keywords, then you will need to mark the end of the keyword section with the <color:keypress>:</color> separator letter. Examples are discussed below.
</indent>
  <indent><color:o>Examples</color>

There will be a quiz on this later, so make sure you understand the following examples!

!<color:R>potions</color>:apple juice
  <indent>Destroy potions of apple juice (Who would want those?). It uses the <color:keypress>!</color> command letter for destruction, the <color:keyword>potions</color> keyword to apply to an entire class of objects, the <color:keypress>:</color> separator key, and an arbitrary text field to use for a string match against the object name.</indent>

?<color:G>unaware </color><color:R>items</color>
  <indent>Pickup and automatically identify unaware items (e.g. a potion you've never seen before). Note that the pickup action is implied since none of the other primary actions are indicated, and even though there is a secondary action (to auto-id). This command uses the adjective <color:G>unaware</color> to modify the noun <color:R>items</color>. You could narrow down the applicability of this rule by using a more specific noun, such as <color:R>rings</color> or <color:R>potions</color>.</indent>

<color:G>wanted </color><color:R>corpses</color><color:U>#Wanted!k!k!k</color>
  <indent>Pickup wanted corpses. These are corpses that you may turn in at the Hunter's Office for a prize. Automatically inscribe these objects with <color:U>Wanted!k!k!k</color>. If you don't know what !k means, see <link:objects.txt#Inscriptions> (OK, it means to prompt the user when using the <color:keypress>k</color> command to destroy objects. So, if you are paranoid and don't want to destroy something by mistake, you inscribe !k on it. In this case, whoever wrote this rule was <color:v>really</color> paranoid, since you will be prompted three times to confirm destruction!).</indent>

<color:R>potions</color>:resistance<color:U>#!k!q</color>
  <indent>Pickup all potions whose name contains the word "resistance". Automatically inscribe <color:R>!k!q</color> on these objects. In effect, this rule matches potions of resistance, but rather than using a string match of "potion of resistance" on all items, it uses a string match of "resistance" only on potions. Either approach would work equally well in this instance, but sometimes it is better to use the appropriate noun for the match, especially if you are dealing with objects that might come as ego items, as the next example indicates. Also, if you string match using "potions of resistance" by mistake, your rule will not work. Why it fails is left as an exercise for the reader!</indent>

?<color:R>staves</color>:destruction<color:U>#@ud!s!d!k</color>
  <indent>Pickup and automatically identify all staves whose name contains the word "destruction". Inscribe these objects with <color:U>@ud!s!d!k</color> as well. Note that using the noun <color:R>staves</color> with a string match on "destruction" works more reliably then a string match on "staff: destruction". Why this is the case will become apparent the first time you find a "staff of power: destruction".</indent>
</indent>

<topic:Scenarios><style:heading>Scenarios</style>

After that last section, you should have complete mastery over individual rules. Now, it is time to step up one level and apply multiple rules to accomplish common tasks. Ready?

  <indent><color:B>Scenario #1</color>: Handling Objects

In this scenario, you would like to handle the stream of objects in the most efficient way possible. Let's begin with the following rules:
  (<color:G>unidentified </color><color:R>armors</color>
  (<color:G>unidentified </color><color:R>weapons</color>

These rules say to pickup all armor and weapons not yet identified. That leaves out many types of objects, like potions and scrolls, but this scenario is just focusing on objects for which you might receive a pseudo-id. We use the <color:keypress>(</color> command letter to prevent the Full Map Screen from filling up with stuff not yet known to be desirable. But the auto-pickup is very nice, since items need to be in your pack for pseudo-id to kick in (until CL35, at least).

Now, lets add the following rules:
  !<color:G>average common </color><color:R>weapons</color>
  !<color:G>average common </color><color:R>armors</color>

In practice, we wouldn't want these right away since they say to destroy common stuff. You can handle that with conditionals, which I haven't discussed yet. For the moment, assume your character is advanced enough to not want to keep average equipment. These rules will fire once pseudo-id kicks in, destroying <color:keyword>junk</color>. (Of course, junk is relative, and you may want to keep some stuff). The <color:G>common</color> adjective prevents these rules from applying to rare average items, like dragon scale mail, or blades of chaos.

So, now our character is merrily picking up all equipment and then auto-destroying the average stuff once pseudo-id kicks in. Can we do more? Well, try adding:
  ?<color:G>unidentified ego </color><color:R>items</color>

Now, the egos are automatically being identified on psuedo-id as well. Pretty sweet! Finally, eventually you will learn that some ego types are junk, and perhaps would have auto registered some lines like:

  (!<color:G>common ego </color><color:R>cloaks</color>:of protection
  (!<color:G>common ego </color><color:R>weapons</color>:of *slay* orc
  etc.

So that even the junk excellent items are being toasted for you, automatically, with nary a keystroke on your part. But, sometimes egos become dice boosted, and the *slay* orc weapon might mean something to you if it is really powerful. You can protect it with
  <color:G>dice boosted </color><color:R>weapons</color>
or perhaps even
  <color:R>weapons</color><color:o> more dice than 30</color>
but that last one is an advanced maneuver.

In summary, the complete order of your rules might be:
  <color:R>weapons</color><color:o> more dice than 30</color>
  ?<color:G>unidentified ego </color><color:R>items</color>

  !<color:G>average common </color><color:R>weapons</color>
  !<color:G>average common </color><color:R>armors</color>

  (<color:G>unidentified </color><color:R>armors</color>
  (<color:G>unidentified </color><color:R>weapons</color>

  (!<color:G>common ego </color><color:R>cloaks</color>:of protection
  (!<color:G>common ego </color><color:R>weapons</color>:of *slay* orc

New armors and weapons come down and hit rule 5 or 6 when your character steps on them, so they get placed into your pack automatically (Remember, matching is based on your current knowledge of the object, not what it truly is. So, when you find, say, a dagger (+0, +0), it is not immediately destroyed since it is unidentified and not yet pseudo-identified: You don't yet know it is <color:G>average</color>!). Eventually, pseudo-id will kick in revealing the object as average, in which case it is destroyed by rule 3 or rule 4, or as excellent, in which case it is processed by rule 2 which auto-identifies the ego item and rescans the rules. If it is a cloak of protection, it is destroyed by rule 7, while if it is a weapon of *slay* orc, it is destroyed by rule 8. Unless it happened to be hugely dice boosted, in which case it got protected by rule 1 (remember, rules are processed in order). Easy, right? What happens to weapons/armors that psuedo-id as {Good}? Or {Special}?
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Scenario #2</color>: Flavored Objects
This one is easier, and I'll give the full set of rules first:
  <color:R>potions</color>:healing<color:U>#!k!q</color>
  <color:R>potions</color>:of strength<color:U>#!k</color>
  <color:R>potions</color>:of intelligence<color:U>#!k</color>
  <color:R>potions</color>:of wisdom<color:U>#!k</color>
  <color:R>potions</color>:of dexterity<color:U>#!k</color>
  <color:R>potions</color>:of constitution<color:U>#!k</color>
  <color:R>potions</color>:of charisma<color:U>#!k</color>
  <color:R>potions</color>:augmentation<color:U>#!k</color>

  <color:R>scrolls</color>:artifact creation<color:U>#!*</color>
  ...

  ?<color:G>unaware </color><color:R>items</color>

  <color:G>collecting </color><color:R>potions</color>
  <color:G>collecting </color><color:R>scrolls</color>

  <color:R>?:$AUTOREGISTER</color>
  ...
  (!<color:R>potions</color>:^potion of restore charisma$
  (!<color:R>scrolls</color>:^scroll of treasure detection$
  ... <many more junk flavors auto-registered for destruction> ...

Now, the pattern is wanted flavors on top for autopickup (and inscription), unwanted flavors on bottom for autodestruction (these are placed in your file automatically each time you press <color:keypress>A</color> while destroying an object) and rules for collecting and unaware items in the middle. Unaware items get automatically identified, at which point one of the pickup or destroy rules might get a chance to act. If this was a new flavor you find useless, destroy it and autoregister it for destruction so you never see it again. As for the <color:G>collecting</color> rules, those fire if you have another object of the same flavor in your pack. Perhaps you are carrying potions of cure critical wounds but don't have a rule specifically for this flavor. In this case, the collecting rule will pickup these objects for you.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Scenario #3</color>: Spellbooks
OK, this is the last one. See if you can figure this one out first:
  <color:G>first realm's fourth </color><color:R>spellbooks</color><color:U>#@md!s!d!k</color>
  <color:G>first realm's third </color><color:R>spellbooks</color><color:U>#@mc!k</color>
  ~<color:G>first realm's second </color><color:R>spellbooks</color><color:U>#@mb!k</color>
  ~<color:G>first realm's first </color><color:R>spellbooks</color><color:U>#@ma!k</color>
  <color:G>second realm's fourth </color><color:R>spellbooks</color><color:U>#@mh!s!d!k</color>
  <color:G>second realm's third </color><color:R>spellbooks</color><color:U>#@mg!k</color>
  ~<color:G>second realm's second </color><color:R>spellbooks</color><color:U>#@mf!k</color>
  ~<color:G>second realm's first </color><color:R>spellbooks</color><color:U>#@me!k</color>
  !<color:G>first </color><color:R>spellbooks</color>
  !<color:G>second </color><color:R>spellbooks</color>
  !<color:G>third </color><color:R>spellbooks</color>:major arcana
  !<color:G>fourth </color><color:R>spellbooks</color>:manual of mastery
  <color:G>third </color><color:R>spellbooks</color>
  <color:G>fourth </color><color:R>spellbooks</color>
Did you figure it out? This scenario picks up high level spellbooks from your player's realms of magics, leaves low level spellbooks from your player's realms of magics, destroys all other low level spellbooks, destroys all arcane magic spellbooks, but picks up high level spellbooks from other realms (presumably to sell for gold). Spellbooks from the player's realms are auto-inscribed to make casting a spell from the appropriate book consistently use the same letter to choose that book. Here, as elsewhere, order is very important. Rules for the player's spell realms must come before the general rules to destroy low level spellbooks. There is also an <color:G>unreadable</color> adjective that would have made processing safer, and less order dependant.
</indent>
<topic:WhichRule><style:heading>Which Rule is Being Used?</style>

If you are ever unsure about which rule is being applied in a given situation, turn on the destroy_debug option (see <link:option.txt#destroy_debug>). With this option you can use the <color:keypress>I</color>nspect command for more information. For example:
<style:screenshot>
  <color:u>a Thieves' Guide [Burglar's Handbook]</color>

    <color:r>Autopick:</color> (!<color:G>unreadable first </color><color:R>spellbooks</color>

  <color:B>6 Potions of Resist Cold</color>
    You get temporary resistance to cold when you quaff it. This
    resistance is cumulative with equipment.

    <color:r>Autopick:</color> <color:R>potions</color>:resist<color:U>#!k!q</color>
</style>
In the first case, this is a line automatically added when I destroyed an unreadable spellbook using the <color:keypress>k</color> command. In the second case, this is a line that comes as a default setting. I may or may not like this behavior, and if I don't, now I know which line to change!

In addition, with debugging turned on, the rules used are printed in the message log as actions are taken, so you can see exactly why objects are being destroyed, picked up, left on the ground or auto-identified. For example:

<style:screenshot>
  <indent>You have 26 charges remaining. <color:B>(AutoID</color><color:B>:</color>~?<color:G>unidentified </color><color:R>rods</color><color:B>)</color> You see <color:v>a </color>
<color:v>Rod: </color><color:W>Frost Ball</color><color:v> (</color><color:y>1/3 charges</color><color:v>)</color>. <color:B>(Destroy:</color>(!<color:R>rods</color>:frost ball$<color:B>)</color>
Auto-destroying.</indent>
</style>
Also, you might want to check out the <color:keypress>~_</color> Knowledge Option. Like the editor, it displays the rules for you in the order they are processed. But it only displays the rules that are currently active, which can be a useful thing to see if you add a lot of conditional rules.

<topic:Conditionals><style:heading>Conditional Rules</style>

This is an advanced topic. If you play a lot, then you probably play many different types of characters. You probably have rules for objects that you would like to share across all of your characters. While other characters, depending on their class, might have special needs. Finally, you might have some rules that you use early in the game, and others that you would like to turn on towards the end of the game. You can accomplish all of this using conditional statements to guard your individual rule definitions. The conditions are evaluated each time your preference file is loaded to determine which rules to apply. Oh, and don't worry, the game automatically reloads the file for you each time your player gains an experience level, so your conditions get checked automatically without any intervention on your part.

Imagine scanning the entire preference file from top to bottom, building a list of all the player's rules. Imagine now that there exists a switch that can be turned on and off. If the switch is on, then every rule line you read gets added to the list of current rules. If the switch is off, then every rule line you read gets skipped. Finally, imagine there are lines in the file that can turn this switch on and off. If you can imagine all of that, then, aside from the fact you are probably a computer programmer, you can understand how conditional rules work.

The rule lines have already been discussed, and you are surely a master of them by now. So we really only need to consider those lines that can flip our global switch. These are called <color:keyword>Conditional Lines</color> and they always begin with the characters <color:keyword>?:</color> followed by a (rather cryptic looking) expression.

Let's look at an example. Remember <color:B>Scenario #1</color> above when we added lines to destroy average equipment? Well, in practice, you would probably want those rules to not be used in the early game. Perhaps once your character reaches a certain level, you would want to add them. Well, try the following instead:

  <color:v>?:[GEQ $LEVEL 20]</color>
  !<color:G>average common </color><color:R>weapons</color>
  !<color:G>average common </color><color:R>armors</color>
  <color:v>?:1</color>

Notice there are two lines colored in <color:v>violet</color>, each beginning with <color:keyword>?:</color>. These are the Conditional Lines. The first one executes a funny looking expression while the second one is much simpler, albeit just as hard to fathom. In programming, one typically uses numbers to represent everything, and this case is no different. We represent the state of our global switch as a number. When it is 0, the switch is off. When it is nonzero, the switch is on. So the first conditional might or might not flip the switch. It depends on the value of $LEVEL (which you probably guessed is the player's current experience level) and whether or not it is >= 20. GEQ stands for greater than or equal to, and 20 is just a number. And the expression is presented in a funny order as [GEQ $LEVEL 20] rather than $LEVEL GEQ 20 (or even $LEVEL >= 20). You might not find this odd, but if that is the case, then you probably (like me) enjoy programming in LISP or Scheme. In these languages, functions are always expressed as (f x y z) to evaluate the function f with the arguments x, y and z. And >= is a function just like any other (it returns a number which we think of as a boolean value, being either non-zero for TRUE, or zero for FALSE). You can also nest calls. Perhaps x must be computed as (g u v) which calls function g with arguments u and v. Then, instead of (f x y z) you write (f (g u v) y z). Got it?

Now make those parentheses square as [f [g u v] y z], tag variables with a leading $ so our parser can figure things out, rename operators with three letter abbreviations, "turn up the volume" making everything uppercase, and you will finally understand [GEQ $LEVEL 20].

In contrast, <color:v>?:1</color> is easy. Like any good Scheme wannabe, literal values are self evaluating. Which is just a fancy way of saying that the value of 1 is itself, viz. 1. No confusion. And 1 means true, which means turn the switch back on in case the first Conditional Line turned it off. And in case it isn't obvious, the switch is always turned on before starting the scan, so you don't need a <color:v>?:1</color> at the top of the file.

Here's another, more complicated example:
<style:wide>  <color:v>?:[OR [EQU $CLASS Mage High-Mage Sorcerer] [EQU $RACE Beholder Lich] ]</color>
  wizardstaff
  <color:v>?:1</color></style>
That's a complicated expression to determine who wants to gather a wizardstaff, but I'm willing to bet you can figure it out without waiting for my explanation. In words, if the player's class is either a Mage, High-Mage or a Sorcerer; <color:v>or</color> if the player's race is either a Beholder or a Lich, then the player wants a wizardstaff (rather badly, actually). So we really have the expression (or a b) where a and b are computed values using subexpressions to test the player's class or race (and you should try playing a Beholder sometime; they are quite fun!).

So, we have expressions composed of functions, variables, literals and parentheses. What are the functions and variables we can use?

<color:G>Function  Explanation</color>
  <color:keyword>IOR</color>     <indent>Inclusive Or: [IOR a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of <color:o>any</color> subexpression a, b, c, ... is TRUE.</indent>
  <color:keyword>OR</color>      <indent>Same as IOR. One day I was puzzled why my [OR ...] expression wasn't working. Also, if you are going to have IOR, it suggests you will have XOR (Exclusive Or) as well, and we don't!</indent>
  <color:keyword>AND</color>     <indent>Logical And: [AND a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of <color:o>all</color> subexpressions a, b, c, ... are TRUE.</indent>
  <color:keyword>NOT</color>     <indent>[NOT a] is TRUE if a is FALSE, and vice versa. Use this when you want to take an action when something is <color:o>not</color> true.</indent>
  <color:keyword>EQU</color>     <indent>[EQU v a b c ...] is TRUE when the value of v is <color:o>one</color> of the values a, b, c, ... Comparison is by string. Typically, you use this with v being a built-in variable expression, like <color:keyword>$CLASS</color> (see below) and the remaining arguments to EQU being strings to test, like <color:keyword>Warrior</color> or <color:keyword>Rogue</color>. Note that string literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain spaces.</indent>
  <color:keyword>LEQ</color>     <indent>[LEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is <color:o>less than or equal to</color> the integer value of a. Note that while EQU treats its arguments as strings, LEQ treats them as numbers.</indent>
  <color:keyword>GEQ</color>     <indent>[GEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is <color:o>greater than or equal to</color> the integer value of a. Note that while EQU treats its arguments as strings, GEQ treats them as numbers. For example, use <color:v>[GEQ $LEVEL 20]</color> to test if the player's current level is greater than, or equal to 20.</indent>

<color:G>Variable  Explanation</color>
<color:keyword>$RACE</color>     <indent>Returns the name of the player's race. For example, <color:keyword>Snotling</color> or <color:keyword>High-Elf</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$CLASS</color>    <indent>Returns the name of the player's class. For example, <color:keyword>Warrior-Mage</color> or <color:keyword>Mindcrafter</color>. Note, if you are playing in <color:r>Monster</color> mode, then this variable always returns <color:keyword>Monster</color>, while $RACE returns the actual monster race you are playing, such as <color:keyword>Lich</color> or <color:keyword>Dragon</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$REALM1</color>   <indent>Returns the name of the player's first realm, if any. For example, <color:keyword>Chaos</color> or <color:keyword>Sorcery</color>. If the player does not have a first realm, then this variable returns <color:keyword>none</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$REALM2</color>   <indent>Returns the name of the player's second realm, if any. For example, <color:keyword>Life</color> or <color:keyword>Death</color>. If the player does not have a second realm, then this variable returns <color:keyword>none</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$LEVEL</color>    <indent>Returns the player's current level. Typically, you combine this with GEQ or LEQ to test the level against a threshold, such as <color:v>[LEQ $LEVEL 34]</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$MONEY</color>    <indent>Returns the amount of gold the player has. Like $LEVEL, use this with GEQ or LEQ to test whether your player is rich or poor.</indent>

As mentioned before, all variables begin with a <color:keypress>$</color> character to distinguish them from string literals.

<color:G>Literal   Explanation</color>
<color:keyword>Number</color>    <indent>Numbers are written like <color:keyword>105</color> or <color:keyword>32</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>String</color>    <indent>Strings are written like <color:keyword>High-Mage</color> or <color:keyword>Beholder</color>. Note that string literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain spaces.</indent>

<topic:Editor><style:heading>Using the Editor</style>

We've gotten this far, and I bet you've been using the built in preference editor just fine. It is pretty easy to use, and you can probably figure it out on your own. Like any text editor you have used, you move the cursor about with the arrow keys and then type when you have located the correct position. Navigation keys like <color:keypress>HOME</color> and <color:keypress>END</color> might not be standard, since they take you to the top or bottom of the document, rather than the beginning or end of the current line, but you'll get used to the various quirks.

I really don't feel a need to document the editor at all, since it has a complete menu structure which you can browse and learn all the commands. Simply press <color:keypress>ESC</color> to get started and then follow the various options. For example:
<style:screenshot>
<color:B>(a-j) Command:</color>
<color:G>#***</color> <color:b>+---------------------------+</color>
<color:G>#*** </color><color:b>|</color><color:B> a) Help                   </color><color:b>|</color><color:G>Picker Editor for the first time.</color>

Here, you can clearly see what commands to use to move the cursor about (And if you are running on the <color:keyword>Curses</color> platform, you'll notice that arrow keys don't work so you'll need to learn the control key alternatives).

One comment I will make on the editor is that it colors each rule line according to the syntax of the expression. I personally find this rather useful. However, sometimes the text displayed is not the same as the rule you actually typed in, even though the meaning is the same. For example, if you use multiple adjectives, then they might get reordered when they are drawn with syntax coloring. In order to avoid confusion, the current line (viz. the line under the cursor) is never syntax colored and always displays exactly what you typed.

<topic:Reference><style:heading>Reference Tables</style>

This section will give all the nitty gritty syntax details for <color:keyword>The Mogaminator</color>. But first, where are those preference files located anyway? The default preferences are initialized from lib/pref/pickpref.prf which is located in your game's directory structure. If you don't like the defaults that I have provided and would like to use your own, then this is the file to edit. Once you enable the system, your preferences are stored in a separate file in a system dependant location. On Windows, they will be stored in lib/user/pickpref-<color:o>NAME</color>.prf inside the game's directory structure, while on Linux, they can be found in ~/.angband/PosChengband/pickpref-<color:o>NAME</color>.prf (outside the game's directory structure). Here, <color:o>NAME</color> is replaced with your player's current name. So if you want to edit your preferences using some other text editor, this is the file you need to change. If you do edit preferences outside of the game while you are playing, then be sure to use the <color:keypress>$</color> command to force the game to reload the preference file.

OK, so I promised you reference tables. I'm a man of my word, so here they are. Enjoy!

<color:B>Table I: Line Types in the Editor</color>
  <indent><color:G>Type        Explanation</color>
<color:keyword>Comment</color>     <indent>These lines begin with a <color:keypress>#</color> and are ignored by the system. Feel free to add them whenever you want to document what you are trying to do so that you can better understand the file in the future. I like to add comments to visually break the file up into different sections, such as Consumables, Weapons, Armor and Devices.</indent>

<color:keyword>Conditional</color> <indent>These lines flip the global processing switch ON and OFF. If the expression evaluates to TRUE, then the switch is turned ON and any subsequent rules will be included. If the expression evaluates to FALSE, the switch is turned OFF and any subsequent rules will be ignored. Use Conditional Lines so that your rule base adapts to the variety of classes and situations that you encounter. If this is gibberish to you, then you probably skipped the section <link:editor.txt#Conditionals> above!</indent>

<color:keyword>Rule</color>        <indent>Every other line, unless it is blank, is a rule. The syntax of a rule is described in the following 5 tables.</indent>
</indent>
<color:B>Table II: Rules: Syntax</color>
  <indent>Rules have one of the following two syntactic forms:
<style:wide><style:indent><color:y>[</color>Commands<color:y>]</color> <color:G>Adjective</color><color:y>*</color> <color:R>Noun</color> <color:o>Special-Clause</color><color:y>*</color> <color:y>[</color><color:keypress>:</color>Search-String<color:y>]</color> <color:y>[</color><color:U>#Inscription-String</color><color:y>]</color></style></style>

<color:y>[</color>Commands<color:y>]</color> Search-String <color:y>[</color><color:U>#Inscription-String</color><color:y>]</color>

Square brackets denote optional syntactic elements. * is the Kleene-Star and indicates that 0 or more of the preceding syntactic elements may be specified. All rules must be specified on a single line in your preference file.

<color:G>Syntactic Element  Explanation</color>
Commands           <indent>These are actions to take whenever this rule matches. They are built up with command leters as described in the next table. If this element is omitted, then this rule will pickup any matching objects.</indent>

<color:G>Adjective</color>          <indent>These modify Nouns, further narrowing down the set of objects that will match this rule.</indent>

<color:R>Noun</color>               <indent>A single noun is always specified for the first syntactic form and indicates the broad class of objects to which this rule shall apply.</indent>

<color:o>Special-Clause</color>     <indent>These consist of further rule match refinements and are discussed below. They are like adjectives in that they modify nouns, but they also involve some sort of numerical comparison of an object attribute, and therefore require special syntax. They also always follow the Noun while Adjectives precede the Noun.</indent>

Search-String      <indent>This is a free form text value to compare against the object's name. Comparison is by string and is case-insensitive. In addition, you may use the <color:keypress>^</color> special character at the beginning of a Search-String to force your match to the beginning of an object name, and the <color:keypress>$</color> special character at the end of a Search-String to force your match to the end of the object name. For example, <color:keyword>^Foo</color> will only match objects whose names begin with <color:keyword>Foo</color>, and will skip other objects that might have <color:keyword>Foo</color> somewhere in the name, but not at the beginning. Similarly, <color:keyword>Bar$</color> only matches objects whose name ends with <color:keyword>Bar</color> and skips any that might have <color:keyword>Bar</color> someplace in the middle of its name. Finally note that an object's name is always in the singular. So, for example, <color:keyword>Seeker Bolt</color> would work for a string match, but <color:keyword>Seeker Bolts</color> would always fail.</indent>

<color:U>Inscription-String</color> <indent>This is a free form text value that will be automatically inscribed on any object matching this rule.</indent>

If you didn't understand some of that, you should probably review the tutorial sections above, starting with <link:editor.txt#IntroRulesEvents>. The examples section above, in particular, is probably the best way to learn what is going on.
</indent>
<color:B>Table III: Rules: Command Letters</color>
  <indent><color:G>Letter  Type       Explanation</color>
  <color:keypress>!</color>     Primary    Destroy
  <color:keypress>;</color>     Primary    Prompt to Pickup
  <color:keypress>~</color>     Primary    Leave on the Floor
        Primary    <indent>Pickup is assumed if you fail to provide an alternative primary command letter. There is no command letter for this action, it is simply the default action to take unless overridden.</indent>
  <color:keypress>(</color>     Secondary  <indent>Don't display this item in the Full Map Screen.</indent>
  <color:keypress>?</color>     Secondary  <indent>Automatically Identify this item. This requires you to carry scrolls or magical devices with the Identify power. It does not currently work for spellcasters.</indent>
  <color:keypress>#</color>     Terminal   <indent>Auto-inscribe matching objects with whatever text follows this key. Note that Primary and Secondary command letters must be placed at the beginning of a rule line, while Terminal command letters must be placed at the end of a rule line.</indent>

Every rule must have one Primary action. It can have 0 or more secondary actions, and the sole Terminal action is also optional.
</indent>
<color:B>Table IV: Rules: Nouns</color>
  <indent><color:G>Noun       Explanation</color>
<color:R>Items</color>      <indent>Applies to everything. This is useful for very general rules, such as ~?<color:G>Unidentified</color> <color:R>Items</color> to automatically identify, but leave on the ground, everything not yet identified.</indent>

<color:R>Weapons</color>    <indent>Applies to all melees weapons, but not to missile weapons. If you are a veteran player, then read that description again. This noun used to include shooters, but I just recently changed the semantics to accomodate archers who are very interested in <color:G>Dice Boosted</color> <color:R>Shooters</color> but could usually care less about <color:G>Dice Boosted</color> <color:R>Weapons</color>. Also, monks may want to !<color:R>Weapons</color> since they usually fight bare-handed, and having this rule also destroy shooters is quite annoying.</indent>

<color:R>Favorite Weapons</color>
           <indent>Applies to all weapons, including shooters, that are desired by your class. For example, Weaponmasters specialize in a given class of weapons, such as Axes or Crossbows. Whatever their speciality, this "noun" will apply to these preferred items. Calling this "keyword" a noun is a bit of a misnomer, but it will help you to think of <color:R>Favorite Weapons</color> as a single word that is a <color:R>Noun</color>, since the code treats it that way! For example, saying <color:G>Ego</color> <color:R>Favorite Weapons</color> is syntactically correct, while <color:G>Favorite Ego</color> <color:R>Weapons</color> is not. (There is no adjective called <color:G>Favorite</color>).</indent>

<color:R>Hafted Weapons</color>
           <indent>Applies to all hafted weapons like Maces, Flails and War Hammers. These weapons are preferred by Priests who disdain other kinds of weapons, such as Swords or Polearms. Like the <color:R>Favorite Weapons</color> "noun" above, it helps to think of <color:R>Hafted Weapons</color> as a single word that is a <color:R>Noun</color>, since the code treats it that way (There is no adjective <color:G>Hafted</color>). If you are a priest interested in excellent and artifact hafted weapons, you need to say <color:G>Ego</color> <color:R>Hafted Weapons</color> or <color:G>Artifact</color> <color:R>Hafted Weapons</color> to get the job done.</indent>

<color:R>Diggers</color>    <indent>Applies to all digging implements, such as shovels and picks. Digging is fun, but eventually you will probably want to destroy these objects. Perhaps, you would like the rule ~<color:G>Dice Boosted </color><color:R>Diggers</color>:Mattock followed by the rule !<color:R>Diggers</color>?</indent>

<color:R>Shooters</color>   <indent>Applies to all missile weapons, including bows, slings and crossbows. It also includes harps and guns. If you are a Bard, then you might consider <color:R>Shooters</color>:Harp as a pickup preference, while if you are ignoring archery altogether, try <color:R>Shooters</color>:Gun instead since the guns are quite useful for resistances and boosting stats.</indent>

<color:R>Ammo</color>       <indent>Applies to all ammunition for missile weapons: arrows, shots and bolts. Consider using <color:R>Ammo</color>:Seeker or <color:R>Ammo</color>:Mithril or <color:R>Ammo</color>:Steel to pick out desirable ammo.</indent>

<color:R>Armors</color>     <indent>Applies to all forms of armor, including shields, helms, cloaks as well as body armor. You can narrow down the range of armor objects by using a more specific noun from the following list:</indent>
           <indent><color:R>Suits</color>   Applies to body armor
<color:R>Shields</color> Applies to shields
<color:R>Cloaks</color>  Applies to cloaks
<color:R>Helms</color>   Applies to helmets and crowns
<color:R>Gloves</color>  Applies to gloves
<color:R>Boots</color>   Applies to boots
Consider using <color:R>Armors</color>:Dragon to pickup all the various forms of dragon armor, including dragon boots, gloves, helmets and wings. If you are playing a class with armor weight restrictions, check out the <color:o>More Weight Than NN</color> special clause below.</indent>

<color:R>Wands</color>      <indent>Applies to magical devices that are wands. Use <color:R>Wands</color>:Rockets to get all wands, including ego and artifact wands, that can fire rockets (Trust me: You want them!). Note: We no longer have a noun <color:R>Magical Devices</color>.</indent>

<color:R>Staves</color>     <indent>Applies to magical devices that are staves. For example, try <color:R>Staves</color>:Healing or <color:R>Staves</color>:Speed.</indent>

<color:R>Rods</color>       Applies to magical devices that are rods.

<color:R>Potions</color>    <indent>Applies to potions. There are many useful potions. If you are trying to get stat potions, you might consider <color:R>Potions</color>:of Strength rather than just <color:R>Potions</color>:Strength, since the latter will also match potions of restore strength.</indent>

<color:R>Scrolls</color>    Applies to scrolls

<color:R>Rings</color>      <indent>Applies to jewelry that are rings. Since rings are so useful, I like the rule ?<color:G>Unidentified</color> <color:R>Rings</color> for all of my characters.</indent>

<color:R>Amulets</color>    <indent>Applies to jewelry that are amulets. Like rings, I prefer to keep the rule ?<color:G>Unidentified</color> <color:R>Amulets</color> for all of my characters.</indent>

<color:R>Lights</color>     <indent>These are torches, lanterns and feanorian lamps, as well as the various artifact light sources. If you are looking for the Jewel of Judgment, try using <color:R>Lights</color>:Jewel.</indent>

<color:R>Spellbooks</color> <indent>These are all the spellbooks, for all of the various magical realms. If you are a spellcaster, you will invariably want to make use of the numerous spellbook specific adjectives described in the next table.</indent>

<color:R>Junk</color>       <indent>Need I say more? You probably just need !<color:R>Junk</color> in your pref file, though some junk might be useful for some players.</indent>

<color:R>Corpses</color>    <indent>Corpses actually can be useful. For one thing, every player can turn in <color:G>Wanted</color> <color:R>Corpses</color> at the Hunter's Office for prizes. And then there are possessors, a monster race that can actually possess the corpse of a slain foe and gain the powers of that monster type. They will want to make use of rules like ~<color:R>Corpses</color> <color:o>More Level Than 20</color> which uses a special form described below. Of course, they will tweak the level threshold of corpses they wish to keep as the game progresses, and they also need to be careful to keep rather than pickup these desirable objects: Corpses can be very heavy! Note that Skeletons no longer count as corpses, mainly because Possessors cannot possess skeletons so they require a more specific keyword. If you are a hungry demon, you might consider <color:G>Human</color> <color:R>Corpses</color>.</indent>

<color:R>Skeletons</color>  <indent>Like corpses, you may turn in <color:G>Wanted</color> <color:R>Skeletons</color> at the Hunter's Office. Archers may also use skeletons to make arrows and bolts, so this class of objects is not as useless as you might have thought.</indent>

If you are using keywords to build a match predicate, then you must specify exactly one noun. But you may use as many adjectives as you like.
</indent>
<color:B>Table V: Rules: Adjectives</color>
  <indent>There are many adjectives, and perhaps it might be useful to group them by kind?

<color:o>Object Knowledge</color>
<color:G>Unidentified</color> <indent>Applies to objects that have not yet been identified and is a very useful adjective. For example, ?<color:G>Unidentified</color> <color:R>Items</color> has to be my favorite rule of all time!</indent>

<color:G>Identified</color>   <indent>Applies all objects that have been identified. You might use this with a rule like !<color:G>Identified</color> <color:R>Weapons</color>, preceded by rules to protect weapons you actually care about, like dice boosted ego items, for example. But I think it is almost always preferable to use a !<color:G>Nameless Common</color> <color:R>Weapons</color> rule instead, since it is much safer (e.g. It won't destroy rare objects like Blades of Chaos and won't destroy egos either).</indent>

<color:G>*Identified*</color> <indent>Applies to fully identified objects, and is rarely needed. Perhaps you might consider a block of rules like:
~<color:G>*identified* </color><color:R>rings</color><color:o> more value than 5000</color>
~<color:G>*identified* </color><color:R>amulets</color><color:o> more value than 5000</color>
~?<color:G>unidentified </color><color:R>rings</color>
~?<color:G>unidentified </color><color:R>amulets</color>
!<color:G>identified </color><color:R>rings</color>
!<color:G>identified </color><color:R>amulets</color>
But this requires you to have a good sense of the value threshold for jewelry you might want. Also note that this rule set is safe because, in the current version, identifying jewelry also *identifies* it. Do not try this pattern with other types of objects!</indent>

<color:G>Unaware</color>      <indent>Applies to objects that the player is unaware of. In practice, this currently only includes mushrooms, potions and scrolls that the player has not yet encountered. A rule like ?<color:G>Unaware</color> <color:R>Items</color> will help you learn all those flavors in the early game.</indent>

<color:o>Object Quality</color>
<color:G>Average</color>      <indent>Just like the name says, this adjective matches average items. These are items that lack any form of magical bonus or enhancment. This adjective is best combined with the ! command letter at a very early point in the game :)</indent>

<color:G>Good</color>         <indent>Good items have a magical bonus of some kind, either a combat bonus to hit or damage for <color:R>weapons</color> and <color:R>shooters</color>, or an armor class bonus for <color:R>armors</color>. You might want to hang on to these objects a bit longer since they can be sold for gold in the town, but even here, you will want to destroy them eventually. I usually use the rule !<color:G>Nameless Common</color> <color:R>Weapons</color> rather than the <color:G>Good</color> adjective, since <color:G>Nameless</color> will include average items as well, while the <color:G>Common</color> adjective protects objects that are rare and might still be useful, even if they are only Average or Good (e.g. Dragon Scale Mail).</indent>

<color:G>Ego</color>          <indent>Applies to all excellent objects. See <link:objects.txt#EgoObjects> for more information.</indent>

<color:G>Artifact</color>     <indent>Artifacts are special items and are unique. Think of them as super-ego objects that you can only find one of in each game you play. I almost never use this adjective, though, since you cannot destroy artifacts anyway. Perhaps you might like to auto-identify them, though, and a rule like ?<color:G>Artifact</color> <color:R>Items</color> would accomplish this.</indent>

<color:G>Cursed</color>       <indent>Cursed items aren't necessarily all bad. Still, you might want rules to handle these objects, for example, to destroy them. Also note that objects can be <color:G>Cursed Ego</color> <color:R>Items</color> or even <color:G>Cursed Artifact</color> <color:R>Items</color>, so perhaps the rule you are looking for is !<color:G>Cursed Nameless Common</color> <color:R>Items</color>.</indent>

<color:G>Nameless</color>     <indent>Nameless applies to any object that is neither an artifact nor an ego item. This adjective is commonly used to destroy stuff that you know won't be particularly good, usually as a rule of the form !<color:G>Nameless Common</color> <color:R>Items</color>.</indent>

<color:G>Rare</color>         <indent>Rare items are special objects that don't show up often, and might still be desirable even if they are <color:G>Nameless</color>. For example, and hopefully this won't spoil too much, weapons like Blades of Chaos and armors like Dragon Scale Mail are considered <color:G>Rare</color>.</indent>

<color:G>Common</color>       <indent>Common includes any object that is <color:v>not</color> <color:G>Rare</color>. So, a Long Sword is common, but a Blade of Chaos is not. Metal Scale Mail is common, but White Dragon Scale Mail is not.</indent>

<color:G>Worthless</color>    <indent>Any object whose value is 0 is considered <color:G>Worthless</color>. This doesn't necessarily mean you want to destroy it, though. For example, Corpses are worthless, but you still want some of them. In general, you will want rules to protect the worthless items you might want, and then, at the very bottom of your preference file, you add a rule !<color:G>Worthless</color> <color:R>Items</color>.</indent>

<color:o>Object Attributes</color>
<color:G>Dice Boosted</color> <indent>When used with <color:R>Weapons</color> or <color:R>Shooters</color>, this adjective indicates that the object has higher damage dice than usual. Archers in particular should be on the lookout for <color:G>Dice Boosted</color> <color:R>Shooters</color>!</indent>

See the <color:o>Special Clauses</color> below for more information about matching on an object's attributes.

<color:o>Spellbook Adjectives</color>
<color:G>Unreadable</color>     <indent>This will match spellbooks that you cannot use, either because you are playing a non-magical class, or because you did not choose to learn that particular magical realm at birth. The most common use for this adjective is for destruction purposes, as in !<color:G>Unreadable</color> <color:R>Spellbooks</color>.</indent>

<color:G>First Realm's</color>  <indent>This refers to your primary magical realm. For many players, this is their only magic realm. For example, if you are playing a High-Mage, Paladin, Monk, Rogue or Chaos-Warrior, then you can pick a single realm of magic at birth.</color>

<color:G>Second Realm's</color> <indent>This refers to your secondary magical realm. If you are playing a Mage, Priest or Ranger, then you can pick two realms of magic at birth. The most common reason to distinguish between your first and second realms of magic has to do with inscriptions. Typically, players inscribe <color:U>@ma</color> through <color:U>@md</color>, in order, on their first realm's spellbooks, and use <color:U>@me</color> through <color:U>@mh</color>, in order, on their second realm's spellbooks. Or you might use <color:U>@m1</color> through <color:U>@m8</color> if you prefer.</color>

<color:G>First</color>
<color:G>Second</color>
<color:G>Third</color>
<color:G>Fourth</color>         <indent>Each realm of magic has four possible spellbooks. These adjectives refer to each of these possibilities. For every school except Arcane, only the first and second spellbooks are available in town, while the third and fourth spellbooks must be found in the dungeon. They can be quite rare, and are also valuable objects, so one typically wants to distinguish between first and second spellbooks on the one hand, and third and fourth on the other. Also, combine these adjectives with the <color:G>First Realm's</color> and <color:G>Second Realm's</color> adjectives discussed above in order to get your inscriptions setup properly (see <color:B>Scenario #3</color> above).</indent>

<color:o>Corpse Adjectives</color>
<color:G>Wanted</color>       <indent>Combine with <color:R>Corpses</color> or <color:R>Skeletons</color> to indicate that the corpse or skeleton belongs to a wanted monster. These may be turned in at the Hunter's Office for a prize.</indent>

<color:G>Unique</color>       <indent>Combine with <color:R>Corpses</color> or <color:R>Skeletons</color> to indicate that the corpse or skeleton belongs to a unique monster. Not all unique monsters are <color:G>Wanted</color>, so many players would consider them to be junk (They are destroyed by the default rule !<color:G>Worthless</color> <color:R>Items</color>). However, other players enjoy collecting the corpses of unique monsters, and placing them on display at the museum. For these (strange?) folks, adding a rule like ~<color:G>Unique</color> <color:R>Corpses</color> before the !<color:G>Worthless</color> <color:R>Items</color> will protect them from default destruction.</indent>

<color:G>Human</color>        <indent>And then there are those character's that require the corpses of humans for either food, or as part of a ritual to summon a powerful demonic ally. For these situations, add a rule like ~<color:G>Human</color> <color:R>Corpses</color> to your preferences, though ~<color:G>Special</color> <color:R>Items</color> also works.</indent>

<color:o>Miscellaneous</color>
<color:G>Collecting</color>   <indent><color:G>Collecting</color> <color:R>Items</color> are stackable objects that you happen to currently be carrying in your pack. Use this broad adjective when you don't feel like adding a more specific rule. For example, you might currently be carrying Potions of Cure Serious Wounds, and would like to collect those if you happen to find them. But since these objects are only useful for a very small portion of the game, you don't want to use a conditional rule to handle this.</color>

<color:G>Special</color>      <indent><color:G>Special</color> <color:R>Items</color> are objects your race or class needs; objects that are usually considered junk by default. For example, some players cannot eat normal food, but must consume the corpses of humans (Yuk!). Other players use corpses for various spells, and need to keep them around. Archers use skeletons to make their own ammo. And classes that ride pets into battle actually enjoy using devices that haste monsters. All of these special scenarios are handled with this adjective.</color>

<color:G>Unusable</color>     <indent>This adjective applies to wearable items that your current character is unable to wear. Doe this sound strange? It is, but remember that you have the option to play the game as a <color:r>Monster</color>, and monsters often have unusual body types. For example, a Dragon can wear rings, amulets, lights, cloaks and helmets, but nothing else. So weapons, shooters, body armor, shields, gloves, and boots are all considered <color:G>Unusable</color>. Adding a rule like !<color:G>Unusable</color> <color:R>Items</color> makes the game much more pleasant, at least once the player is past the point of worrying too much about gold. (They could also use a rule like !<color:G>Unusable Nameless</color> <color:R>Items</color> if they wanted to keep egos for resale purposes).</color>
</indent>
<color:B>Table VI: Rules: Special Clauses</color>
  <indent>In the following clauses, N refers to a numerical digit, 0 through 9. The sequence NN means you may type one or two digits, and can therefore enter any number between 0 and 99.  The sequence NNNNNN means you may type from one to six digits, and can therefore enter any number between 0 and 999999. If you enter too many digits, then the parser will not recognize your special clause, and you will get unsatisfactory results from your rule.

<color:G>Special Clause          Explanation</color>
<color:o>More Dice Than NN</color>       <indent>This clause applies to <color:R>Weapons</color> only, and is true whenever the maximum possible damage exceeds the number you enter. For example a (2d5) weapon will match <color:o>More Dice Than 9</color> but will fail to match <color:o>More Dice Than 10</color>.</indent>

<color:o>More Bonus Than NN</color>      <indent>An object's bonus is the largest of its <color:keyword>pval</color>, its bonus to hit, to damage and to armor class. Confused? Well, the rule <color:R>Rings</color> <color:o>More Bonus Than 9</color>:Speed will pickup rings of speed (+10) or better, but will not match other rings of speed. Another (sarcastic) example: <color:R>Suits</color> <color:o>More Bonus Than 19</color>:Power Dragon says that you would like Power Dragon Scale Mail, but only if its bonus to armor class is +20 or better!</indent>

<color:o>More Level Than NN</color>      <indent>This clause is intended to be used on <color:R>Corpses</color> so that Possessors can manage the mountains of dead bodies they create. You can also use it with other objects, in which case it corresponds to the level of the object, or its ego type. For devices, it matches against the power level of the device.</indent>

<color:o>More Weight Than NN</color>     <indent>Some classes have weight restrictions on armor, like Monks, Scouts and Ninjas. Other classes, like Maulers, prefer very heavy weapons. This clause matches against the weight of the object, in pounds. So <color:R>Weapons</color> <color:o>More Weight Than 39</color> will match weapons at least 39.1 lbs in weight (In practice, this means at least 40.0 lbs in weight).</indent>

<color:o>More Value Than NNNNNN</color> <indent>This clause matches against the known value of the object. Use it with care, since unknown, or even un-*identified* objects may have disturbingly low known values.</indent>
</indent>
<color:B>Table VII: Conditional Lines: Syntax</color>
  <indent>Conditional Lines have the following syntactic form:

?:<color:B>Expression</color>

Conditional Expressions use the following (partial) grammar:

<color:B>Expression</color> <color:y>:=</color> <indent><style:indent><color:r>Literal</color> <color:y>|</color> <color:v>Variable</color> <color:y>|</color> [<color:R>Function</color> <color:B>Expression</color><color:y>*</color>]</style></indent>
<color:R>Function</color>   <color:y>:=</color> <indent><style:indent>IOR <color:y>|</color> OR <color:y>|</color> AND <color:y>|</color> NOT <color:y>|</color> EQU <color:y>|</color> LEQ <color:y>|</color> GEQ</style></indent>
<color:v>Variable</color>   <color:y>:=</color> <indent><style:indent>$RACE <color:y>|</color> $CLASS <color:y>|</color> $REALM1 <color:y>|</color> $REALM2 <color:y>|</color> $LEVEL <color:y>|</color> $MONEY <color:y>|</color> ...</style></indent>
<color:r>Literal</color>    <color:y>:=</color> <indent><style:indent>23 <color:y>|</color> 52 <color:y>|</color> Rage-Mage <color:y>|</color> High-Elf <color:y>|</color> ... </style></indent>

Note that unlike above, square brackets are part of the syntax of expressions and do <color:v>not</color> indicate optional elements in the grammar. Rather, function application expressions are always surrounded with square brackets.

When the expression on a conditional line evaluates to FALSE or 0, then any subsequent rules will be ignored. When the expression evaluates to TRUE or non-zero, then any subsequent rules will be applied.

If none of this makes sense, see <link:editor.txt#Conditionals> above.

<color:B>Table VIII: Conditional Lines: Functions</color>
  <indent><color:G>Function  Explanation</color>
  <color:keyword>IOR</color>     <indent>Inclusive Or: [IOR a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of <color:o>any</color> subexpression a, b, c, ... is TRUE.</indent>
  <color:keyword>OR</color>      <indent>Same as IOR. One day I was puzzled why my [OR ...] expression wasn't working. Also, if you are going to have IOR, it suggests you will have XOR (Exclusive Or) as well, and we don't!</indent>
  <color:keyword>AND</color>     <indent>Logical And: [AND a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of <color:o>all</color> subexpressions a, b, c, ... are TRUE.</indent>
  <color:keyword>NOT</color>     <indent>[NOT a] is TRUE if a is FALSE, and vice versa. Use this when you want to take an action when something is <color:o>not</color> true.</indent>
  <color:keyword>EQU</color>     <indent>[EQU v a b c ...] is TRUE when the value of v is <color:o>one</color> of the values a, b, c, ... Comparison is by string. Typically, you use this with v being a built-in variable expression, like <color:keyword>$CLASS</color> (see below) and the remaining arguments to EQU being strings to test, like <color:keyword>Warrior</color> or <color:keyword>Rogue</color>. Note that string literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain spaces.</indent>
  <color:keyword>LEQ</color>     <indent>[LEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is <color:o>less than or equal to</color> the integer value of a. Note that while EQU treats its arguments as strings, LEQ treats them as numbers.</indent>
  <color:keyword>GEQ</color>     <indent>[GEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is <color:o>greater than or equal to</color> the integer value of a. Note that while EQU treats its arguments as strings, GEQ treats them as numbers. For example, use <color:v>[GEQ $LEVEL 20]</color> to test if the player's current level is greater than, or equal to 20.</indent>
</indent>
<color:B>Table IX: Conditional Lines: Variables</color>
  <indent><color:G>Variable  Explanation</color>
<color:keyword>$RACE</color>     <indent>Returns the name of the player's race. For example, <color:keyword>Snotling</color> or <color:keyword>High-Elf</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$CLASS</color>    <indent>Returns the name of the player's class. For example, <color:keyword>Warrior-Mage</color> or <color:keyword>Mindcrafter</color>. Note, if you are playing in <color:r>Monster</color> mode, then this variable always returns <color:keyword>Monster</color>, while $RACE returns the actual monster race you are playing, such as <color:keyword>Lich</color> or <color:keyword>Dragon</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$REALM1</color>   <indent>Returns the name of the player's first realm, if any. For example, <color:keyword>Chaos</color> or <color:keyword>Sorcery</color>. If the player does not have a first realm, then this variable returns <color:keyword>none</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$REALM2</color>   <indent>Returns the name of the player's second realm, if any. For example, <color:keyword>Life</color> or <color:keyword>Death</color>. If the player does not have a second realm, then this variable returns <color:keyword>none</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$LEVEL</color>    <indent>Returns the player's current level. Typically, you combine this with GEQ or LEQ to test the level against a threshold, such as <color:v>[LEQ $LEVEL 34]</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>$MONEY</color>    <indent>Returns the amount of gold the player has. Like $LEVEL, use this with GEQ or LEQ to test whether your player is rich or poor.</indent>

As mentioned before, all variables begin with a <color:keypress>$</color> character to distinguish them from string literals. Also, note there are other variables like $SYS and $KEYBOARD which I haven't documented.

<color:B>Table X: Conditional Lines: Literals</color>
  <indent><color:G>Literal   Explanation</color>
<color:keyword>Number</color>    <indent>Numbers are written like <color:keyword>105</color> or <color:keyword>32</color>.</indent>
<color:keyword>String</color>    <indent>Strings are written like <color:keyword>High-Mage</color> or <color:keyword>Beholder</color>. Note that string literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain spaces.</indent>

<topic:EasyDestroyer><style:heading>The Easy Destroyer</style>

If, after reading all of the above, you decide that The Mogaminator is too much for you to handle, you may, instead, use a simpler system to manage objects: The Easy Destroyer. I don't recommend this, but the choice is yours. This system is configured via options (see <link:option.txt#AutoDestroyer>). The option destroy_items turns The Easy Destroyer on and off. If you are using The Mogaminator, be sure to turn off The Easy Destroyer, and vice versa. (BTW, you "turn off" The Mogaminator but closing the game and deleting the pickpref-<color:o>NAME</color>.prf file whose location was indicated in the reference section).
