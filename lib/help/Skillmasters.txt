<style:title>Skillmasters</style>

Using a point based skill system, the Skillmaster allows you to design your own class. Upon birth you will receive 5 points to spend. You will gain an additional skill point for every 5 levels of experience (for a total of 15 skill points). You may spend these skill points to gain or improve various skills with the <color:keypress>G</color> command (which is the same command spellcasters use to gain a spell).

To play the Skillmaster effectively, you should have a plan as to which skills you will learn and when. Since there are many more skills to learn than you could possibly hope to acquire with just 15 skill points, and since your skill choices are permanent, you will be stuck with the choices you make. So, unlike a spellcaster that can be assured of eventually learning all spells, you will not be able to play this class effectively without a bit of forethought. This document should help.

<topic:Overview><style:heading>Overview of the Various Skills</style>

The available skills come in various kinds, or groups. You learn individual skills, but the number of points in the corresponding group is sometimes also important. For example, the first group of skills is Melee. Here, you may choose skills to specialize in various classes of melee weapons, or even in bare handed combat (Martial Arts). The total number of points spent in the group determines your overall Melee skill (as shown on the Character Sheet) as well as your starting STR and DEX. On the other hand, the number of points spent in the skill itself determines your proficiency with that particular class of weaponry and also influences how many attacks per round you get. Each skill group is discussed in detail below.

The main skill groups are:

  <color:R>Melee</color>       <indent>Effectiveness in hand to hand combat</indent>

  <color:R>Ranged</color>      <indent>Effectiveness with ranged combat (e.g. Archery)</indent>

  <color:R>Magic</color>       <indent>Access to spell realms as an INT based caster. Every spell realm except Life is available.</indent>

  <color:R>Prayer</color>      <indent>Access to prayer realms as a WIS based caster. Only good and evil realms are available.</indent>

  <color:R>Skills</color>      <indent>Improve basic skills such as Devices, Stealth, Speed and Saving Throw</indent>

  <color:R>Techniques</color>  <indent>Access to advanced or unusual talents that most players lack. This includes some book based talents, such as Burglary, as well as other non-standard talents like Riding and Dual Wielding.</indent>

  <color:R>Abilities</color>   <indent>For a single skill point, you can buy a power like Stone Skin or an ability like Good Luck.</indent>

<topic:Proficiency><style:heading>Proficiency</style>

Before discussing each of the skill groups in detail, it is useful to make a note regarding the proficiency system. As you are aware, normal classes improve in various aspects of the game through practice. This applies to individual weapons and shooters as well as to individual spells. Initially, the player is unskilled with an item or spell, and must practice using it in order to acquire proficiency. Should they change weapons or switch to using a different spell, the process is repeated. In addition, there is also a proficiency system for various broad skills such as riding, dual wielding, and martial arts. If you have ever tried to master these broad skills, then you know it often takes most of the game to learn them.

But the Skillmaster is completely different. Indeed, they do not learn through use and practice. Rather, when they buy into a skill, they instantly acquire proficiency. As an example (of very bad advice), a first level Skillmaster could spend all 5 points in Dual Wielding (or in Riding) and instantly achieve Master level proficiency. Similarly with weapons. The number of points in a particular weapon class sets your proficiency level, and this level never improves ... unless you spend more skill points!

<topic:Melee><style:heading>Melee Skills</style>

Melee skills affect your skill in hand to hand combat. Each skill in this group affects a single class of weapons (swords, polearms, blunt weapons, diggers) or allows bare handed martial arts fighting. To use any particular class of weaponry, you will need some skill. Thus, when investing in melee skills, you must choose whether to specialize in one or two classes of weapons, or whether to spread out your skill. You will be less effective in the latter case, but you will have access to more kinds of weapons (and avoid the frustration of finding awesomely powerful weapons that you can not wield).

The total number of points in this group determines your basic melee skills in the same way that a normal class choice determines melee skills. That is, you get a fixed amount of base melee skill, and an extra amount that improves with level. Warriors are very good fighters; mages, not so much. But you, as a Skillmaster, can improve your melee whenever you choose simply by investing more points in various melee related skills. As a rough guide, consider the following tables:

  <color:R>Melee Group                          Weapon Class</color>
  <color:G>Pts  Relative Skill                  Pts  Proficiency Blows</color>
    0  Mage                              0  Unskilled   4.00
  1-2  Priest                            1  Beginner    5.00
  3-4  Ranger                            2  Skilled     5.25
  5-8  Paladin                           3  Expert      5.50
   9+  Warrior                           4  Master      5.75
                                         5  Master      6.00

Note that Melee and Magic are somewhat antithetical. Investing in Melee also improves your starting STR and DEX, but too many magic points will decrease your STR (and CON). Magic points also decrease the maximum number of blows displayed in the table above (currently, by just 0.05 blows per point, but too much magic will make this effect noticeable). Also, Magic improves INT and your device skill, but too much Melee will have a slight negative effect on both of these.

Each skill in the Melee group should be fairly obvious (except perhaps Martial Arts). Basically, when you wield a melee weapon the game checks the number of skill points in the appropriate group to determine your proficiency and to calculate your number of attacks per round. The individual melee skills are discussed next.

  <indent><topic:Swords><color:o>Swords</color>
Swords are the most common class of weaponry and include the basic Long Sword, Broad Sword, Bastard Sword, and Two-Handed Sword, as well as all the shorter daggers and such. If you look at the proficiency screen (<color:keypress>~P</color>) then swords are all those weapons displayed in the first column. If you are specializing in a particular class of weaponry, then swords and polearms are both good choices. While there are many good blunt weapons, they are not nearly so common as swords and polearms are.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Polearms><color:o>Polearms</color>
Polearms are the next most common class of weaponry and include the Trident, Spear, Lance, and Pike as well as all the Axes. If you look at the proficiency screen (<color:keypress>~P</color>), then all the polearms are listed in the second column. Like swords, if you are specializing, then this is a good class to choose. In addition, if you are building a Riding class, then you really want to choose this skill as well to enable access to the various Lances. In fact, for riding based melee, the Heavy Lance is <color:v>the</color> weapon of choice!</indent>

  <indent><topic:Hafted><color:o>Hafted (Blunt Weapons)</color>
Hafted weapons are currently about half as common as either swords or polearms. The traditional province of the priest, blunt weapons include the Mace, Whip, Club, and War Hammer, as well as various Staves. The most deadly weapon in the game, the Mace of Disruption, is also in this group (see the third column on the proficiency screen for a complete list). But note that unlike the Priest, a Prayer based Skillmaster has <color:v>no</color> weapon restrictions. Still, this group is worth investing in if you want access to general weapon based melee. For example, with 6 total points in melee, investing 2 in each of Swords, Polearms and Hafted is a reasonable balanced approach (Personally, I have trouble resisting 5 in a single class, but that is my own problem and need not be yours as well :).</indent>

  <indent><topic:Diggers><color:o>Diggers</color>
Yes, you can melee with Picks and Shovels if you want, but the weapons in this class are incredibly uncommon when compared to the three main groups. Still, there are a couple of powerful end game diggers and this class of weaponry might be worth a point or two should you find one.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Martial Arts><color:o>Martial Arts</color>
With this skill you may fight monsters using a special, bare-handed combat technique. I assume you've played a Monk before (if not, try one as they are most enjoyable) and this skill allows you access to this powerful mode of combat. If you are building a Martial Artist, then I recommend using the full 5 points for this skill as that will give you 100% monk-like efficiency when choosing types of attacks and critical hits. But compared to the monk, you will get one fewer attack per round.

A few cautions regarding this skill are in order. First, if you fight bare-handed, then you get the normal monk armor restrictions as well as the AC bonus when forgoing various equipment slots (but you do not gain a monk speed boost or access to various postures). These armor restrictions do not apply if you switch to normal weapon based melee. Second, martial arts will not work when mounted so it is a bad idea to waste your precious skill points on Riding when building a martial arts based class.</indent>

<topic:Ranged><style:heading>Ranged Skills</style>

Ranged skills include Archery and Throwing. As a group, the total number of points affects your Ranged skill, as displayed on the Character Sheet. However, with only 2 skills in this group, it is usual that you should treat Archery and Throwing as mutually exclusive talents.

  <indent><topic:Archery><color:o>Archery</color>
With this skill, you gain proficiency with Slings, Bows and Crossbows. Each point grants enhanced proficiency with all missile weapons (contrast this with Melee skills which require you to specialize). With 2 or more points of Archery, you will begin to gain extra shots per round as well as reduced breakage odds for your missiles. You will never be so good as an Archer though with a full 5 points of Archery you can shoot just as well as a Ranger (and use Slings and Crossbows too, which a Ranger can not). This skill also increases your stealth.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Throwing><color:o>Throwing</color>
With this skill, you will gain the power of <color:keyword>Throw Weapon</color> which allows you to effectively throw your leading melee weapon. The range of this talent depends exclusively on your STR and the weight of the weapon. The damage, however, depends on both the weapon (and any slays it might have) as well as on your STR and the amount of Throwing skill you have. In addition, with enough throwing skill, you may use this talent more quickly, allowing you to throw your weapon more than once per round.

Weapon throwing is not like Archery. For one thing, your weapon will often return to you after striking a foe. With more skill, this return effect can become (almost) certain. Also, you may catch the weapon upon return with the same hand which threw it, effectively re-equipping the weapon in a single, graceful, fluid motion. With more skill, catching the return weapon becomes more likely, though this depends on DEX as well. With a high enough DEX and a full amount of Throwing skill, you can be (almost) certain to recover your weapon, fully equipped, after each toss. However, you should always be prepared for an occasional failure, no matter how skilled you are (i.e., carry a spare weapon!).

The damage of your thrown weapon can be formidable. As your skill improves, so does the damage multiplier of the toss. Throwing weapons functions very much like normal archery, except <color:v>you</color> are the shooter. This means that you supply the damage multiplier (based upon your skill) and this multiplier is scaled slightly by STR just like with normal shooters. And the weapon is the missile ... Damage is calculated as with archery, using the damage dice of the projectile, applying any slays, adding in the damage bonus of the weapon and then multiplying everything together to get a nice, tasty sum. You can view the details in the <color:keyword>Throwing</color> section of your Character Sheet. But you should know that, in general, your other equipment will not affect the damage of thrown weapons. Rings of Combat and even Rings of Archery do not boost damage (though the latter does boost accuracy). Also, rings that grant weaponmastery (i.e. increased damage dice) or elemental slays will have no effect. This is a bit sad, but, on the other hand, you can change your equipment preferences with this knowledge in mind, perhaps assuming a more defensive posture than you otherwise would.</indent>

<topic:Magic><style:heading>Magic Skills</style>

Each skill in the Magic group grants access to a single realm of book based spellcasting. This realm will use INT as your spellcasting stat for purposes of fail rates. Usually, you will also use INT as your mana stat, but this can be complicated if you learn Prayer skills or other magical Techniques. With INT based mana comes normal magelike glove encumbrance as well as the ability to benefit from wizardstaves and certain magical jewelry (This requires 5 points overall in the magic group).

With just a single point in a given realm, you will be a poor caster. In general, the more points you invest in a given realm, the better a caster you will become. You will gain access to more spells and be able to cast them at a lower level of experience. The casting costs and fail rates will both diminish with each point of skill. Also, your minimum fail rate will go down (And you know how annoying 5% fail rates can be, don't you?). As a rule of thumb, you will need a full 5 points in a given realm to cast (almost) as well as a Mage would.

But, aside from this, there are no restrictions on which realms you may learn, and you can learn as many different realms as you like. You don't learn individual spells the way a mage might but can cast any spell in a known realm provided you have the book and your level is high enough. Finally, you need not worry about spell proficiency. As discussed above, the proficiency system does not apply to the Skillmaster.

See <link:magic.txt#MagicRealms> for the various magic realms. One final comment: The Life realm is not available as a Magic skill. Instead, to gain access to Life you must learn it as a Prayer skill.

The total number of points in this group determines your class skill with devices. However, for mage-like device skill, you will also need to invest in <color:keyword>Skills/Devices</color>. Your starting INT is also directly influenced by the total number of points in this group. Unfortunately, Magic impedes Melee skill, and too much magic will adversely affect your starting STR and CON.

<topic:Prayer><style:heading>Prayer Skills</style>

Prayer skills are like Magic skills in that each one grants access to a single realm of spellcasting. However, there are many differences. For one thing, each Prayer realm uses WIS as the spellcasting stat. As an overall Prayer caster, you will also use WIS as your mana stat and won't be subject to mage-like glove encumbrance. You can use wizardstaves with just 5 overall points in this group (provided it is your primary spellcasting group).

Another difference is that selection of realms in this group is extremeley limited, consisting of just those realms that are either good (Life and Crusade) or evil (Death and Daemon). Life magic is uniquely available as a Prayer skill. For the other realms, they can also be learned as Magic skills. However, the game will not allow you to learn a single realm as both a Prayer and as Magic, so you need to pick whether to use INT or WIS for these 3 realms.

The total number of points in this group determines your class saving throw skill as shown on the Character Sheet. You can also improve your saving throw by directly investing in <color:keyword>Skills/Magic Resistance</color>. Your total Prayer points also determines your starting WIS.

A final contrast between Magic and Prayer is that points in this group do not decrease your STR and CON the way Magic does. They do not diminish your maximum number of melee attacks either. However, Prayer has only a very small influence on device skills, so you might need to directly invest in <color:keyword>Skills/Devices</color> when a Magic caster would not.

As mentioned above, a Prayer caster is not a priest. There are no weapon restrictions on this class so you can gleefully slice and dice while piously enjoying Life prayers. You can also freely mix good and evil realms like Life and Death, whereas a priest may not.

<topic:Skills><style:heading>Miscellaneous Skills</style>

This group contains the remaining player skills as well as a couple of skills that influence stats. Unlike the previous groups, the total number of points in this group has no effect on your class. The skills in this group each allow a maximum of 3 points to be invested. Since they are not primary skills like melee, you should invest in these skills sparingly in order to flesh out your character design (e.g. by adding a bit more stealth or device skills).

  <indent><topic:Agility><color:o>Agility</color>
This skill directly improves your starting DEX and also determines your class <color:keyword>Disarming</color> skill, as displayed on the Character Sheet. By default, the Skillmaster will disarm about as well as a priest. If you feel this is not enough then you should invest an additional point or two here. The only other skill that influences disarming is the <color:keyword>Burglary</color> technique discussed below.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Awareness><color:o>Awareness</color>
This skill determines your class <color:keyword>Searching</color> and <color:keyword>Perception</color> skills, as displayed on the Character Sheet. At the moment, these skills are rather unimportant for game play, except in the early game (but that may change some day). Eventually, all players can magically detect traps and doors. To compensate, <color:keyword>Awareness</color> also gives direct benefits depending upon the number of points invested, including faster pseudo-id and see invisible (1); automatic pseudo-id (2); and finally a telepathic awareness of nearby monsters (3).</indent>

  <indent><topic:Devices><color:o>Devices</color>
Skill with magic devices is extremely important for most players. The difference between being able to reliably use a staff of healing and not can be the difference between life and death. By default your <color:keyword>Device</color> skill is primarily determined by the number of points spent in the <color:keyword>Magic</color> group. A small positive influence is also granted for <color:keyword>Prayer</color> skills as well as learning the <color:keyword>Sorcery</color> realm. <color:keyword>Melee</color> points have a small negative influence on device skills. Overall, a Skillmaster can never equal the magical proficiency of a mage unless they also directly invest in this skill for an additional enhancement. If you never learn any magic skills, then you probably better invest at least a point here as well (depending also on your race and personality).</indent>

  <indent><topic:Health><color:o>Health</color>
This skill determines your class <color:keyword>Life Rating</color> which, as you know, is used to scale the number of hit points you get. By default, you begin with a 100% Life Rating which is the same as a Priest. This value goes <color:v>down</color> as you learn <color:keyword>Magic</color> skills (to simulate a Mage-like player). If you want more hit points, or if you wish to undo the negative health effects of too many magic skills, then you should directly invest in this skill. Also, investing in <color:keyword>Health</color> enhances your CON.

Note that while it is true that CON and Life Rating are not really influential until later in the game, buying health also influences the distribution algorithm for your extra hit points. If you've ever played a Mage, and then followed up with a Warrior, then you have some idea about what this means. Every class receives a fixed number of hit points (in addition to the randomly rolled portion), but this fixed amount is allocated by level differently, from linearly in the case of a warrior, to cubically in the case of a mage. Other classes blend these two extremes. For the skillmaster, your melee skills increase the linear aspects of this distribution while your magic skills increase the cubic aspect (Archery and Prayers increase the quadratic weight). So if you are heavy into magic, your hit point progression will become more mage-like (though not quite so bad), and you can offset this with some mid-game Health. Of course, in the end, all players reach level 50 and the extra hit point progression ceases to matter.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Magic Resistance><color:o>Magic Resistance</color>
This skill increases your <color:keyword>Saving Throw</color> as shown on the Character Sheet. By default, you will have an average saving throw unless you invest in <color:keyword>Prayer</color> skills. To further increase your saving throw, you might want to spend a point on this skill as well.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Speed><color:o>Speed</color>
This skill directly increases your speed. Arguably, speed is one of the most important attributes in the game ... until you have enough at least. In the early game, speed can be very useful. If you plan on investing in this skill at all, you should probably do so very early on. Each point in this skill will increase your speed by <color:G>+2</color>.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Stealth><color:o>Stealth</color>
This skill directly increases your <color:keyword>Stealth</color> as displayed on the Character Sheet. By default, the Skillmaster has absolutely terrible stealth ... even worse than a warrior. Both <color:keyword>Archery</color> and <color:keyword>Burglary</color> directly increase stealth a bit. But if you aren't investing in those skills, or if you want even more stealth, then you should spend some points here. Each point invested in this skill increases your stealth by <color:G>+3</color>. A single point will make you as stealthy as a mage while two points will make you slightly more stealthy than a rogue. With three points you will be very stealthy indeed. So much so that you can often gain powerful sneak attacks on sleeping monsters.</indent>

<topic:Techniques><style:heading>Techniques</style>

Techniques are specialty skills. By default, most players can not access these skills unless they choose a specific class. For example, <color:keyword>Riding</color> should only be seriously contemplated by Cavalry or Beastmaster characters. But the Skillmaster also may learn these techniques, often in powerful combination with other skills. You may invest up to five points in each technique in this group. The total number of points in this group has no gameplay effects.

  <indent><topic:Burglary><color:o>Burglary</color>
Normally restricted to the Rogue, Burglary is a spellbook based technique using DEX as the primary stat. This realm functions like the other realms in <color:keyword>Magic</color> and <color:keyword>Prayer</color> in the sense that the number of points invested here determines each spell's level, cost and fail rate. You will need a full five points to match a rogue in burglary! This skill also increases your stealth and your disarming skills. See <link:magic.txt#Burglary> for more information.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Dual Wielding><color:o>Dual Wielding</color>
The Dual Wielding skill allows effective melee with two weapons at once and is inspired by the famous dual sword technique created by Miyamoto Musashi. By investing in this skill, you will instantly increase your proficiency with this powerful combat technique. Obviously, you should combine this skill generously with <color:keyword>Melee</color> talents.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Riding><color:o>Riding</color>
With this technique, you may ride pet monsters into battle. Each point invested in this skill immediately increases your riding proficiency which is important for your speed in combat as well as your ability to ride more powerful mounts. Without adequate skill, you will be tossed frequently during battle, especially after taking a substantial amount of damage. Full mastery in riding requires five points in this skill, though you might be able to get by with just four. Note that <color:keyword>Martial Arts</color> is not possible while mounted. See <link:monster.txt#Pets> for more information.</indent>

<topic:Abilities><style:heading>Abilities</style>

Finally, as a Skillmaster you may invest a single point in any of the following skills to gain a single power or ability. Unlike normal race and class powers, any power related skill in this group is available for immediate use without any mana cost and (usually) without any fail rate. For example, you may buy the power of <color:keyword>Stone Skin</color> on level one and use it right away. As you probably know, Stone Skin is also available in both Craft and Nature spell realms, and you could have invested a point in either of these realms instead. So, in addition to getting your Stone Skin as a spell, you could cast many other spells as well. But delayed gratification is the problem ... with the realm approach, you would need to find your third spellbook and it would be a long time indeed before you got to cast your Stone Skin spell. Other powers in this group, such as <color:keyword>Create Ammo</color> or <color:keyword>Eat Magic</color> have no such spellcasting alternative and are uniquely accessible as an ability.

The other types of abilities grant a passive talent, such as <color:keyword>Regeneration</color> or <color:keyword>Good Luck</color>. Since they only cost a single skill point, they are worthy of consideration for fleshing out your character design.

  <indent><topic:Clear Mind><color:o>Clear Mind</color>
This power regenerates a very small amount of mana on each usage and aids a spellcaster to recover their mana faster than resting alone. With this power, the game will automatically activate it for you while resting to save your typing fingers.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Create Ammo><color:o>Create Ammo</color>
Normally restricted to the Archer, this talent allows you to create missiles from junk objects in the dungeon. You may create shots from rubble; arrows from skeletons and broken sticks; and bolts from skeletons. The quality of the ammo so created depends only upon your character level.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Eat Magic><color:o>Eat Magic</color>
The power of Eat Magic allows you to drain mana from your devices to replenish your spell pool. Unlike the other powers in this group, there is always a significant fail rate and even if you succeed in activating this power, you may still fail to drain mana from the target device. You might even destroy the device in the process! Nevertheless, Eat Magic is very useful for end game spellcasters since monsters always have many times more hit points then your mana can damage. For some foes, resting to recover mana before re-engaging may be too slow and it is frustrating to return to battle only to discovery your enemy back at full health!</indent>

  <indent><topic:Good Luck><color:o>Good Luck</color>
With this ability, you will have slightly better odds of finding excellent items. Even artifacts, especially the rare ones, are easier to find. But note that some players are lucky even without this ability (and vice versa).</indent>

  <indent><topic:Loremastery><color:o>Loremastery</color>
This ability grants automatic, instantaneous identification of objects as you step over them. If you find the loot identification subgame annoying, with its impossibly slow pseudo-id and difficult to cast early-game identify spells, then spend a point here.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Massacre><color:o>Massacre</color>
This power allows you to attack each and every adjacent monster with your normal melee attacks. If you find yourself frequently surrounded by orcs, hounds and trolls, they can be more efficiently dispatched when you can kill them by eights instead of by ones!</indent>

  <indent><topic:Noctovision><color:o>Noctovision</color>
This power allows you to see in the dark without the use of a torch or lantern. With this ability, you will be able to equip <color:keyword>Dark Stones</color>. In addition, you will be able to explore large darkened cavern rooms without the need to illuminate the room first, which often wakes monsters up. This ability is a good choice for stealthy characters.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Panic Hit><color:o>Panic Hit</color>
With this power you will understand how thieves feel. After attacking an adjacent enemy with your normal melee attacks, you will be teleported a short way off. This is very useful in situations where you need to teleport anyway since you get to land some additional damage in the process. But know this: sometimes you will fail to escape. Thus, if you are on death's door then you better not attempt to rely on Panic Hit (quaff some healing instead).</indent>

  <indent><topic:Regeneration><color:o>Regeneration</color>
This ability allows you to more quickly recover both hit points and spell points. It is slightly more powerful than normal regeneration so you can stop your chuckling over my having included this in the list :)</indent>

  <indent><topic:Resistance><color:o>Resistance</color>
This power grants temporary resistance to the basic elemental attacks of acid, fire, cold, electricity and poison. Your resistances stack, as you know, so having multiple sources of the same protection can be useful both in protecting you and in protecting your gear.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Rodeo><color:o>Rodeo</color>
This power allows you to attempt to forcibly mount an unfriendly monster. If successful, you may tame yourself a new mount to ride. But often such an attempt ends in utter humiliation. Perhaps you've heard a certain saying?</indent>

  <indent><topic:Rush Attack><color:o>Rush Attack</color>
This power allows you to leap in to attack nearby monsters, all in a single action.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Stone Skin><color:o>Stone Skin</color>
This power temporarily grants increased armor class, making you harder to hit and harder to damage in melee combat. The amount of protection increases with your experience level. If you plan on defeating the <color:keyword>Serpent of Chaos</color> with melee, then this would be a very useful ability to have.</indent>
