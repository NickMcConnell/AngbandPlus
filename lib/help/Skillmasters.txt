<style:title>Skillmasters</style>

Using a point-based skill system, the Skillmaster allows you to design your own class. You receive 5 <color:keyword>skill points</color> to spend immediately upon birth, and will gain an additional point every 5 character levels, for a total of 15 points. You may spend these skill points to gain or improve various skills with the <color:keypress>G</color>ain command.

To be effective as a Skillmaster, you should have a plan as to which skills you will learn and when; your skill choices are permanent, and there are many more skills to learn than you could possibly hope to acquire with just 15 skill points, so make sure you won't be stuck with choices you regret. A bit of forethought is needed; this document should help.

<topic:Overview><style:heading>Overview of the Various Skills</style>

The available <color:keyword>skills</color> come in various kinds, or <color:keyword>groups</color>. You invest points in individual skills, not in groups, but the overall number of points for the corresponding group is sometimes also important. For example, the first group of skills is <color:keyword>Melee</color>; here, you may specialize in various melee-weapon classes or learn bare-handed combat (Martial Arts). The total number of points spent in this group determines your overall Melee skill (as shown on the Character Sheet) and even affects your STR and DEX. On the other hand, the number of points spent in the skill itself determines your proficiency with that particular class of weaponry, and also influences how many attacks per round you get. Each skill group is discussed in detail below.

The main skill groups are:

  <color:R>Melee</color>       <indent>Effectiveness in hand-to-hand combat</indent>
  <color:R>Ranged</color>      <indent>Effectiveness in ranged combat (archery and throws)</indent>
  <color:R>Magic</color>       <indent>Access to spell realms as an INT-based caster. Every spell realm except Life is available.</indent>
  <color:R>Prayer</color>      <indent>Access to prayer realms as a WIS-based caster. Only good and evil realms are available.</indent>
  <color:R>Skills</color>      <indent>Basic skills such as Devices, Stealth, Speed and Saving Throw</indent>
  <color:R>Techniques</color>  <indent>Access to advanced or unusual talents that most players lack. This includes some book-based talents, such as Burglary and Kendo, as well as non-standard talents like Riding and Dual Wielding.</indent>
  <color:R>Abilities</color>   <indent>For a single skill point, you can buy a power like Stone Skin or an ability like Good Luck.</indent>

<topic:Proficiency><style:heading>Proficiency</style>

Before discussing each of the skill groups in detail, it helps to understand the proficiency system. It is explained in detail at <link:prof.txt>, but the short version is: the game has several different proficiency systems, all of which are closely related; other classes' proficiency usually starts at a very low level, improves through use and practice, and is indicated through the five broad tiers <color:G>[Un]skilled</color>, <color:G>[Be]ginner</color>, <color:G>[Sk]illed</color>, <color:G>[Ex]pert</color> and <color:G>[Ma]ster</color>.

But Skillmasters are very different; they do not learn through use and practice. When Skillmasters spend a skill point, they instantly acquire proficiency; as an example (of very bad advice), a level 1 Skillmaster could spend all 5 points in Riding and instantly achieve Master-level proficiency. The same goes for weapons: <color:y>spending points is the only way to gain proficiency</color> (even the Weapon Versatility demigod talent is not available). Skillmasters are [Un]skilled in everything they haven't spent points in, and [Ma]ster in everything they have spent five points in, but the tiers in between vary a bit.

<topic:Melee><style:heading>Melee Skills</style>

Melee skills affect your skill in hand-to-hand combat. Each skill in this group improves your <color:keyword>proficiency</color> either with a single class of weapons (swords, polearms, hafted weapons, diggers) or in bare-handed fighting, and also affects how many <color:keyword>blows</color> you can get per round. To use any particular class of weaponry, you will need some skill. Thus, when investing in melee skills, you must choose whether to be really good with one or two weapon classes or decently good with all of them.

The total number of points in this group determines your basic <color:keyword>Melee skill</color> in the same way your class choice normally would. That is, you get a fixed amount of base Melee skill, and an extra amount that improves with level; warriors get plenty, mages not so much; but you, as a Skillmaster, can improve your melee whenever you choose simply by investing more points in various melee related skills. As a rough guide, consider the following tables:

  <color:R>Melee Group                          Weapon Class</color>
  <color:G>Pts  Relative Skill                  Pts  Proficiency Blows</color>
    0  Mage                              0  Unskilled   4.00
  1-2  Priest                            1  Beginner    5.00
  3-4  Ranger                            2  Skilled     5.25
  5-8  Paladin                           3  Expert      5.50
   9+  Warrior                           4  Master      5.75
                                         5  Master      6.00

<color:y>Note that Melee and Magic are somewhat antithetical.</color> Investing in Melee also improves your STR and DEX, but too many magic points will decrease your STR (and CON). Magic points also decrease the maximum number of blows displayed in the table above (by just 0.05 blows per point, but too much magic will make this effect noticeable). Also, Magic improves your INT and device skill, but too much Melee will have a slight negative effect on both of these. 

The individual melee skills are discussed next.

  <indent><topic:Swords><color:o>Swords</color>
Swords (<color:W>|</color>) are the most common class of weaponry and include swords, daggers, blades of chaos and all other weapons listed under <color:keyword>swords</color> in the <color:keypress>~P</color> proficiency menu. Swords and polearms are the most obvious choices if you wish to specialize in a particular class of weaponry, due to their commonness.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Polearms><color:o>Polearms</color>
Polearms (<color:o>/</color>) are the second-most common class of weaponry and include tridents, spears, lances, axes and all other weapons listed under <color:keyword>polearms</color> in the <color:keypress>~P</color> proficiency menu. This is a good skill to invest in if you are building a Riding skillmaster, since Lances and Heavy Lances are perfectly suited for riding melee.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Hafted><color:o>Hafted (Blunt Weapons)</color>
Hafted weapons (<color:U>\</color>) are less common than swords or polearms, but include the deadly Maces of Disruption and some exceptional artifacts like the Staff of Asclepius (again, see <color:keypress>~P</color> for the full list). Note that prayer-based skillmasters have no weapon restrictions, and so don't need hafted weapons like normal priests do; still, this group is worth investing in if you want general access to weapon-based melee, or just have faith that a great hafted weapon will drop.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Diggers><color:o>Diggers</color>
Yes, you can melee with Picks and Shovels if you want, but the weapons in this class are incredibly uncommon when compared to the three main groups; there are a couple of powerful end-game diggers, but realistically this is an option for deliberate challenge runs.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Martial Arts><color:o>Martial Arts</color>
With this skill you may fight monsters using a special, bare-handed combat technique. Skillmasters who invest a full 5 points in martial arts will be almost as effective in combat as a monk; the only difference is that your blows per round are marginally lower.

A few cautions regarding this skill are in order, though. If you fight bare-handed, you also get the monk armor weight restrictions, but will not gain the monk speed boost or access to various postures. (The armor restrictions stop applying if you switch back to weapon-based melee.) In addition, martial arts will not work when mounted, and Kendo techniques require a melee weapon to work.</indent>

<topic:Ranged><style:heading>Ranged Skills</style>

Ranged skills include Archery and Throwing. As a group, the total number of points affects your Archery skill, as displayed on the Character Sheet; yet most players treat Archery and Throwing as mutually exclusive talents.

  <indent><topic:Archery><color:o>Archery</color>
This skill improves your proficiency with all of Slings, Bows and Crossbows (unlike Melee, this skill does not require you to specialize in only one weapon type). With 2 or more points of Archery, you begin to gain extra shots per round, as well as reduced breakage odds for your missiles. You will never be quite as good as a specialist Archer, but then specialist Archers don't get 10 skill points to spend elsewhere... This skill also increases your stealth.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Throwing><color:o>Throwing</color>
This skill gives you the special power of <color:keyword>Throw Weapon</color>, which allows you to use your leading melee weapon as a throwing weapon. The range of a throw depends exclusively on your STR and the weight of the weapon; the damage depends on the weapon (and any slays it might have), your STR, and your Throwing skill. Investing enough points in Throwing also improves your throwing speed.

A thrown weapon will often <color:keyword>return</color> to you after striking a foe; with enough skill, this return effect becomes very likely. You even have a chance to catch the returning weapon with the same hand which threw it, effectively re-equipping the weapon in a single, graceful, fluid motion; this also becomes more likely with more skill, but depends on your DEX as well. With a high enough DEX and full Throwing skill, you can be <color:keyword>almost</color> certain to recover your weapon, fully equipped, after each toss... however, you should always be prepared for an occasional failure, no matter how skilled you are. So, <color:y>carry a spare weapon!</color>

The damage from a thrown weapon can be formidable; as your skill improves, so does the damage multiplier of the toss. Throwing functions much like archery, except <color:v>you</color> are the shooter and supply the damage multiplier through your skill; as with normal shooters, the multiplier is scaled slightly by STR. And the weapon is the projectile... Damage is calculated very similarly to archery, using the damage dice of the weapon thrown, applying any slays, adding in the damage bonus of the weapon and then multiplying everything together to get a nice, tasty sum. You can view the details in the <color:keyword>Throwing</color> section of your Character Sheet. Note, though, that most off-weapon boosts will not apply to throwing; Rings of Archery and a few other items can boost your accuracy, but that's pretty much it.</indent>

<topic:Magic><style:heading>Magic Skills</style>

Each skill in the Magic group grants access to a single <color:keyword>spellbook realm</color>. The realm will use INT as your spellcasting stat (usually this means INT will also determine the size of your mana pool, but that gets more complicated if you also learn Techniques or Prayer skills). With INT-based mana comes mage-like <color:keyword>glove encumbrance</color>; but if you invest at least 5 overall points in magic, you also gain the mage ability to benefit from <color:keyword>cheap-spell</color> and <color:keyword>easy-spell</color> items like Wizardstaves.

With just a single point in a given realm, you will be a poor caster; investing more points helps a Skillmaster even more than proficiency normally helps casters, in that it reduces not only the mana cost but also the level of the spell. Your minimum fail rates also go down with points invested; only a full 5-point investment allows 0% fail. 

See <link:magic.txt#MagicRealms> for a list of the various spellbook realms. The Life realm is not available as a Magic skill (only as a Prayer skill); but apart from this you can learn all book realms, and can study as many different realms as you like. You do not need to learn individual spells; you can cast any spell in a studied realm, provided you have the book and your level is high enough.

Spending points in this group boosts your class Device skill, although not as much as direct investment in <color:keyword>Skills/Devices</color>. Your INT is also directly influenced by the total number of points in this group. <color:y>Magic makes you squishy and bad at melee;</color> too much magic will adversely affect your STR, CON and life rating multiplier and reduce your maximum blows per round. However, studying Craft magic boosts your melee a bit.

<topic:Prayer><style:heading>Prayer Skills</style>

Prayer skills are like Magic skills in that each one grants access to a single spellbook realm; but Prayer realms use WIS, not INT, as the spellcasting stat. As with Magic, investing 5 points in the Prayer group lets you benefit from cheap-spell (Dm) and easy-spell (Es) items; but here you don't have to worry about glove encumbrance, unless you have invested at least equally in Magic.

The downside is that the selection of realms is more limited; only the good realms (Life/Crusade) and evil realms (Death/Daemon) are available through the Prayer group. Note that Crusade, Death and Daemon are also offered by Magic; you can learn them as either WIS-based Prayer realms or INT-based Magic realms, but not both.

Investing points in the Prayer group boosts your Saving Throw, though not as much as direct investment in <color:keyword>Skills/Magic Resistance</color>. Investment in Prayer skills also boosts your WIS; unlike Magic, this group does not come with any stat or melee penalties.

As mentioned above, Prayer skillmasters are not priests, so there are no weapon restrictions. You can gleefully slice and dice while piously enjoying Life prayers; if you wish, you can even freely mix good realms with evil realms.

<topic:Skills><style:heading>Miscellaneous Skills</style>

This group contains a number of skills that influence your character attributes. These skills each allow a maximum of 3 points to be invested. Invest here to flesh out your character design.

  <indent><topic:Agility><color:o>Agility</color>
This skill directly improves your DEX and also determines your class <color:keyword>Disarming</color> skill, as displayed on the Character Sheet. (By default, the Skillmaster will disarm about as well as a priest.) The only other skill that influences disarming is the <color:keyword>Burglary</color> technique discussed below.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Awareness><color:o>Awareness</color>
This skill determines your class <color:keyword>Searching</color> and <color:keyword>Perception</color> skills, as displayed on the Character Sheet. Since these are two of the least important primary skills, <color:keyword>Awareness</color> also gives additional benefits to compensate. These depend on the number of points invested: see invisible and faster pseudo-ID (1); automatic ID (2); and finally a telepathic awareness of nearby monsters (3).</indent>

  <indent><topic:Devices><color:o>Devices</color>
Skill with magic devices is extremely important for most players: the difference between being able to reliably use a Staff of Healing and not can be the difference between life and death. By default your <color:keyword>Device</color> skill is primarily determined by the number of points spent in the <color:keyword>Magic</color> group; a small positive influence is also granted for <color:keyword>Prayer</color> skills as well as learning the <color:keyword>Sorcery</color> realm, but <color:keyword>Melee</color> points have a small negative influence on device skills. If you never learn any magic skills, it may be worth investing at least a point here, depending on your race and personality.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Health><color:o>Health</color>
This skill directly improves your CON and also determines your class <color:keyword>base HP</color> and <color:keyword>life rating multiplier</color>; by default Skillmasters have a 100% multiplier, but investment in Magic skills slightly reduces it. If you want more hit points, or wish to undo the negative health effects of too many magic skills, invest in this skill. 

A quick note on HP distribution. Even independently of their higher life rating multipliers, Warriors gain HP much faster than Mages; the Mage HP progression is very late-game-heavy. Investing in Health (or Melee) makes your HP progression more warrior-like, while investing in Magic makes it more mage-like (investing in Archery or Prayers encourages an in-between HP progression, which is also the default). By the time you reach level 50 it all evens out, but in the mid-game the progression makes quite a difference.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Magic Resistance><color:o>Magic Resistance</color>
This skill increases your <color:keyword>Saving Throw</color>; a couple points here and some <color:keyword>Prayer</color> investment, and you will be almost immune to evil curses.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Speed><color:o>Speed</color>
Each point in this skill increases your speed by <color:G>+2</color>. Speed is very important, especially in the early game; so if you plan to invest here, you should probably do so quite early. (Too bad there are so many other things you also want to invest in early...)</indent>

  <indent><topic:Stealth><color:o>Stealth</color>
This skill directly increases your <color:keyword>Stealth</color>. By default, Skillmasters have absolutely terrible stealth... both <color:keyword>Archery</color> and <color:keyword>Burglary</color> increase stealth a bit, but even if you are investing in one or both of those, spending points here as well can still help. Each point invested in this skill increases your stealth by <color:G>+3</color>; a single point will make you as stealthy as a mage, while two points make you slightly stealthier than a rogue. With three points you will be so stealthy you often gain powerful sneak attacks on sleeping monsters.</indent>

<topic:Techniques><style:heading>Techniques</style>

Techniques are speciality skills otherwise limited to one or two classes. For example, only Samurai can learn <color:keyword>Kendo</color>; and while <color:keyword>Riding</color> is more generally open, only Cavalry and Beastmasters are really good at it. But Skillmasters may also learn these techniques, often in powerful combination with other skills. You may invest up to five points in each technique in this group; the total number of points in this group has no gameplay effects.

  <indent><topic:Burglary><color:o>Burglary</color>
Normally restricted to the Rogue, Burglary (<link:magic.txt#Burglary>) is a spellbook realm that uses DEX as the primary stat. This realm functions much like the normal realms in <color:keyword>Magic</color> and <color:keyword>Prayer</color>, and you need to invest a full five points to match a rogue in burglary. Burglary skill also improves your stealth and your disarming skills.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Kendo><color:o>Kendo</color>
Normally available only to Samurai, Kendo is a book-based technique that enhances melee combat. Indeed, in order to use any Kendo technique you must wield a melee weapon (so do <color:v>not</color> try to combine this skill with <color:keyword>Martial Arts</color>). Kendo techniques have no fail rates.

Learning this skill changes your mana to behave like that of the Samurai: your max resting mana is very small and determined solely by your WIS, but using the special <color:keyword>Concentration</color> class power temporarily boosts your mana pool. Boosted mana decays rather quickly with each turn, so you must time your concentration carefully before engaging an enemy in battle, and then hurry to defeat your foe before your mana runs out.

Unlike real Samurai, <color:y>Kendo skillmasters must carry the books around</color> to access the various techniques. Note that if you mix Kendo with other spell realms, the Samurai mana mechanics have priority; this can be convenient at times (you can regain mana quickly if you have time to concentrate), but inconvenient at other times (Restore Mana becomes less effective, and your mana pool even after concentration is not all that large). As a final insult, Kendo mana mechanics block all cheap-spell and easy-spell effects except realm stones. 

Investment in Kendo should generally be combined with investment in <color:keyword>Melee</color>. Kendo techniques make your attacks more powerful, but you still need to hit monsters in order to benefit...</indent>

  <indent><topic:Dual Wielding><color:o>Dual Wielding</color>
The Dual Wielding skill, pioneered by Miyamoto Musashi, allows effective melee with two weapons at once. Investment in this skill increases your dual-wielding proficiency; but like Kendo, this skill should also be combined with <color:keyword>Melee</color> talents.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Riding><color:o>Riding</color>
With this technique, you may ride your pets into battle. Each point invested in Riding immediately increases your riding proficiency, which affects your riding speed as well as your ability to ride more powerful mounts. Without adequate skill you will be tossed frequently, especially after taking a substantial amount of damage (which of course is the least convenient time for it). Full riding mastery requires five points in this skill, though you might be able to get by with just four. Investment in Riding also makes you more effective at using Capture Balls. <color:y>Note that unarmed combat is not possible while mounted.</color> See <link:prof.txt#Riding> and <link:monster.txt#Pets> for more information.</indent>

<topic:Abilities><style:heading>Abilities</style>

Finally, you may invest a single point in any of the following skills to gain a single power or talent. Unlike normal race and class powers, powers gained through these skills are available for immediate use without any mana cost and (usually) without any fail rate. For example, you may buy the power of <color:keyword>Stone Skin</color> on level one and use it right away. Stone Skin is also available as a spell in the Craft and Nature realms, but then you'd have to level up, find the right spellbooks and spend mana... Other powers in this group, such as <color:keyword>Create Ammo</color> or <color:keyword>Eat Magic</color>, have no such spellcasting alternative and are accessible only through the Abilities group.

Not all Abilities give powers; some grant a passive talent, such as <color:keyword>Regeneration</color> or <color:keyword>Good Luck</color>. Since Ability skills only cost a single point each, they are a cheap way to flesh out your character.

  <indent><topic:Clear Mind><color:o>Clear Mind</color>
This power regenerates a small amount of mana on each usage, helping spellcasters recover mana more rapidly. To save your typing fingers, the game automatically activates Clear Mind every turn when you rest.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Create Ammo><color:o>Create Ammo</color>
Normally restricted to Archers, this talent allows you to create missiles from junk objects in the dungeon. You may create shots from rubble, arrows from skeletons and broken sticks, and bolts from skeletons; the quality of such ammo depends on your character level.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Eat Magic><color:o>Eat Magic</color>
This power allows you to drain mana from devices to replenish your mana pool. Unlike the other powers in this group, Eat Magic can fail; and even if you succeed in activating the power itself, you may still fail to drain mana from the target device. You might even destroy the device in the process! Nevertheless, Eat Magic can be useful for endgame spellcasters; it directly competes with Clear Mind in the mana-regaining stakes, offering a faster but more expensive and unreliable alternative.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Good Luck><color:o>Good Luck</color>
With this ability, you will have slightly better odds of finding excellent items; even artifacts, especially rare ones, become easier to find. Note that this ability does not stack with the Lucky aura.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Loremastery><color:o>Loremastery</color>
This ability grants automatic, instantaneous identification of objects as you step over them. Spend a point here to save an inventory slot if you lack Identify spells or find them too slow.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Massacre><color:o>Massacre</color>
This power allows you to simultaneously attack each and every adjacent monster with your normal melee attacks. If you find yourself frequently surrounded by enemies, it helps if you can dispatch them by eights instead of ones!</indent>

  <indent><topic:Panic Hit><color:o>Panic Hit</color>
A power familiar to thieves and ninjas: in a single turn, you attack an adjacent enemy with your normal melee attacks and then teleport away. This is very useful in situations where you'd like to teleport anyway, as you get to land some additional damage in the process; but watch out, as the teleport has a chance to fail. High Disarming skill will improve your odds, but you can never fully rely on Panic Hit as an escape.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Regeneration><color:o>Regeneration</color>
This ability simply gives <color:G>+150%</color> to regeneration, allowing you to recover both hit points and spell points much faster.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Resistance><color:o>Resistance</color>
This power grants temporary resistance to the base elements acid, fire, cold, electricity and poison. Having no-cost resistance available on demand helps protect both you and your inventory, and reduces the need to get full 65% base resistance from your equipment.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Rodeo><color:o>Rodeo</color>
This power, otherwise exclusive to Cavalry, allows you to attempt to forcibly mount an unfriendly monster. If successful, you may tame yourself a new mount to ride; but often such an attempt ends in utter humiliation.</indent>

  <indent><topic:Stone Skin><color:o>Stone Skin</color>
This power grants temporary extra AC, making you harder to hit and harder to damage in melee combat. The amount of protection increases with your character level. This is a useful ability to have if you plan to kill monsters in melee.</indent>
