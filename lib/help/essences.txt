Essences are the tools of the trade for Alchemists, and 
unfortunately are useless for any other class. Alchemists
use essences to create magical items for them to use. 

They can be either found on the floor while exploring the 
dungeon, or extracted from other magical items the alchemist
finds during their adventures.
