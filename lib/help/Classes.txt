<style:title>The Classes</style>

No decision is so important as which class to play. Below, the many available classes are loosely grouped by their principle playstyle: Melee, Archery, Martial Arts, Magic, Devices, etc. The hybrid classes generally combine melee with a bit of magic and are a good option for a balanced playstyle. In this document, the primary spell stat for each class is <color:v>highlighted</color>.

For details on the <color:keyword>Primary Statistics</color>, see <link:birth.txt#PrimaryStats>. For information about the various <color:keyword>Skills</color>, see <link:birth.txt#PrimarySkills>. The skill descriptions in this document are for comparison purposes only. For example, your fledgling berserker will not be born with <color:v>Legendary[32]</color> melee skill. In general, skills are influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. To compare the various classes at a glance, you might want to take a look at <link:Classes.txt#Tables> the class tables below.

  <indent><topic:Berserker><color:o>Berserker</color>
A Berserker is a fearful fighter indeed, immune to fear and paralysis. At high levels, Berserkers can reflect bolt spells with their tough flesh. Furthermore, they can fight without weapons, can remove cursed equipment by force, and can even use their special combat techniques when surrounded by an anti-magic barrier. Berserkers, however, cannot use any magical devices or read any scrolls, and are hopeless at all non-combat skills. Since Berserker Spectres are quite easy to *win* with, their scores are lowered.
 
Berserkers use a unique system of techniques called 'Rage'. They gain more techniques as they gain levels. They use no magic: indeed, they cannot use any magic devices or activate any artifacts, and cannot read scrolls. To offset these great disadvantages, Berserkers are allowed to have an important class power - 'Recall'.

<topic:Blood-Knight><color:o>Blood-Knight</color>
A Blood-Knight is a fighter who has delved into the dark arts and can perform a limited number of offensive effects using his own health. In addition to the HP cost, using an ability also causes bleeding/wounds, with an amount proportional to the cost of the ability. Their primary stat for abilities is Con.
 
Blood-Knights are strong in melee, but are very unusual in the fact that the more wounded they are, the stronger they become. When damaged, they gain additional melee attacks and damage, and moreso the more wounded and cut they become. Indeed, when on the brink of death they are the strongest fighters imaginable, and stories of their legendary feats abound. Of course, with great power comes great risk of death, and you don't recall ever meeting one of these heroes of legend in person!
 
Since the Blood-Knight relies on their own blood for their power, they are restricted to only certain races. No non-living race may walk the red path.

<topic:Duelist><color:o>Duelist</color>
The duelist is the ultimate one-on-one fighter, but finds himself at a severe disadvantage when facing numerous strong foes. When facing an enemy, the duelist first issues a challenge, marking that foe for a one on one duel. Of course, this wakes the monster up (There is no honor in dueling a sleeping enemy). And while the duelist will honor the fight as a one on one affair, many monsters have no such scruples.
 
Against a challenged foe, the duelist is very strong gaining a bonus to saving throws, armor class, damage reduction and combat prowess. On the other hand, due to the single-mindedness of their focus, the duelist is quite vulnerable to unchallenged opponents. Most of the techniques of this class aim at enforcing the sanctity of the duel.
 
The duelist only ever gains a single attack in combat, but they make the most of this blow by gaining enhanced effects as they gain experience. Able to wound, stun, and even hamstring their foes, the prowess of the duelist in a one on one encounter is legendary!
 
Duelists favor light armors and cannot equip a shield. They gain no extra bonus when wielding a weapon with both hands. For their techniques the duelist relies on dexterity.

<topic:Mauler><color:o>Mauler</color>
The Mauler favors extremely heavy weapons, and possesses powerful abilities whose effectiveness depends on the weight of the weapon. While they only gain a limited number of blows which can never be magically increased, they are capable of hitting opponents very hard to make the most of each strike. The Mauler is required to use both hands on a single weapon when wielding if they wish their talents to function properly.

<topic:Rune-Knight><color:o>Rune-Knight</color>
The <color:keyword>Rune Knight</color> is a mythical warrior who is dedicated to the discovery of ancient runes that hold immense power. They may fix mystical runes of various types to their equipment in order to gain permanent bonuses, even on artifacts! Alternatively, they may conjure a temporary rune which, when placed on their weapon, allows them to attack with enhanced effects. They may also place temporary runes directly on their person for one time or temporary bonuses. Finally, they may even alter their surroundings with various runes of change.
 
All runes (except <color:B>{Absorption}</color>) require mana for creation. However, unlike ordinary spell casters, the Rune Knight does not regenerate mana on their own. Rather, they must siphon mana from magical or elemental attacks directed against them, and doing so requires a special rune of <color:B>{Absorption}</color>. This rune should be worn at all times (or at least kept handy).
 
The Rune Knight does not play like an ordinary spell caster. Rather, think of them as a cross between a a warrior and a weaponsmith that can, on occasion, cast a useful spell. If you have mana available, then consider using spells. Otherwise, play as a warrior and wait to absorb mana. This can take time, depending on the foes you face, but the Rune Knight's honor should prevent them from seeking out weak, defensless spell casters.

See <link:Runeknights.txt> for more details on rune knights.

<topic:Samurai><color:o>Samurai</color>
Samurai, masters of the art of the blade, are the next strongest fighters after Warriors, and can use various special combat techniques. Samurai are not good at most other skills, and many magical devices may be too difficult for them to use. Wisdom determines a Samurai's ability to use the special combat techniques available to him.
 
Samurai use the art of the blade called Kendo (or Bugei). Books of Kendo are similar to spellbooks, but Samurai don't need to carry them around; the books are needed only when they study new combat techniques. Samurai need a weapon wielded to use the techniques of Kendo, and most techniques will add powerful special properties to their blows; such as flaming, poisoning, vampiric, etc... Their maximum spellpoints don't depend on their level but solely on wisdom, and they can use the class power 'Concentration' to temporarily increase SP beyond its usual maximum value. They have one more class power - 'Assume a Posture'. They can choose different forms of posture in different situations.

<topic:Warrior><color:o>Warrior</color>
A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of a magical device. Unfortunately, many high-level devices may be forever beyond their use.
 
Warriors cast no spells. They hate magic. In fact, they even gain experience for destroying high level spellbooks. They have a class power - 'Sword Dancing' - which allows them to conduct a melee attack in six random directions.

The weaponmaster is great with a single class of weapons. The character gets combat bonuses and special powers depending on the type of specialization. Alas, the weaponmaster is truly lousy when using any weapon outside their chosen specialty so focus is key.

<topic:Weaponsmith><color:o>Weaponsmith</color>
A Weaponsmith can improve weapons and armors for him or herself. They are good at fighting, and they have potential ability to become even better than Warriors using improved equipment. They cannot cast spells, and are poor at skills such as stealth or magic defense.
 
A Weaponsmith extracts the essences of special effects from weapons or armors which have various special abilities, and can add these essences to another weapon or armor. Normally, each equipment can be improved only once, but they can remove a previously added essence from improved equipment to improve it with another essence. To-hit, to-damage bonus, and AC can be improved freely up to a maximum value depending on level. Weaponsmiths use class powers for Smithing commands.

Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class around with any bow, crossbow, or sling. They need a lot of ammunition, but will learn how to make it from junk found in the dungeon. An archer is better than a warrior at stealth, perception, searching and magical devices.
 
Archers have a class power - 'Create Ammo' - which creates stones or shots from pile of rubble, and arrows and crossbow bolts from bones.

Snipers are specialists in marksmanship, but not like archers who fire off arrow after arrow in swift succession. They don't just increase accuracy and power of shots by concentration, they can use fearsome archery techniques.
 
What they require is powerful bows or crossbows, good quality ammunition and the fortitude to bear up without flinching under any situation.
 
Snipers know their enemies well and can shoot them from the shadows. They have no time for magic.

  <indent><topic:Force-Trainer><color:o>Force-Trainer</color>
A Force-Trainer is a master of the spiritual Force. They prefer fighting with neither weapon nor armor. They are not as good fighters as are Monks, but they can use both magic and the spiritual Force. Wielding weapons or wearing heavy armor disturbs use of the Force. Wisdom is a Force-Trainer's primary stat.
 
Force-Trainers use both spellbook magic and the special spiritual power called the Force. They can select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Death, and Crusade. To use The Force, you select it just as if it were spellbook 'F'; which means you need to press 'm' and then 'F' to select the Force. The most important spell of the Force is 'Improve Force'; each time a Force-Trainer activates it, their Force power becomes more powerful, and their attack power in bare-handed melee fighting is increased temporarily. The strengthened Force can be released at one stroke when a Force-Trainer activates some other Force spell, typically an attack spell. They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.

<topic:Monk><color:o>Monk</color>
The Monk character class is very different from all other classes. Their training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with no armor or weapons. To gain the resistances necessary for survival a monk may need to wear some kind of armor, but if the armor he wears is too heavy, it will severely disturb his martial arts maneuvers. As the monk advances levels, new, powerful forms of attack become available. Their defensive capabilities increase likewise, but if armor is being worn, this effect decreases. Wisdom determines a Monk's spell casting ability.
 
The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas of magic. They select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Trump and Death. They will eventually learn all prayers in the discipline of their choice. They have two class powers - 'Assume a Posture' and 'Double Attack'. They can choose different forms of postures in different situations, and use powerful combinations of attacks for the finishing blow.

Mystics are masters of bare handed fighting, like Monks. However, they do not learn normal spells. Instead, they gain mystical powers with experience, and these powers directly influence their martial arts. In this respect, Mystics are similar to the Samurai. Indeed, they even concentrate to boost their mana like the Samurai. Mystics eschew weapons of any kind and require the lightest of armors in order to practice their martial arts. The number of attacks are influenced by dexterity and experience level while the mystic's mana and fail rates are influenced by charisma. Mystics are in tune with the natural forces around them and may even call on aid when necessary. It has been whispered that mystics have even discovered how to kill an opponent with a single touch, though they do not share this knowledge with novices.

A Blood Mage is similar to a normal mage in his selection and variety of spells, but differs in that he has no separate mana pool. Instead, all his spells are powered by his health. Moreover, due to the Blood Mage's abnormal constitution, all healing is much less effective than normal. In fact, the Blood Mage completely eschews all healing magic as this disrupts the flow of blood that is the essence of their power. They completely shun the realm of Life as anathema to all that is sacred.

<topic:Blue-Mage><color:o>Blue-Mage</color>
A Blue-Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits, as he cannot hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. A major difference between the Mage and the Blue-Mage is the method of learning spells: Blue-Mages may learn spells from monsters. A Blue-Mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
 
A Blue-Mage can learn and cast monster ranged attacks, spells, or summons as their own spells; this technique is called Blue magic. Unlike Imitators, Blue-Mages remember their spells permanently, but they must get hit by a monster's spell while their class power 'Learning' is active to learn spells. Because of this requirement, they do not learn spells, like healing, that affect the monster itself.

<topic:Chaos-Mage><color:o>Chaos-Mage</color>
Chaos Mages are the arcane students of the terrible Demon Lords of Chaos. Every Chaos Mage has a Patron Demon and, when gaining a level, may receive a reward from his Patron. He might be healed or polymorphed, his stats could be increased, or he might be rewarded with an awesome weapon. On the other hand, the Patrons might surround him with monsters, drain his stats or wreck his equipment or they might simply ignore him. The Demon Lords of Chaos are chaotic and unpredictable indeed. The exact type of reward depends on both the Patron Demon (different Demons give different rewards) and chance.
 
Chaos Mages can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon, and one other realm excluding Life and Crusade. A  Chaos Mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
 
Chaos Mages are a little hardier than ordinary mages but less perceptive. They have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods.

<topic:Gray-Mage><color:o>Gray-Mage</color>
The Gray-Mage casts spells from memory, rather than from a book.  Indeed, the spell book is only required for the initial learning process. However, only a small number of spells may be learned at any given time, and while the Gray-Mage may replace old spells with new ones, they can only learn a fixed number of total spells (based upon Intelligence and Experience).
 
The Gray-Mage does not choose spell realms the way an ordinary spell caster would. Instead, they choose a general bias towards one of Good, Neutral or Evil magic. So while all Gray-Mages may learn spells from the Arcane, Armageddon, Chaos, Craft, Sorcery and Trump realms, only a Good Bias allows access to Life and Crusade magic; only a Neutral Bias allows access to Nature magic; and only an Evil Bias allows access to Death and Daemon magic. Still, it is obvious that the Gray Mage will have an extremely large pool of spells from which to choose. Like the Mage, Intelligence is the key stat.

<topic:High-Mage><color:o>High-Mage</color>
High-Mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of magic and learn it very well - much better than the ordinary mage. A High-Mage's prime statistic is intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
 
For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, High-Mages gain substantial benefits in the mana costs, power, minimum levels, and failure rates of the spells in their speciality realm. They are also the only class able to cast Hex spells. High-Mages have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves, or rods; although this power is not available to those who choose the Hex realm.

<topic:Mage><color:o>Mage</color>
A Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits as he cannot hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. In addition to his spellbooks, a Mage should carry a range of magical devices to help him in his endeavors which he can master far more easily than anyone else. A Mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
 
Mages have the least restrictions in choosing and learning spells. They can freely choose any two realms when a character is created. Their natural inclination makes Life magic fairly hard to learn. Otherwise, a mage tends to learn and cast all the spells in his or her realms better than any other character. The ability to choose second realm of magic has a special meaning: Only the second realm can be changed in the middle of the game. You can change second realm with a class power 'Change 2nd Magic Realm' and a spellbook of the new realm. They have another class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods.

<topic:Priest><color:o>Priest</color>
A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They explore the dungeon in the service of their God. They are fairly familiar with magical devices which they believe act as foci for divine intervention in the natural order of things.
 
There are two types of priests: Good and Evil. If the priest chooses Life or Crusade as their first realm, then they will follow the path of good. As such, they may not choose an evil realm for their second realm. Also, good priests abhor bloodshed, and therefore are not comfortable with edged weapons. Wielding one will disrupt their ability to concentrate during prayers. Should a priest choose Death or Daemon as their first realm, however, then they will serve an evil god. As such, they actually enjoy shedding blood, and suffer no such weapon restriction. Of course, evil priests abhor good things, and are unable to choose Life or Crusade for their second realm.
 
Good priests have a strong affinity for Life prayers, and learn them very well, even better than a High Mage. Conversely, evil priests favor prayers of Death, and receive strong bonuses when choosing this foul realm. Otherwise, priests learn spells less efficiently than a Mage would. Also, they may not choose which spell to learn, but are granted new prayers by the whim of their deity, presumably in order to serve some greater divine plan of which the priest is not fully cognizant. The priest's primary prayer stat is Wisdom.

<topic:Necromancer><color:o>Necromancer</color>
A Necromancer attempts to gain both power and knowledge through communion with the dead. They use powerful necromancy magic to summon aid from the dead, whether directly in terms of undead servitude, or indirectly through other-worldly knowledge. Necromancy also offers myriad foul offensive spells, but all of these require the Necromancer to physically touch his foe. To do so, the Necromancer may wield neither weapon, nor gloves. But a powerful necromancer is truly awe inspiring, and may even kill foes with a single deadly touch! In addition, they forever hunt for the legendary Eye and Hand of Vecna in order to complete their power.

<topic:Yellow-Mage><color:o>Yellow-Mage</color>
A Yellow Mage is a type of Mage who focuses on rapid spell casting. Much as the Warrior gets multiple attacks per round, the Yellow Mage may cast multiple spells per round. Their spell speed increases with level. In addition, they may also cast low level spells more quickly as they gain in experience (For example, a CL50 Yellow Mage casting a L35 spell only requires 85% of the normal time, and this bonus applies before their spells per round bonus).
 
In all other respects, the Yellow Mage is similar to the Mage. They may learn spells from two spell realms and use Intelligence as their primary spell statistic. However, due to their focus upon hasty casting, they are unable to learn the mightiest of spells in most realms, especially as regards powerful offensive spells like Mana Storm.

Alchemists are masters of tinctures, concoctions and infusions. They can prepare themselves set infusions from potions that replicate the effect - without consuming inventory space or being in danger of shattering. They are reasonably good at melee, especially with the right potions, though they cannot rival melee specialists. Even bad potions are useful in their hands, as weapons or ingredients. Their other abilities include creating copies of potions and turning items to gold. They require intelligence for some of their abilities.

<topic:Devicemaster><color:o>Devicemaster</color>
Devicemasters are excellent with magical devices, but poor in most other skills. They may shoot or use melee in a pinch, but this will never be their forte. Instead, they must rely on their arsenal of magical devices in order to survive.
 
The Devicemaster chooses to specialize in a particular class of devices and they gain extra bonuses when using devices from their speciality. These bonuses include increased damage, increased speed of activation, extra resistance to charge draining, and even the ability to occasionally power these devices without consuming charges. Each of these abilities becomes greater with experience. In addition, they gain enhanced device skill with speciality devices.
 
Devicemasters have a few magical abilities to enhance their utility with devices. As expected, they gain a powerful talent of Recharging very early on. Also, they may detect magical devices from a distance. At higher levels, they gain the powerful ability to move effects from one device to another (wand/rod/staff) or to move essence from one potion/scroll to a lower level potion/scroll. As a final ability, the Devicemaster may use multiple charges at once from a given device in an act of desperation. This greatly increases the power of the effect, but may destroy the device in the process.

<topic:Magic-Eater><color:o>Magic-Eater</color>
The Magic-Eater can absorb magical devices. Once absorbed, these devices will function like normal objects and can be used whenever charges are available. In effect, it is as if the Magic-Eater had extra inventory slots for devices. However, absorbed magic can not be drained the way normal devices can, nor can these objects be destroyed. There are fixed number of slots for each kind of device, and the Magic-Eater will need to choose which object to replace once the slots are all used. Absorbed magic can not be recharged the way normal devices can. Instead, the Magic-Eater must rest to regain charges the way a normal spellcaster must rest to regain mana. Similarly, the Magic-Eater may quaff a potion to restore mana to speed this process, though this will not necessarily restore all of their absorbed magic.

  <indent><topic:Ninja><color:o>Ninja</color>
A Ninja is a fearful assassin lurking in darkness. He or she can navigate effectively with no light source, catch enemies by surprise, and kill with a single blow. Ninjas can use Ninjutsu, and are good at locating hidden traps and doors, disarming traps and picking locks. Since heavy armors, heavy weapons, or shields will restrict their motion greatly, they prefer light clothes, and become faster and more stealthy as they gain levels. A Ninja knows no fear and, at high level, becomes almost immune to poison and able to see invisible things. Dexterity determines a Ninja's ability to use Ninjutsu.
 
A Ninja can use Ninjutsu for lurking and surprise attacks. They gain more Ninjutsu techniques as they gain levels. They have a class power - 'Quick Walk' - which makes their walking speed extremely fast.

<topic:Rogue><color:o>Rogue</color>
A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot. Rogues are good at locating hidden traps and doors and are masters of disarming traps and picking locks. A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneak around many creatures without having to fight, or to get in a telling first blow. A rogue may also backstab a fleeing monster. Rogues also gain shooting bonuses when using a sling.
 
Rogues can select one realm - Sorcery, Death, Trump, Arcane, Craft, Law,or Burglary. Except for this last realm, rogues have certain limitations on which spells they can learn, and they do not learn new spells very quickly. The Burglary Realm however is unique to the rogue and offers spells for setting traps, picking pockets, negotiating with other thieves, and escaping from a tight spot. Burglary rogues are agents of the Black Market and receive favorable pricing from that shop. A Burglary rogue uses DEX as their spellcasting stat, and may learn spells beginning at level 1. For other realms, however, the rogue uses INT as the spellcasting stat, and won't be able to learn spells until level 5.

<topic:Scout><color:o>Scout</color>
The scout is the vanguard of any attack, and excels at stealth and observation skills. The scout is not the best at one-on-one combat, but is unparalleled at ambush techniques to destroy groups of weak sentries. The scout is lightly armored, and heavy armors disrupt their abilities. Furthermore, the scout can only effectively dodge in open areas, being confined severely hampers the scout's defensive abilities.

  <indent><topic:Chaos-Warrior><color:o>Chaos-Warrior</color>
Chaos Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon Lords of Chaos. Every Chaos Warrior has a Patron Demon and, when gaining a level, may receive a reward from his Patron. He might be healed or polymorphed, his stats could be increased, or he might be rewarded with an awesome weapon. On the other hand, the Patrons might surround him with monsters, drain his stats or wreck his equipment or they might simply ignore him. The Demon Lords of Chaos are chaotic and unpredictable indeed. The exact type of reward depends on both the Patron Demon (different Demons give different rewards) and chance.
 
Chaos Warriors can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon. They are not interested in any other form of magic. They can learn every spell. They have a class power - 'Confusing Light' - which stuns, confuses, and scares all monsters in sight.

<topic:Disciple><color:o>Disciple</color>
Trusted followers of mysterious ancient spirits known as the 'Purples', the Disciples roam the world running errands for their masters, learning mighty spells and receiving rare items as rewards for their work. There are three main flavors of Purple Disciples - disciples of Karrot, disciples of Yeqrezh, and disciples of a group of Purples known as the Troika. Each of the Purples expects different things of their Disciples, and each helps them achieve their ends in very different ways.

See <link:Disciples.txt> for more details on disciples.

The Ninja-Lawyer moves silently in the night, combining the stealth, agility and offensive power of the ninja with the subtle practical tools of the lawyer. Ninja-Lawyers, like specialist ninjas, prefer light armor and stabbing weapons and acquire the powerful 'Quick Walk' class power. A ninja-lawyer relies on both wisdom and dexterity, requiring the former for legal tricks and the latter for ninjutsu.

<topic:Paladin><color:o>Paladin</color>
A Paladin is a combination of a warrior and a priest. Paladins are very good fighters, but not very good at missile weapons. A paladin lacks much in the way of abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and magical devices but has a decent saving throw due to his divine alliance. Wisdom determines a Paladin's success at praying to his deity.
 
Paladins can select a realm from Life, Crusade, Daemon and Death. Like priests, they cannot select which prayers to learn, but are rewarded with new prayers by their deities. They can learn all spells, but not as fast as priests. They detest paganism so strongly that they will even gain experience for destroying high-level pagan spellbooks: 'pagan' means Life or Crusade spellbooks for a Death/Daemon Paladin and all spellbooks other than Life or Crusade for a Life/Crusade Paladin. Depending on their realm, they have a class power - 'Holy Lance' or 'Hell Lance'.

A Ranger is a combination of a warrior and a mage who has developed a special affinity for the natural world around him. He is a good fighter and also excellent with a bow. A ranger has good stealth, perception, searching and magical resistance. Also, rangers are familiar with magical devices and use them well. Wisdom determines a Ranger's spell casting ability.
 
All rangers are trained in Nature magic, and all of these spells are available to them. They even learn these spells almost as fast as mages. They can also select a secondary realm (from Sorcery, Chaos, Death, Trump, Arcane, and Daemon), but they are slow learners here, and may find themselves unable to learn some of the highest level spells. They have a class power - 'Probe Monster' - which allows them to know a monster's HP, speed, and experience required to evolve.

<topic:Red-Mage><color:o>Red-Mage</color>
Red Mages are similar to Warrior-Mage; they are decent fighters and spellcasters. Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower rank spellbooks of all realms, but they cannot cast spells from higher rank spellbooks, and they are extremely slow learners in them. They are not bad at using magical devices and magic resistance, but are bad at other skills. A red-mage's prime statistic is intelligence.
 
Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower rank spellbooks of all realms: first and second spellbooks of all realms and third and fourth Arcane spellbooks, without having to learn it, but they cannot cast spells from higher rank spellbooks; third and fourth spellbooks for all realms other than Arcane. Since they use all realms at once, they have large penalties in the mana costs, minimum levels, and failure rates of spells. They have a class power - 'Double Magic' - which allows them to cast two spells at once.

<topic:Warrior-Mage><color:o>Warrior-Mage</color>
A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross between the warrior and mage classes. While their brothers, the rangers, specialize in Nature magic and survival skills, true Warrior-Mages attempt to reach the best of both worlds. As warriors they are much superior to the usual Mage class. Intelligence determines a Warrior-Mage's spell casting ability.
 
Warrior-mages begin the game with Arcane magic, and they can freely select another realm of magic. Although they do not gain new spells as fast as regular mages, they will eventually learn every spell in both realms, thus making them a very competitive choice for players who appreciate Arcane magic. They have two class powers - 'Convert HP to SP' and 'Convert SP to HP' - which allow them to heal HP using mana or gain mana using HP.

Beastmasters can cast trump magic, and are very good at summoning spells, but they can not summon non-living creatures. Charisma determines a Beastmaster's spell casting ability.
 
Beastmasters use Trump magic to make good use of their monster domination and riding abilities. They are very good at summoning living creatures, and they learn summoning spells quicker than Mages. However, they cannot summon non-living creatures. They have two class powers - 'Dominate a Living Thing' and 'Dominate Living Things'.

The Mindcrafter is a unique class that uses the powers of the mind instead of magic. These powers are unique to Mindcrafters, and vary from simple extrasensory powers to mental domination of others. Since these powers are developed by the practice of certain disciplines, a Mindcrafter requires no spellbooks to use them. The available powers are simply determined by the character's level. Wisdom determines a Mindcrafter's ability to use mind powers.
 
Mindcrafters gain new mindcrafting powers and their existing ones become stronger as they gain levels. They can use their power even when blinded. They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.

<topic:Mirror-Master><color:o>Mirror-Master</color>
Mirror-Masters are spell casters; like other mages, they must live by their wits. They can create magical mirrors, and employ them in the casting of Mirror-Magic spells. Intelligence determines a Mirror-Master's spell casting ability.
 
Mirror-Masters gain more spells and each spell becomes more powerful as they gain levels. They can use their spells even when blinded. For Mirror-Masters, the arrangement of mirrors is very important: Some attack spells reflect from mirrors, and some other spells are effective only against monsters standing on a mirror. A Mirror-Master standing on a mirror has greater ability and, for example, can perform quick teleports. The maximum number of magical Mirrors which can be controlled simultaneously depends on the level, and breaking unnecessary mirrors is important work for them. They have two class powers - 'Break Mirrors', which breaks all mirrors in current dungeon level and 'Mirror Concentration', which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana on a mirror.

<topic:Psion><color:o>Psion</color>
The Psion is like a Mindcrafter, and uses innate mental powers. Unlike the Mindcrafter, however, Psions have the freedom to learn powers that enforce their own styles. They learn very few powers, but they can scale their powers to determine the SP cost and the powers' potency. Psionic powers require great concentration, however, and psions do not have the mind to spare to care for others. The Psion gains powers at the following levels: 1, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 40 and 50. The Psion uses Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma as their primary spell stat, which ever is currently highest. In this respect, Psions are truly unique!

<topic:Time-Lord><color:o>Time-Lord</color>
Time-Lords are masters of temporal magic, altering the flow of time to their advantage. They don't learn spells from books, but rather gain new powers as they grow more experienced. They are the only class that can affect monsters with time based attacks. Not only do these damage their foes, but they also inflict a wide variety of possible effects, from slowing to amnesia, from evolution to devolution, from weakening to stasis. In addition to temporal attacks, the Time-Lord gains great powers of speed, and they grow faster with experience. It is said that masters of time can even see the future, avoiding attacks that would otherwise prove fatal! Also, legend has it that the greatest Time-Lords are able to take multiple actions in a single turn.
 
Time-Lords are mediocre fighters and not good at archery at all. They are OK with magical devices, but nowhere near as proficient as are mages. They have midling stealth. At high levels, they become resistant to time. The Time-Lord's primary magic stat is Wisdom.

<topic:Warlock><color:o>Warlock</color>
A Warlock is a magical class but, unlike normal spellcasters, they derive their powers, stats, skills and bonuses by making a pact with a given class of monsters. This pact is irrevocable and is made at the outset of the Warlock's career. Depending on the class of monsters with whom they ally, the warlock will gain unique bonuses, abilities and magical powers. For example, alliance with the forces of the netherworld grants resistances to poison and nether, enhanced constitution and spells to control and conjure the unliving as well as spells to access the damaging forces of the netherworld directly. Each such alliance has thematic bonuses and powers, and you can read the details in the respective help sections. On final comment: allying with a given class of monsters dramatically reduces the warlock's ability to fight these foes. Instead, the warlock seeks cooperation with their brethren, or, perhaps, domination over them. But direct assaults are rarely successful.
 
In addition to pact related spells, all warlocks gain access to the unique power of the Eldritch Blast. Their primary spell stat is Charisma since they seek dominion and alliance with their chosen kin, and these monsters tend to have a strong will of their own, resisting the binding forces which the warlock imposes to gain both mastery and power.

See <link:Warlocks.txt> for more details on warlock pacts.

His powers of perception and detection are very great, as is his skill with arcane devices. At high levels he can use the dark magic of the entombed Pharaohs.

<topic:Bard><color:o>Bard</color>
Bards are something like traditional musicians. Their magical attacks are sound-based, and last as long as the Bard has mana. Although a bard cannot sing two or more songs at the same time, he or she does have the advantage that many songs affect all areas in sight. A bard's prime statistic is charisma.
 
The songs are found in four songbooks, of which two are sold in town. There is a special feature of music; many songs continue to be sung until either the Bard chooses to stop, or he runs out of the energy required to sing that type of song. Bards have a class power - 'Stop Singing'.

<topic:Imitator><color:o>Imitator</color>
Imitators have enough fighting skills to survive, but rely on their unique technique - 'Imitation' - which imitates monster spells/techniques including their damage and duration. Dexterity determines general imitation ability, but a stat related to the specific action is often also taken into account.
 
To use imitation, Imitators must see monster's spell at first. When a viewable monsters uses a spell, it is added to a temporary spell list which the imitator can choose from. Spells should be imitated quickly, because timing and situation are everything. An imitator can only repeat a spell once each time he observes it. They only have a small long-term memory for spells, which ranges from one to three, depending on their level. When they memorize more spells than this, they will forget the oldest spell in the list. They have a class power - 'Double Revenge' - which allows them to imitate spells at double damage or duration.

<topic:Rage-Mage><color:o>Rage-Mage</color>
The Rage Mage is part of a secret sect descending from the Barbarians in response to their natural foes, the mages. As time passed, other races have also begun to learn their arts. The powers of the Rage Mage are spells learned from books, but they don't work the way normal spells do. First of all, the Rage Mage must perform a special Ritual of Anger to learn a spell, and this ritual destroys the spell book in the process. As a result, it may take a long time for the Rage Mage to learn all of their high level powers. Once learned, the Rage Mage no longers requires the spell book in order to perform the power.
 
Another unique aspect of the Rage Mage concerns their Mana pool. Unlike normal spellcasters, the Rage Mage's mana does not regenerate on its own. In fact, their mana actually decreases rapidly each turn, meaning that they had better use their powers quickly while they still can. The Rage Mage gains mana whenever he is the target of a magical spell. Indeed, magic makes the Rage Mage very angry! The Rage Mage can also fuel their mana by hurting those around them. This can be quite effective in crowded situations.

<topic:Skillmaster><color:o>Skillmaster</color>
The Skillmaster is not your ordinary class. Instead, you may design your own class, on the fly, using a point based skill system. Upon birth, you will get 5 points to spend and you should use these wisely to set the basic direction of your class. Upon gaining every fifth level, you will receive an additional point to spend, for fifteen points overall. You may use these points to learn melee or to gain access to spell realms. You can improve your speed or your stealth. Or you may gain increased magic device skills. In addition, you may learn riding skills, dual wielding or even martial arts. You will have a lot of flexibility in how you choose to play this class.
 
Most skills allow the investment of multiple points for increased proficiency, but some are abilities that you may buy with a single point (e.g. Luck). This class is not recommended for beginning or immediate players. You only have a limited amount of points to spend, and your choices are irreversible.

See <link:Skillmasters.txt> for more details on skillmasters.

The Wild-Talent gains random talents and abilities as they level up. They are good fighters, and decent with magical devices, but their true forte is their vast array of potential random powers. Except you never know what those might be!
 
Wild-Talents do not have a spell stat. Instead, each ability that they gain requires its own individual stat for purposes of fail rate calculation. For example, Tossing a Boulder requires Strength while Magic Missile requires Intelligence. Each spell requires mana to cast, but the amount of mana available is not influenced by any particular stat and is simply determined by experience.
