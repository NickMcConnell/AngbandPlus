<style:title>The Classes</style>

No decision is so important as which class to play. Below, the many available classes are loosely grouped by their principal strength or playstyle: Melee, Archery, Martial Arts, Magic, Devices, Hybrid, etc. The primary spell stat for each class is <color:v>highlighted</color>.

For details on the <color:keyword>Stats</color>, see <link:birth.txt#PrimaryStats>. For information about the <color:keyword>Skills</color>, see <link:birth.txt#PrimarySkills>. The skill descriptions in this document are <color:v>for comparison purposes only</color>; for example, your fledgling berserker will not really be born with <color:v>Amber[25]</color> melee skill. In general, skills are influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. See the tables at the bottom of this file (<link:Classes.txt#Tables>) to compare the various classes' stat and skill boosts at a glance.

  <indent><topic:Berserker><color:o>Berserker</color>
A Berserker is a fearful fighter indeed, immune to fear and paralysis. At high levels, Berserkers can reflect bolt spells with their tough flesh. Furthermore, they can remove cursed equipment by force, and their special combat techniques are not affected by anti-magic barriers. Berserkers cannot, however, use any magical devices or read any scrolls, and are hopeless at all non-combat skills. To offset these great disadvantages, they gain an important class power - 'Recall' - very early.

<topic:Blood-Knight><color:o>Blood-Knight</color>
Blood-Knights are fighters who have delved into the dark arts and can perform some special offensive effects using their own health. In addition to the HP cost, using such an ability causes bleeding, with an amount proportional to the cost of the ability. These special abilities rely on Constitution.
 
Blood-Knights are very unusual in that cuts and low health make them more powerful; at full health their melee is nothing special, but the more damaged and wounded they are, the faster and deadlier their attacks become. On the brink of death they are the strongest fighters imaginable, and stories of their legendary feats abound; but with great power comes great risk of death, and you don't recall ever meeting one of these heroes of legend in person!
 
Blood-Knights, like Blood-Mages, receive reduced benefits from healing magic. Since a Blood-Knight relies on their own blood for their power, this class is restricted to certain races; no non-living race may walk the red path.

<topic:Duelist><color:o>Duelist</color>
The duelist is the ultimate one-on-one fighter, but finds himself at a severe disadvantage when facing numerous strong foes at once. To start a duel, the duelist first issues a challenge to his intended foe; of course, this will wake the monster up, as there is no honor in dueling a sleeping enemy! And while the duelist will honor the fight as a one-on-one affair, many monsters have no such scruples.
 
Against a challenged foe the duelist is extremely strong, gaining bonuses to saving throws, armor class, damage reduction and combat prowess. On the other hand, due to the single-mindedness of their focus, the duelist is quite vulnerable to unchallenged opponents. Most of the special techniques of this class aim at enforcing the sanctity of the duel.
 
The duelist only ever gains a single attack in combat, but they make the most of this blow by gaining enhanced effects as they gain experience. Able to wound, stun, and even hamstring their foes, the prowess of the duelist in a one-on-one encounter is legendary!
 
Duelists favor light armors and weapons, and cannot equip a shield. They gain no extra bonus for wielding a weapon with both hands. For their techniques, the duelist relies on Dexterity.

<topic:Mauler><color:o>Mauler</color>
The Mauler favors extremely heavy weapons, and possesses powerful abilities whose effectiveness depends on the weight of the weapon. While they only gain a limited number of blows which can never be magically increased, they are capable of hitting opponents exceptionally hard to make the most of each strike. Maulers must wield a single weapon with two hands for their talents to function properly.

<topic:Rune-Knight><color:o>Rune-Knight</color>
The Rune-Knight is a mythical warrior, dedicated to the discovery of ancient runes that hold immense power. They may fix mystical runes of various types to their equipment in order to gain permanent bonuses; even artifacts can be improved this way! Alternatively, they may conjure a temporary rune which allows them to attack with enhanced effects, or place one directly on their person for a one-time or temporary bonus. Finally, they may alter their surroundings with various runes of change.
 
All runes (except <color:B>{Absorption}</color>) require mana for creation; however, unlike ordinary spellcasters, Rune-Knights do not regenerate mana on their own. Rather, they must siphon mana from magical or elemental attacks directed against them, and doing so requires the special rune of <color:B>{Absorption}</color>. This rune should be worn at all times, or at least kept handy.
 
Despite having mana, the Rune-Knight does not play like an ordinary spellcaster; they are more like a weaponsmith but can, on occasion, cast useful spells. If you have mana available, consider using these spells; otherwise, play as a warrior and wait to absorb mana. This can take time, depending on the foes you face, but the Rune-Knight's honor should prevent them from seeking out weak, defenseless spellcasters; being one of the strongest classes, Rune-Knights have no need to resort to exploits...

See <link:Runeknights.txt> for more details on rune knights.

<topic:Samurai><color:o>Samurai</color>
Samurai, masters of the art of the blade, are among the strongest fighters and can use various special combat techniques. Samurai are not good at most non-combat skills, and many magical devices in particular may be too difficult for them to use. Wisdom determines a Samurai's ability to use the special combat techniques available.
 
Samurai use the art of the blade called Kendo (or Bugei). Books of Kendo are similar to spellbooks, but do not need to be carried around; they are only required for studying new combat techniques. Samurai need to wield a weapon to use Kendo, and many of their techniques will add special properties to their blows; these are often slays or brands such as flaming or poisoning, but can be much more powerful than a normal brand. The mana pool of a Samurai does not depend on their level but solely on wisdom; and they can use the class power 'Concentration' to temporarily increase their mana beyond its usual maximum value. The other Samurai class power, 'Assume a Posture', allows them to choose different postures depending on the needs of a situation.

<topic:Warrior><color:o>Warrior</color>
A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of a magical device. Unfortunately, many high-level devices may be forever beyond their use.
 
Warriors cast no spells. They hate magic. In fact, they even gain experience for destroying high level spellbooks. They have a class power - 'Sword Dancing' - which allows them to conduct a melee attack in six random directions.

<topic:Weaponmaster><color:o>Weaponmaster</color>
A Weaponmaster is exceptionally good with a single class of weapons, obtaining special combat bonuses and powers which depend on their chosen speciality. Focus is the key to success; weaponmasters are truly lousy with off-speciality weapons, but few can match the prowess they gain with something more suitable in their hands.

See <link:Weaponmasters.txt> for more details on weaponmasters.

<topic:Weaponsmith><color:o>Weaponsmith</color>
A Weaponsmith can improve weapons and armors for him or herself. They are good at fighting, and they have potential ability to become even better than Warriors using improved equipment. They cannot cast spells, and are poor at skills such as stealth or magic defense.
 
A Weaponsmith extracts the essences of special effects from weapons or armors which have various special abilities, and can add these essences to another weapon or armor. Normally, each equipment can be improved only once, but they can remove a previously added essence from improved equipment to improve it with another essence. To-hit, to-damage bonus, and AC can be improved freely up to a maximum value depending on level. Weaponsmiths use class powers for Smithing commands.

Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class around with any bow, crossbow, or sling. They need a lot of ammunition, but will learn how to make it from junk found in the dungeon. An archer is better than a warrior at stealth, perception, searching and magical devices.
 
Archers have a class power - 'Create Ammo' - which creates pebbles or shots from rubble, and arrows and crossbow bolts from bones.

Snipers are specialists in marksmanship, but not like archers who fire off arrow after arrow in swift succession. They don't just increase accuracy and power of shots by concentration, they can use fearsome archery techniques.
 
What they require is powerful bows or crossbows, good quality ammunition and the fortitude to bear up without flinching under any situation.
 
Snipers know their enemies well and can shoot them from the shadows. They have no time for magic.

  <indent><topic:Force-Trainer><color:o>Force-Trainer</color>
A Force-Trainer is a master of the spiritual Force. They prefer fighting with neither weapon nor armor. They are not as good fighters as are Monks, but they can use both magic and the spiritual Force. Wielding weapons or wearing heavy armor disturbs use of the Force. Wisdom is a Force-Trainer's primary stat.
 
Force-Trainers use both spellbook magic and the special spiritual power called the Force. They can select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Death, and Crusade. To use The Force, you select it just as if it were spellbook 'F'; which means you need to press 'm' and then 'F' to select the Force. The most important spell of the Force is 'Improve Force'; each time a Force-Trainer activates it, their Force power becomes more powerful, and their attack power in bare-handed melee fighting is increased temporarily. The strengthened Force can be released at one stroke when a Force-Trainer activates some other Force spell, typically an attack spell. They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.

<topic:Monk><color:o>Monk</color>
Monks are very different from most other classes in that they prefer to fight unarmed; while they can use a few select weapons reasonably well, their training in martial arts makes them more powerful with no weapons. Monks also gain bonuses from empty armor slots; to gain the resistances necessary for survival, some kind of armor will still be eventually needed, but if the armor is too heavy it will severely disturb the Monk's martial arts maneuvers. As the Monk gains levels, more powerful forms of unarmed attack will become available, and the defensive bonuses for having empty armor slots likewise increase.

The various sects of monks are devoted to different areas of magic; they select one realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Trump and Death. Monks will eventually learn all prayers in the discipline of their choice. Wisdom determines their spellcasting ability.

Monks have two class powers, 'Assume a Posture' and 'Double Attack'; they can choose different postures for different situations, and use powerful combinations of attacks for the finishing blow.

<topic:Mystic><color:o>Mystic</color>
Mystics are masters of bare-handed fighting, like Monks. Unlike Monks, though, they do not learn normal spells; instead, they gain mystical powers with experience, and these powers directly influence their martial arts. In this respect, Mystics are somewhat similar to Samurai; indeed, they even concentrate to boost their mana like the Samurai. Mystics eschew weapons of any kind, and require the lightest of armors in order to practice their martial arts. As with other martial artists, their attack speed depends on their level and Dexterity; their mana and fail rates, though, are influenced by Charisma. Mystics are in tune with the natural forces around them, and may even summon animals to their aid when necessary. It is whispered that mystics have discovered a way to kill an opponent with a single touch; but they do not share this knowledge with novices.

A Blood-Mage is similar to a normal mage in his selection and variety of spells, but differs in that he has no separate mana pool; instead, spells are powered by hit points. Moreover, due to the Blood-Mage's abnormal constitution, all healing is much less effective than normal; indeed, Blood-Mages completely eschew healing spells to not disrupt the flow of blood that is the essence of their power. They shun the realm of Life as anathema to all they hold sacred.

<topic:Blue-Mage><color:o>Blue-Mage</color>
Blue-Mages, like all mages, rely on magic rather than muscle; but they are unique in the way they gain new spells, as they learn from monsters rather than books. Blue-Mages' primary spellcasting stat is Intelligence.
 
A Blue-Mage can learn and cast monster spells, summons, and even ranged attacks as their own spells; this technique is called Blue magic. Blue-Mages remember their spells permanently, but to learn a spell they must be directly hit by it while their 'Learning' class power is active. Because of this requirement, Blue-Mages never learn spells like Haste or Healing that affect the monster itself.

<topic:Chaos-Mage><color:o>Chaos-Mage</color>
Chaos Mages are the arcane students of the terrible Demon Lords of Chaos. Every Chaos Mage has a Patron Demon and, when gaining a level, may receive a reward from his Patron. He might be healed or polymorphed, his stats could be increased, or he might be rewarded with an awesome weapon. On the other hand, the Patrons might surround him with monsters, drain his stats or wreck his equipment or they might simply ignore him. The Demon Lords of Chaos are chaotic and unpredictable indeed. The exact type of reward depends on both the Patron Demon (different Demons give different rewards) and chance.
 
Chaos Mages can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon, and one other realm excluding Life and Crusade. A  Chaos Mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
 
Chaos Mages are a little hardier than ordinary mages but less perceptive. They have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods.

<topic:Gray-Mage><color:o>Gray-Mage</color>
The Gray-Mage casts spells from memory rather than books; a spellbook is only required for the initial learning process. However, only ten spells may be memorized at any given time; and while a Gray-Mage may replace old spells with new ones, the total number of spells they can study is limited.

Gray-Mages do not choose specific realms like book spellcasters; instead, they choose a general bias towards either Good, Neutral or Evil magic. So while all Gray-Mages may learn spells from the Arcane, Armageddon, Chaos, Craft, Sorcery and Trump realms, only a Good Bias allows access to Life and Crusade magic; only a Neutral Bias allows access to Nature magic; and only an Evil Bias allows access to Death and Daemon magic. At any one time, a Gray-Mage has relatively few spells directly at their disposal; but their ability to pick the best spells from an extremely large pool more than compensates for this. As with most mages, the key stat is Intelligence.

<topic:High-Mage><color:o>High-Mage</color>
High-Mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of magic and learn it very well - much better than an ordinary mage.

For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, High-Mages gain substantial benefits in the mana costs, power, minimum levels, and failure rates of the spells in their speciality realm. They are also the only class able to cast Hex spells. High-Mages have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves, or rods; although this power is not available to those who choose the Hex realm. Their primary spellcasting stat is Intelligence.

<topic:Mage><color:o>Mage</color>
A Mage is a spellcaster who must live by his wits, as he cannot hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. A Mage always carries his spellbooks with him, but also relies on magical devices, which he can master easily. The primary spellcasting statistic of a Mage is Intelligence.

Mages have few restrictions in choosing and learning spells; they can freely choose any two realms when a character is created, although their natural inclinations make Life magic fairly hard to learn. See <link:magic.txt> for more information on magic, realms and book spellcasting.

<topic:Priest><color:o>Priest</color>
A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They explore the dungeon in the service of their God. They are fairly familiar with magical devices, which they believe act as foci for divine intervention in the natural order of things.
 
There are two types of priests: Good and Evil. If the priest chooses Life or Crusade as their first realm, they will follow the path of good; as such, they may not choose an evil realm for their second realm. Good priests abhor bloodshed, and therefore are not comfortable with edged weapons, although they eventually learn to bless such weapons and then use them without disrupting their prayers. Should a priest choose Death or Daemon as their first realm, however, they will serve an evil god; evil priests actually enjoy shedding blood, and suffer no such weapon restrictions. Of course, evil priests abhor good things, and are unable to choose Life or Crusade for their second realm.
 
Good priests have a strong affinity for Life prayers, and learn them very well, even better than a High-Mage. Conversely, evil priests favor prayers of Death, and receive strong bonuses when choosing this foul realm. Otherwise, priests learn magic less efficiently than a Mage would; but their greater stamina and combat skills compensate for this. Priests, unlike Mages, cannot choose to study specific spells; rather, they are granted new prayers by the whim of their deity, presumably in accordance with some greater divine plan. The primary stat for a priest is Wisdom.

<topic:Necromancer><color:o>Necromancer</color>
A Necromancer attempts to gain both power and knowledge through communion with the dead. They rely on the special realm of Necromancy to summon aid from the dead, whether directly in terms of undead servitude, or indirectly through otherworldly knowledge. Necromancy also offers many foul offensive spells; but all of these require direct physical contact, and so need an empty, gloveless hand to work. Yet this handicap is a cheap price to pay for the ability to kill a foe with one deadly touch!

Necromancers forever hunt for the legendary Eye and Hand of Vecna to complete their power.

Sorcerers are the all-around best magicians, being able to master all spells from almost any magic realm without needing to study them or gain proficiency with them. On the downside, they have by far the fewest hit points of any class; they are also the worst fighters in the dungeon, being unable to use any weapon but a Wizardstaff.
 
Sorcerers have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods. Unlike other mages, they rely on Charisma as their spell stat.

<topic:Yellow-Mage><color:o>Yellow-Mage</color>
A Yellow-Mage is a type of Mage who focuses on rapid spell casting. The casting speed of Yellow-Mages improves with experience; low-level spells are particularly quick to use, and can eventually be cast as many as five times in one round! But even a level 50 spell requires less than half a turn for an accomplished Yellow-Mage.

In most other respects, a Yellow-Mage is similar to a Mage; they use Intelligence as their primary spell stat, and may learn spells from two spell realms of their choice. However, due to their focus on hasty casting, some of the deepest and most powerful magic will remain forever beyond their grasp.

Alchemists are masters of tinctures, concoctions and infusions. They can prepare themselves set infusions from potions that replicate the effect - without consuming inventory space or being in danger of shattering. They are reasonably good at melee, especially with the right potions, though they cannot rival melee specialists. Even bad potions are useful in their hands, as weapons or ingredients. Their other abilities include creating copies of potions and turning items to gold. They require intelligence for some of their abilities.

<topic:Devicemaster><color:o>Devicemaster</color>
Devicemasters are excellent with magical devices, but poor in most other skills. They may shoot or use melee in a pinch, but this will never be their forte; instead, they conquer through their arsenal of magical devices.
 
Each Devicemaster chooses to specialize in a particular class of devices, and will gain extra bonuses for speciality items. These bonuses include increased damage, increased speed of activation, extra resistance to charge draining, and even the ability to occasionally power these devices without consuming charges; each of these abilities becomes stronger with experience. In addition, speciality devices are easier to use, although all Devicemasters are also good with devices of other types.
 
Devicemasters have several useful device-related powers; they may detect magical devices from a distance, and gain the powerful talent of Recharging very early on. At higher levels, they gain the ability to move effects from one device to another, or to move magical essences from one item to another if they specialize in Potions or Scrolls. In times of desperate need, the Devicemaster may drain a speciality item of multiple charges at once; this greatly increases the power of the effect, but may destroy the device in the process.

<topic:Magic-Eater><color:o>Magic-Eater</color>
The Magic-Eater can absorb magical devices. Once absorbed, these devices will function like normal objects and can be used whenever charges are available. In effect, it is as if the Magic-Eater had extra inventory slots for devices. However, absorbed magic can not be drained the way normal devices can, nor can these objects be destroyed. The number of slots for each kind of device is limited, and the Magic-Eater will need to choose which object to replace once the slots are all used. Absorbed magic cannot be recharged through scrolls, spells, potions or activations; the Magic-Eater must rest to regain charges. The rate at which absorbed devices recharge is affected by Regeneration.

Since heavy armors, heavy weapons, or shields will restrict their motion greatly, they prefer light clothes, and become faster and more stealthy as they gain levels. A Ninja knows no fear and, at high level, becomes almost immune to poison and able to see invisible things. Dexterity determines a Ninja's ability to use Ninjutsu.
 
A Ninja can use Ninjutsu for lurking and surprise attacks. They gain more Ninjutsu techniques as they gain levels. They have a class power - 'Quick Walk' - which makes their walking speed extremely fast.

<topic:Rogue><color:o>Rogue</color>
A Rogue is a character who prefers to live by their cunning, yet is capable of fighting their way out of a tight spot when necessary. Rogues are good at locating secret doors and hidden traps, and are masters of trap-disarming and lockpicking. Their exceptional stealth allows rogues to sneak around sleeping creatures without having to fight; they can also backstab a fleeing monster or surprise an enemy with a telling first blow. Rogues are fairly good at ranged combat, and receive special bonuses when shooting with a sling.
 
Rogues can select one realm - Sorcery, Death, Trump, Arcane, Craft, Law, or Burglary. Except for this last realm, rogues have certain limitations on which spells they can learn, and they do not learn new spells very quickly. The Burglary realm is unique to the rogue, and the speciality of the class; it offers spells for setting traps, picking pockets, negotiating with other thieves, and escaping from a tight spot. Burglary rogues are agents of the Black Market and receive favorable pricing from that shop. Burglary rogues use Dexterity as their spellcasting stat, and can use this special art from the beginning of their adventures; rogues of other realms, however, rely on Intelligence and cannot learn magic spells before they reach level 5.

<topic:Scout><color:o>Scout</color>
The scout is the vanguard of any attack, and excels at stealth and observation skills. Scouts are not the best at one-on-one combat, but are unparalleled at ambush techniques for destroying groups of weak sentries. Scouts are lightly armored, and heavy armor disrupts their abilities. Unlike most characters, scouts are not at home in cramped corridors; in open areas they can dodge attacks effectively, but being confined severely hampers their defensive abilities.

  <indent><topic:Chaos-Warrior><color:o>Chaos-Warrior</color>
Chaos-Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon Lords of Chaos. Every Chaos-Warrior has a patron demon, who may give him a reward on level-up; the Chaos-Warrior may be healed or polymorphed, have his stats increased, or be rewarded with an awesome weapon. On the other hand, though, he might be severely punished or simply ignored by the patron; the Demon Lords of Chaos are unpredictable indeed, although rewards are thankfully more common than punishments. The exact reward will not depend on anything the player does, and is up entirely to random chance and the patron; each patron gives out different rewards and punishments.
 
Chaos-Warriors select one spell realm, either Chaos or Daemon; they have no interest in other forms of magic. They can learn every spell in their chosen realm. At level 40 they gain the powerful ability to emit confusing lights, with the potential to stun, scare and confuse every creature in sight.

<topic:Disciple><color:o>Disciple</color>
Trusted followers of mysterious ancient spirits known as the 'Purples', the Disciples roam the world running errands for their masters, learning mighty spells and receiving rare items as rewards for their work. There are three main flavors of Purple Disciples - disciples of Karrot, disciples of Yeqrezh, and disciples of a group of Purples known as the Troika. Each of the Purples expects different things of their Disciples, and each helps them achieve their ends in very different ways.

See <link:Disciples.txt> for more details on disciples.

The Ninja-Lawyer moves silently in the night, combining the stealth, agility and offensive power of the ninja with the subtle practical tools of the lawyer. Ninja-Lawyers, like specialist ninjas, prefer light armor and stabbing weapons and acquire the powerful 'Quick Walk' class power. A ninja-lawyer relies on both wisdom and dexterity, requiring the former for legal tricks and the latter for ninjutsu.

<topic:Paladin><color:o>Paladin</color>
A Paladin is a combination of a warrior and a priest. Paladins excel as melee fighters, but are only middling in ranged combat; their stealth, perception, and device skill are likewise mediocre, though their divine alliance gives them a decent saving throw. Wisdom determines a Paladin's success at praying to his deity.
 
Paladins can select a realm from Life, Crusade, Daemon and Death. Like priests, they cannot select which prayers to learn, but are rewarded with new prayers by their deities. They can learn all spells, but not as fast as priests. They detest paganism so strongly that they even gain experience for destroying high-level pagan spellbooks: 'pagan' means Life or Crusade spellbooks for a Death/Daemon Paladin, and all spellbooks other than Life or Crusade for a Life/Crusade Paladin. Paladins receive one class power, 'Holy Lance' or 'Hell Lance', depending on the alignment of their realm.

<topic:Ranger><color:o>Ranger</color>
A Ranger is a seasoned wanderer from the plains or woods, attuned to the natural world. Rangers have few weak points; like mages they are excellent with magic devices, yet they are also fairly good at using bows and melee weapons. Their stealth, searching and perception have been sharpened by their time in the wilderness, and their alliance with the spirits of nature even gives them a good saving throw.
 
All rangers are trained in Nature magic, and all Nature spells are available to them; they even learn these spells almost as fast as mages. They can also select a secondary realm (Sorcery, Chaos, Death, Trump, Arcane, and Daemon); but they are slow learners here, and may find themselves unable to learn some of the highest level spells. Another downside is that rangers, like the priestly classes, lack the ability to choose their own spells; they will learn whatever the capricious nature gods choose to teach them.

Rangers have a class power, 'Animal Companion', which allows them to summon an animal to assist them.The magical powers of a ranger depend on Wisdom.

<topic:Red-Mage><color:o>Red-Mage</color>
Red-Mages make better fighters than most mages, and are also versatile spellcasters who can use many realms without needing to specialize in only one or two. The downside of this wide scope is that Red-Mages' magic is fairly shallow; they have high fail rates, minimum levels and mana costs, and are limited to the first two spellbooks in each realm except for Arcane.

Red-Mages have a class power, 'Double Magic', which allows them to cast two spells at once. As with regular mages, their spellcasting stat is Intelligence.

<topic:Warrior-Mage><color:o>Warrior-Mage</color>
A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross between a warrior and a mage. To support their good-for-mages combat abilities, Warrior-Mages begin the game with Arcane magic and can freely select another spell realm. Although they do not gain new spells as fast as regular mages, they will eventually learn every spell in both realms, thus making them a very competitive choice for those who appreciate Arcane spells. Their class powers allow them to convert either HP to mana, or mana to HP, as needed.

Beastmasters see the fierce creatures of the world as opportunities rather than threats, and their riding skills are almost unparalleled. Between their class powers and access to Trump magic, they have many ways to summon or charm living creatures to serve as their hands and feet. Beastmasters are some of the best shooters outside archery specialists, and their melee skills are good enough to get by on. Charisma determines the spellcasting prowess of a Beastmaster.

Cavalry are masters of horsemanship and enjoy riding to battle.

Mindcrafters rely not on book magic, but on the powers of the mind. These mind powers are specific to this class, and range from extrasensory perception to psychic attacks and the mental domination of others. Most mind powers become accessible fairly early, but gain in strength with more experience. Wisdom determines a Mindcrafter's ability to use mind powers.
 
Mindcrafters' combat skills are reasonably good but far from outstanding; a combination of physical and mental attacks often works better for them than either one alone. A seasoned mindcrafter is very hard to confuse, and can effortlessly detect the minds of others. Mindcrafters have a class power, 'Clear Mind', which allows them to rapidly regenerate mana.

<topic:Mirror-Master><color:o>Mirror-Master</color>
Mirror-Masters are spellcasters; like mages, they must live by their wits. They can create magical mirrors, which they use to support their special Mirror-Magic spells. Intelligence determines a Mirror-Master's spellcasting ability.
 
Mirror-Masters gain more spells with experience, and their spells also become more powerful over time. Much of their magic relies on the careful placement of mirrors, which can be used for both offense and defense. Mirror-Masters' abilities are also enhanced by standing on a mirror; for example, they can perform quick teleports from there or rapidly regenerate their mana. Nevertheless, not all Mirror-Magic requires a physical mirror; many effects rely simply on light or mirror-shards, or on uncertainty, reflection and illusion. The maximum number of Mirrors which can be controlled simultaneously depends on the player's level; sometimes, unnecessary mirrors may need to be broken.

<topic:Psion><color:o>Psion</color>
Psions, like Mindcrafters, rely on their innate mental powers; indeed, some of these powers resemble those of Mindcrafters. Unlike Mindcrafters, though, Psions can select which powers they wish to learn; together with their natural aptitude in a fairly broad range of skills, this makes Psions one of the most versatile classes. Most psionic powers are extremely strong, but the number of powers a Psion can learn is very limited: one each at levels 1, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 40 and 50.

The potency of psionic powers can be scaled up or down as needed, within limits; the more mana is spent, the more powerful the effect. All psionic powers require great concentration, leaving the Psion little time for pets. Psions do not have one fixed spell stat; they can use either Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma, whichever is the highest. In this respect they are truly unique!

<topic:Time-Lord><color:o>Time-Lord</color>
Time-Lords are masters of temporal magic, altering the flow of time to their advantage. They gain new powers as their experience grows, and are unique in their ability to use time-based spells against monsters. Not only do these attacks damage a foe, they also inflict a wide variety of possible effects, from slowing to amnesia, from evolution to devolution, from weakening to stasis. In addition to temporal attacks, Time-Lords gain great powers of speed, and become naturally faster with experience. Legend has it that masters of time can even see into the future, avoiding attacks that would otherwise prove fatal!
 
Time-Lords are fairly proficient with magical devices, but are mediocre fighters and not good at archery at all. At high levels, they become resistant to time. Time-Lords' primary stat is Wisdom.

<topic:Warlock><color:o>Warlock</color>
Warlocks are a magical class; they derive their spells and powers not from books, but from an eldritch pact made with a given class of monsters. This pact is irrevocable and is made at the outset of the Warlock's career. Depending on the class of monsters with whom they ally, the warlock will gain unique bonuses, abilities and magical powers; for example, alliance with the forces of the netherworld grants resistances to poison and nether, enhanced constitution and spells to control and conjure the unliving, as well as spells to access the damaging forces of the netherworld directly. Each such alliance has thematic bonuses and powers, and you can read the details in the respective help sections.

Allying with a given class of monsters dramatically reduces the warlock's ability to fight these foes. Instead, the warlock seeks cooperation with their brethren, or perhaps domination over them; direct assaults are rarely successful.
 
In addition to pact-related spells, all warlocks gain access to the unique power of the Eldritch Blast. Their primary spell stat is Charisma, since they seek dominion and alliance with their chosen kin, and these monsters tend to have a strong will of their own.

See <link:Warlocks.txt> for more details on warlock pacts.

The Archaeologist is an erudite treasure hunter, seeking out the most valuable prizes that the dungeon has to offer. At home in subterranean caverns and vaults, he is rarely lost or snared in traps. His powers of perception and detection are very great, as is his skill with arcane devices. At high levels he can use the dark magic of the entombed Pharaohs. The powers of the Archaeologist are enhanced by Wisdom.

<topic:Bard><color:o>Bard</color>
Bards are traditional musicians, and songs and sound are the foundation of their magic. Four songbooks are available to a Bard, two of them sold in towns. Some songs are over in a quick yelp, consuming no more time than a magic spell would; but most continue to be sung, with continuing effects, until the bard either chooses to stop or runs out of mental energy. A bard can only ever sing one tune at a time. The primary spell stat of a bard is Charisma.

<topic:Imitator><color:o>Imitator</color>
Imitators have enough fighting skills to survive, but rely on their unique technique - 'Imitation' - which imitates monster spells/techniques including their damage and duration. Dexterity determines general imitation ability, but a stat related to the specific action is often also taken into account.
 
To use imitation, Imitators must see monster's spell at first. When a viewable monsters uses a spell, it is added to a temporary spell list which the imitator can choose from. Spells should be imitated quickly, because timing and situation are everything. An imitator can only repeat a spell once each time he observes it. They only have a small long-term memory for spells, which ranges from one to three, depending on their level. When they memorize more spells than this, they will forget the oldest spell in the list. They have a class power - 'Double Revenge' - which allows them to imitate spells at double damage or duration.

Politicians are masters of spinning and manipulation, seeking to convert others to their cause and to destroy those they cannot convert. They are not very good at either direct combat or at using magical devices, and rely on their savvy and special skills and on the help of their friends to win fights. They have the ability to toggle between hit points, wealth and experience as the source of their power, although the latter two only become available at higher levels. Charisma is a key stat for Politicians.

<topic:Rage-Mage><color:o>Rage-Mage</color>
Rage-Mages are part of a secret sect, originally founded by Barbarians in response to their natural foes, the mages. With the passing of time, other races have also begun to study these arts.

Rage techniques are learned from books, but differ from normal spells in many ways. First of all, the Rage-Mage must perform a special Ritual of Anger to learn a power, and this ritual destroys the book; as a result, it may take a long time for the Rage-Mage to learn all of their high-level powers. Books are required only for learning; the powers, once learned, can be used without them.

Another unique aspect of Rage-Mages concerns their mana pool. Rage-Mage mana, unlike that of normal spellcasters, does not regenerate on its own; in fact, it actually decreases rapidly each turn, meaning Rage-Mages had better use their powers quickly while they still can. A Rage-Mage gains mana whenever he is the target of a magical spell; indeed, magic makes a Rage-Mage very angry! Rage-Mages can also fuel their mana by hurting those around them, which can be quite effective in crowded situations.

<topic:Skillmaster><color:o>Skillmaster</color>
The Skillmaster is not your ordinary class. Instead, you may design your own class, on the fly, using a point-based skill system. Upon birth, you will get 5 points to spend; use them wisely to set the basic direction of your class. Every fifth character level, you will receive an additional point to spend, for fifteen points overall. You may use these points to learn melee, to master a spell realm, to improve your speed or stealth, to increase your magic device skills, to gain special techniques, to learn riding, dual-wielding or martial arts... no other class, even Psion or Yeqrezh Disciple, offers as much flexibility.

Most skills allow the investment of multiple points for increased proficiency, but some are abilities that you may buy with a single point (e.g. Luck). This class is not recommended for beginning players, despite being quite strong; you only have a limited amount of points to spend, and your choices are irreversible.

See <link:Skillmasters.txt> for more details on skillmasters.

Wild-Talents gain random talents and abilities as they level up. They are good fighters, and decent with magical devices, but their true forte is their vast array of potential random powers. Except you never know what those might be!
 
Wild-Talents do not have a spell stat. Instead, each ability that they gain requires its own individual stat for the purposes of fail rate calculation; for example, Tossing a Boulder requires Strength, while Magic Missile requires Intelligence. Each spell requires mana to cast, but the amount of mana available is not influenced by any particular stat and is determined simply by experience.
