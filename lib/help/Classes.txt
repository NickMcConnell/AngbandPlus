[[[[B|  The Classes

***** <Warrior>
[[[[r|  Warrior

  A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems by
  cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of a
  magical device.  Unfortunately, many high-level devices may be forever beyond
  their use.
   
  Warriors cast no spells.  They hate magic.  In fact, they even gain
  experience for destroying high level spellbooks.  They have a class power -
  'Sword Dancing' - which allows them to conduct a melee attack in six random
  directions.


***** <Mage>
[[[[r|  Mage

  A Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits as he cannot hope to
  simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. In addition to his
  spellbooks, a Mage should carry a range of magical devices to help him in his
  endeavors which he can master far more easily than anyone else.  A Mage's
  prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
   
  Mages have the least restrictions in choosing and learning spells. They can
  freely choose any two realms when a character is created. Their natural
  inclination makes Life magic fairly hard to learn. Otherwise, a mage tends to
  learn and cast all the spells in his or her realms better than any other
  character.  The ability to choose second realm of magic has a special
  meaning: Only the second realm can be changed in the middle of the game.  You
  can change second realm by studying ('G') from a spellbook of new realm. 
  They have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves
  or rods.


***** <Priest>
[[[[r|  Priest

  A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They explore the
  dungeon in the service of their God. They are fairly familiar with magical
  devices which they believe act as foci for divine intervention in the natural
  order of things. Priests abhor bloodshed, and therefore are not comfortable
  with edged weapons. Wielding one will disrupt their ability to concentrate
  during prayers. A Priest's primary stat is Wisdom.
   
  Priests can select from Life, Death, Daemon, or Crusade as a first realm, and
  choose almost any second realm. However, if they choose a good realm (Life or
  Crusade) for their first realm, then they are precluded from choosing an evil
  realm (Death or Daemon) for their second realm, and vice versa. Priests can
  learn all spells in the selected realms, even if not as efficiently as mages.
  However, when learning spells, priests cannot voluntarily decide which spells
  to study: they are rewarded with new prayers by their patron deities, with no
  money-back satisfaction guarantee. Priests that select a good realm have a
  class power - 'Bless Weapon' - which allows the priest to wield an edged
  weapon without penalty. Priests that select an Evil Realm have a class power
  - 'Evocation' - which damages, scares and banish all monsters in sight.


***** <Rogue>
[[[[r|  Rogue

  A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is capable of
  fighting his way out of a tight spot. Rogues are good at locating hidden
  traps and doors and are masters of disarming traps and picking locks. A rogue
  has a high stealth allowing him to sneak around many creatures without having
  to fight, or to get in a telling first blow. A rogue may also backstab a
  fleeing monster. Rogues also gain shooting bonuses when using a sling.
  Intelligence determines a rogue's spell casting ability.
   
  Rogues can select one realm from Sorcery, Death, Trump, Arcane, Craft, or
  Burglary. Except for this last realm, rogues have certain limitations on
  which spells they can learn, and they do not learn new spells very quickly.
  The Burglary Realm however is unique to the rogue and offers spells for
  setting traps, picking pockets, negotiating with other thieves, and escaping
  from a tight spot. Burglary rogues are agents of the Black Market and receive
  favorable pricing from that shop.


***** <Ranger>
[[[[r|  Ranger

  A Ranger is a combination of a warrior and a mage who has developed a special
  affinity for the natural world around him. He is a good fighter and also
  excellent with a bow. A ranger has good stealth, perception, searching and
  magical resistance. Also, rangers are familiar with magical devices and use
  them well. Wisdom determines a Ranger's spell casting ability.
   
  All rangers are trained in Nature magic, and all of these spells are
  available to them. They even learn these spells almost as fast as mages. They
  can also select a secondary realm (from Sorcery, Chaos, Death, Trump, Arcane,
  and Daemon), but they are slow learners here, and may find themselves unable
  to learn some of the highest level spells. They have a class power - 'Probe
  Monster' - which allows them to know a monster's HP, speed, and experience
  required to evolve.


***** <Paladin>
[[[[r|  Paladin

  A Paladin is a combination of a warrior and a priest. Paladins are very good
  fighters, but not very good at missile weapons. A paladin lacks much in the
  way of abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and magical
  devices but has a decent saving throw due to his divine alliance. Wisdom
  determines a Paladin's success at praying to his deity.
   
  Paladins can select a realm from Life, Crusade, Daemon and Death. Like
  priests, they cannot select which prayers to learn, but are rewarded with new
  prayers by their deities. They can learn all spells, but not as fast as
  priests. They detest paganism so strongly that they will even gain experience
  for destroying high-level pagan spellbooks: 'pagan' means Life or Crusade
  spellbooks for a Death/Daemon Paladin and all spellbooks other than Life or
  Crusade for a Life/Crusade Paladin. Depending on their realm, they have a
  class power - 'Holy Lance' or 'Hell Lance'.


***** <Warrior-Mage>
[[[[r|  Warrior-Mage

  A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross between the
  warrior and mage classes. While their brothers, the rangers, specialize in
  Nature magic and survival skills, true Warrior-Mages attempt to reach the
  best of both worlds. As warriors they are much superior to the usual Mage
  class. Intelligence determines a Warrior-Mage's spell casting ability.
   
  Warrior-mages begin the game with Arcane magic, and they can freely select
  another realm of magic. Although they do not gain new spells as fast as
  regular mages, they will eventually learn every spell in both realms, thus
  making them a very competitive choice for players who appreciate Arcane
  magic. They have two class powers - 'Convert HP to SP' and 'Convert SP to HP'
  - which allow them to heal HP using mana or gain mana using HP.


***** <Chaos-Warrior>
[[[[r|  Chaos-Warrior

  Chaos Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon Lords of Chaos.
  Every Chaos Warrior has a Patron Demon and, when gaining a level, may receive
  a reward from his Patron. He might be healed or polymorphed, his stats could
  be increased, or he might be rewarded with an awesome weapon. On the other
  hand, the Patrons might surround him with monsters, drain his stats or wreck
  his equipment or they might simply ignore him. The Demon Lords of Chaos are
  chaotic and unpredictable indeed. The exact type of reward depends on both
  the Patron Demon (different Demons give different rewards) and chance.
   
  Chaos Warriors can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon. They are not
  interested in any other form of magic. They can learn every spell. They have
  a class power - 'Confusing Light' - which stuns, confuses, and scares all
  monsters in sight.


***** <Monk>
[[[[r|  Monk

  The Monk character class is very different from all other classes. Their
  training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with no armor or
  weapons. To gain the resistances necessary for survival a monk may need to
  wear some kind of armor, but if the armor he wears is too heavy, it will
  severely disturb his martial arts maneuvers. As the monk advances levels,
  new, powerful forms of attack become available. Their defensive capabilities
  increase likewise, but if armour is being worn, this effect decreases. Wisdom
  determines a Monk's spell casting ability.
   
  The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas of magic. They
  select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Trump and Death. They will
  eventually learn all prayers in the discipline of their choice. They have two
  class powers - 'Assume a Posture' and 'Double Attack'. They can choose
  different forms of postures in different situations, and use powerful
  combinations of attacks for the finishing blow.


***** <Mindcrafter>
[[[[r|  Mindcrafter

  The Mindcrafter is a unique class that uses the powers of the mind instead of
  magic. These powers are unique to Mindcrafters, and vary from simple
  extrasensory powers to mental domination of others. Since these powers are
  developed by the practice of certain disciplines, a Mindcrafter requires no
  spellbooks to use them. The available powers are simply determined by the
  character's level. Wisdom determines a Mindcrafter's ability to use mind
  powers.
   
  Mindcrafters gain new mindcrafting powers and their existing ones become
  stronger as they gain levels. They can use their power even when blinded.
  They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which allows them to rapidly
  regenerate their mana.


***** <High-Mage>
[[[[r|  High-Mage

  High-mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of magic and
  learn it very well - much better than the ordinary mage. A high mage's prime
  statistic is intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
   
  For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, High-mages gain
  substantial benefits in the mana costs, power, minimum levels, and failure
  rates of the spells in their speciality realm. They have a class power - 'Eat
  Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves, or rods.
   
  And then, only High-Mages are able to cast Hex spells.


***** <Tourist>
[[[[r|  Tourist

  Tourists have visited this world for the purpose of sightseeing. Their
  fighting skills are bad and they cannot cast powerful spells. They are the
  most difficult class to win the game with. Intelligence determines a
  tourist's spell casting ability.
   
  Tourists are always seeing more of the world to add to their stock of
  information; no other class can compete with their identification skills.
  They have two class powers - 'Take a Photograph' and 'Identify True'. Their
  magic is based on Arcane, and - aside from identify - is very weak indeed.


***** <Imitator>
[[[[r|  Imitator

  Imitators have enough fighting skills to survive, but rely on their unique
  technique - 'Imitation' - which imitates monster spells/techniques including
  their damage and duration. Dexterity determines general imitation ability,
  but a stat related to the specific action is often also taken into account.
   
  To use imitation, Imitators must see monster's spell at first. When a
  viewable monsters uses a spell, it is added to a temporary spell list which
  the imitator can choose from. Spells should be imitated quickly, because
  timing and situation are everything. An imitator can only repeat a spell once
  each time he observes it. They only have a small long-term memory for spells,
  which ranges from one to three, depending on their level. When they memorize
  more spells than this, they will forget the oldest spell in the list. They
  have a class power - 'Double Revenge' - which allows them to imitate spells
  at double damage or duration.


***** <Beastmaster>
[[[[r|  Beastmaster

  Beastmasters are in tune with the minds of the creatures of the world. They
  are very good at riding, and have enough fighting ability. They use monsters
  which have been summoned or dominated as their hands and feet. Beastmasters
  can cast trump magic, and are very good at summoning spells, but they can not
  summon non-living creatures. Charisma determines a Beastmaster's spell
  casting ability.
   
  Beastmasters use Trump magic to make good use of their monster domination and
  riding abilities. They are very good at summoning living creatures, and they
  learn summoning spells quicker than Mages. However, they cannot summon
  non-living creatures. They have two class powers - 'Dominate a Living Thing'
  and 'Dominate Living Things'.


***** <Sorcerer>
[[[[r|  Sorcerer

  Sorcerers are the all-around best magicians, being able to cast any spell
  from most magic realms without having to learn it. On the downside, they are
  the worst fighters in the dungeon, being unable to use any weapon but a
  Wizardstaff.
   
  Sorcerers can cast any spell from any spellbooks of all magic realms with
  'Master' proficiency level without having to learn it. They have a class
  power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods.


***** <Archer>
[[[[r|  Archer

  Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class
  around with any bow, crossbow, or sling. They need a lot of ammunition, but
  will learn how to make it from junk found in the dungeon. An archer is better
  than a warrior at stealth, perception, searching and magical devices.
   
  Archers have a class power - 'Create Ammo' - which creates stones or shots
  from pile of rubble, and arrows and crossbow bolts from bones.


***** <Magic-Eater>
[[[[r|  Magic-Eater

  Magic-Eaters can absorb magic devices, and use these magics as their spells. 
  They are middling-poor at fighting.  A Magic-Eater's prime statistic is
  intelligence.
   
  Magic-Eaters can absorb the energy of wands, staffs, and rods, and can then
  use these magics as if they were carrying all of these absorbed devices. 
  Mana and changes of absorbed devices are regenerated naturally by a
  Magic-Eater's power, and speed of regeneration is influenced by their
  intelligence.  They have a class power - 'Absorb Magic' - which is used to
  absorb magic devices.
   
  Note: Magic-Eaters may now use the resting commands (R* or R&) to
  automatically regenerate all charges the same way that other spellcasters can
  use these commands to regenerate all mana.


***** <Bard>
[[[[r|  Bard

  Bards are something like traditional musicians. Their magical attacks are
  sound-based, and last as long as the Bard has mana. Although a bard cannot
  sing two or more songs at the same time, he or she does have the advantage
  that many songs affect all areas in sight. A bard's prime statistic is
  charisma.
   
  The songs are found in four songbooks, of which two are sold in town. There
  is a special feature of music; many songs continue to be sung until either
  the Bard chooses to stop, or he runs out of the energy required to sing that
  type of song. Bards have a class power - 'Stop Singing'.


***** <Red-Mage>
[[[[r|  Red-Mage

  Red Mages are similar to Warrior-Mage; they are decent fighters and
  spellcasters. Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower rank spellbooks
  of all realms, but they cannot cast spells from higher rank spellbooks, and
  they are extremely slow learners in them. They are not bad at using magical
  devices and magic resistance, but are bad at other skills. A red-mage's prime
  statistic is intelligence.
   
  Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower rank spellbooks of all realms:
  first and second spellbooks of all realms and third and fourth Arcane
  spellbooks, without having to learn it, but they cannot cast spells from
  higher rank spellbooks; third and fourth spellbooks for all realms other than
  Arcane. Since they use all realms at once, they have large penalties in the
  mana costs, minimum levels, and failure rates of spells. They have a class
  power - 'Double Magic' - which allows them to cast two spells at once.


***** <Samurai>
[[[[r|  Samurai

  Samurai, masters of the art of the blade, are the next strongest fighters
  after Warriors, and can use various special combat techniques. Samurai are
  not good at most other skills, and many magical devices may be too difficult
  for them to use. Wisdom determines a Samurai's ability to use the special
  combat techniques available to him.
   
  Samurai use the art of the blade called Kendo (or Bugei). Books of Kendo are
  similar to spellbooks, but Samurai don't need to carry them around; the books
  are needed only when they study new combat techniques. Samurai need a weapon
  wielded to use the techniques of Kendo, and most techniques will add powerful
  special properties to their blows; such as flaming, poisoning, vampiric,
  etc... Their maximum spellpoints don't depend on their level but solely on
  wisdom, and they can use the class power 'Concentration' to temporarily
  increase SP beyond its usual maximum value. They have one more class power -
  'Assume a Posture'. They can choose different forms of posture in different
  situations.


***** <Force-Trainer>
[[[[r|  Force-Trainer

  A ForceTrainer is a master of the spiritual Force. They prefer fighting with
  neither weapon nor armor. They are not as good fighters as are Monks, but
  they can use both magic and the spiritual Force. Wielding weapons or wearing
  heavy armor disturbs use of the Force. Wisdom is a ForceTrainer's primary
  stat.
   
  ForceTrainers use both spellbook magic and the special spiritual power called
  the Force. They can select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Death, and
  Crusade. To use The Force, you select it just as if it were spellbook 'w';
  which means you need to press 'm' and then 'w' to select the Force. The most
  important spell of the Force is 'Improve Force'; each time a ForceTrainer
  activates it, their Force power becomes more powerful, and their attack power
  in bare-handed melee fighting is increased temporarily. The strengthened
  Force can be released at one stroke when a ForceTrainer activates some other
  Force spell, typically an attack spell. They have a class power - 'Clear
  Mind' - which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.


***** <Blue-Mage>
[[[[r|  Blue-Mage

  A Blue-Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits, as he cannot hope
  to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. A major difference
  between the Mage and the Blue-Mage is the method of learning spells:
  Blue-Mages may learn spells from monsters. A Blue-Mage's prime statistic is
  Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
   
  A Blue-Mage can learn and cast monster ranged attacks, spells, or summons as
  their own spells; this technique is called Blue magic. Unlike Imitators,
  Blue-Mages remember their spells permanently, but they must get hit by a
  monster's spell while their class power 'Learning' is active to learn spells.
  Because of this requirement, they do not learn spells, like healing, that
  affect the monster itself.


***** <Cavalry>
[[[[r|  Cavalry

  Cavalry ride on horses into battle. Although they cannot cast spells, they
  are proud of their overwhelming offensive strength on horseback. They are
  good at shooting. At high levels, they learn to forcibly saddle and tame wild
  monsters. Since they take pride in the body and the soul, they don't use
  magical devices well.
   
  Like Warriors and Archers, the cavalry don't use magic. Since they are very
  good at riding, they have a class power - 'Rodeo' - which allows them to
  forcibly saddle and tame wild monsters.


***** <Berserker>
[[[[r|  Berserker

  A Berserker is a fearful fighter indeed, immune to fear and paralysis. At
  high levels, Berserkers can reflect bolt spells with their tough flesh.
  Furthermore, they can fight without weapons, can remove cursed equipment by
  force, and can even use their special combat techniques when surrounded by an
  anti-magic barrier. Berserkers, however, cannot use any magical devices or
  read any scrolls, and are hopeless at all non-combat skills. Since Berserker
  Spectres are quite easy to *win* with, their scores are lowered.
   
  Berserkers use a unique system of techniques called 'Rage'. They gain more
  techniques as they gain levels. They use no magic: indeed, they cannot use
  any magic devices or activate any artifacts, and cannot read scrolls. To
  offset these great disadvantages, Berserkers are allowed to have an important
  class power - 'Recall'.


***** <Weaponsmith>
[[[[r|  Weaponsmith

  A Weaponsmith can improve weapons and armors for him or herself. They are
  good at fighting, and they have potential ability to become even better than
  Warriors using improved equipments. They cannot cast spells, and are poor at
  skills such as stealth or magic defense.
   
  A Weaponsmith extracts the essences of special effects from weapons or armors
  which have various special abilities, and can add these essences to another
  weapon or armor. Normally, each equipment can be improved only once, but they
  can remove a previously added essence from improved equipment to improve it
  with another essence. To-hit, to-damage bonus, and AC can be improved freely
  up to a maximum value depending on level. Weaponsmiths have a class power -
  'Judgment' - which allows them to identify (later *identify*) weapons and
  armor.


***** <Mirror-Master>
[[[[r|  Mirror-Master

  Mirror-Masters are spell casters; like other mages, they must live by their
  wits. They can create magical mirrors, and employ them in the casting of
  Mirror-Magic spells. Intelligence determines a Mirror-Master's spell casting
  ability.
   
  Mirror-Masters gain more spells and each spell becomes more powerful as they
  gain levels. They can use their spells even when blinded. For Mirror-Masters,
  the arrangement of mirrors is very important: Some attack spells reflect from
  mirrors, and some other spells are effective only against monsters standing
  on a mirror. A Mirror-Master standing on a mirror has greater ability and,
  for example, can perform quick teleports. The maximum number of magical
  Mirrors which can be controlled simultaneously depends on the level, and
  breaking unnecessary mirrors is important work for them. They have two class
  powers - 'Break Mirrors', which breaks all mirrors in current dungeon level
  and 'Mirror Concentration', which allows them to rapidly regenerate their
  mana on a mirror.


***** <Ninja>
[[[[r|  Ninja

  A Ninja is a fearful assassin lurking in darkness. He or she can navigate
  effectively with no light source, catch enemies by surprise, and kill with a
  single blow. Ninjas can use Ninjutsu, and are good at locating hidden traps
  and doors, disarming traps and picking locks. Since heavy armors, heavy
  weapons, or shields will restrict their motion greatly, they prefer light
  clothes, and become faster and more stealthy as they gain levels. A Ninja
  knows no fear and, at high level, becomes almost immune to poison and able to
  see invisible things. Dexterity determines a Ninja's ability to use Ninjutsu.
   
  A Ninja can use Ninjutsu for lurking and surprise attacks. They gain more
  Ninjutsu techniques as they gain levels. They have a class power - 'Quick
  Walk' - which makes their walking speed extremely fast.


***** <Sniper>
[[[[r|  Sniper

  Snipers are specialists in marksmanship, but not like archers who fire off
  arrow after arrow in swift succession. They don't just increase accuracy and
  power of shots by concentration, they can use fearsome archery techniques.
   
  What they require is powerful bows or crossbows, good quality ammunition and
  the fortitude to bear up without flinching under any situation.
   
  Snipers know their enemies well and can shoot them from the shadows. They
  have no time for magic.


***** <Time-Lord>
[[[[r|  Time-Lord

  Time-Lords are masters of temporal magic, altering the flow of time to their
  advantage. They don't learn spells from books, but rather gain new powers as
  they grow more experienced. They are the only class that can affect monsters
  with time based attacks. Not only do these damage their foes, but they also
  inflict a wide variety of possible effects, from slowing to amnesia, from
  evolution to devolution, from weakening to stasis. In addition to temporal
  attacks, the Time-Lord gains great powers of speed, and they grow faster with
  experience. It is said that masters of time can even see the future, avoiding
  attacks that would otherwise prove fatal! Also, legend has it that the
  greatest Time-Lords are able to take multiple actions in a single turn.
   
  Time-Lords are mediocre fighters and not good at archery at all. They are OK
  with magical devices, but nowhere near as proficient as are mages. They have
  midling stealth. At high levels, they become resistant to time. The
  Time-Lord's primary magic stat is Wisdom.


***** <Blood-Knight>
[[[[r|  Blood-Knight

  A Blood-Knight is a fighter who has delved into the dark arts and can perform
  a limited number of offensive effects using his own health. In addition to
  the HP cost, using an ability also causes bleeding/wounds, with an amount
  proportional to the cost of the ability. Their primary stat for abilities is
  Con.
   
  Blood-Knights are strong in melee, but are very unusual in the fact that the
  more wounded they are, the stronger they become. When damaged, they gain
  additional melee attacks and damage, and moreso the more wounded and cut they
  become. Indeed, when on the brink of death they are the strongest fighters
  imaginable, and stories of their legendary feats abound. Of course, with
  great power comes great risk of death, and you don't recall ever meeting one
  of these heroes of legend in person!
   
  Since the Blood-Knight relies on their own blood for their power, they are
  restricted to only certain races. No non-living race may walk the red path.


***** <Warlock>
[[[[r|  Warlock

  A Warlock, unlike typical mages, derives his powers from pacts with arcane
  creatures, rather than through careful study. Warlocks possess the unique
  offensive power of the Eldritch Blast, and they use this without paying any
  sort of mana or hitpoint costs (though they still have fail rates). The
  Warlock's primary spell stat is Charisma, and this directly influences the
  damage of their Eldritch Blast.
   
  Each Warlock makes a pact with a single type of creature: Undead, Dragons,
  Angels, Demons or Aberrations. This pact confers both advantages and
  disadvantages. For one thing, Warlocks are very ineffective when fighting
  monsters with whom they have formed an alliance. Every form of damage is
  actually reduced by a substantial amount, and this makes killing pact
  monsters extremely difficult. Probably, the Warlock should avoid fighting
  these monsters altogether. Indeed, at high levels pact monsters are often
  friendly to the warlock, but some fights cannot be avoided it seems. That's
  the bad news. The good news is that each pact confers unique abilities and
  powers to the warlock. These benefits reflect the nature of the pact monster.
  For example, a pact with Undead confers resistance to Poison and Nether as
  well as Hold Life, among other things. A pact with Dragons confers the power
  to resist the elements as well as strong melee (Warlocks are generally poor
  fighters otherwise). In addition, each pact gives a unique high level
  offensive power when using their Eldritch Blast.


***** <Archaeologist>
[[[[r|  Archaeologist

  The Archaeologist is an erudite treasure hunter, seeking out the most
  valuable prizes that the dungeon has to offer. At home in subterranean
  caverns and vaults, he is rarely lost or snared in traps. His powers of
  perception and detection are very great, as is his skill with arcane devices.
  At high levels he can use the dark magic of the entombed Pharaohs. The powers
  of the Archaeologist are enhanced by Wisdom.


***** <Duelist>
[[[[r|  Duelist

  The duelist is the ultimate one-on-one fighter, but finds himself at a severe
  disadvantage when facing numerous strong foes. When facing an enemy, the
  duelist first issues a challenge, marking that foe for a one on one duel. Of
  course, this wakes the monster up (There is no honor in dueling a sleeping
  enemy). And while the duelist will honor the fight as a one on one affair,
  many monsters have no such scruples.
   
  Against a challenged foe, the duelist is very strong gaining a bonus to
  saving throws, armor class, damage reduction and combat prowess. On the other
  hand, due to the single-mindedness of their focus, the duelist is quite
  vulnerable to unchallenged opponents. Most of the techniques of this class
  aim at enforcing the sanctity of the duel.
   
  The duelist only ever gains a single attack in combat, but they make the most
  of this blow by gaining enhanced effects as they gain experience. Able to
  wound, stun, and even hamstring their foes, the prowess of the duelist in a
  one on one encounter is legendary!
   
  Duelists favor light armors and cannot equip a shield. They gain no extra
  bonus when wielding a weapon with both hands. For their techniques the
  duelist relies on dexterity.


***** <Wild-Talent>
[[[[r|  Wild-Talent

  The Wild-Talent gains random talents and abilities as they level up.  They
  are good fighters, and decent with magical devices, but their true forte is
  their vast array of potential random powers.  Except you never know what
  those might be!


***** <Rune-Knight>
[[[[r|  Rune-Knight

  The Rune Knight is a mythical warrior-mage who is dedicated to the power of
  ancient Runes that hold immense power.  By affixing these Runes to his
  equipment, the Rune Knight can become an avatar of destruction, or an
  invulnerable bastion.  Unlike the Warrior-Mage and all other casters, the
  Rune Knight's mana does not regenerate on its own; rather, the Rune Knight
  must siphon mana from magical attacks directed at him.  The Rune Knight has a
  fixed (though very large) selection of spells that he can use his mana on, in
  addition to his unique Rune spells.


***** <Weaponmaster>
[[[[r|  Weaponmaster

  The weaponmaster is great with a single class of weapons. The character gets
  combat bonuses and special powers depending on the type of specialization.
  Alas, the weaponmaster is truly lousy when using any weapon outside their
  chosen specialty so focus is key.


***** <Blood-Mage>
[[[[r|  Blood-Mage

  A Blood Mage is similar to a normal mage in his selection and variety of
  spells, but differs in that he has no separate mana pool.  Instead, all his
  spells are powered by his health.  Moreover, due to the Blood Mage's abnormal
  constitution, all healing is much less effective than normal. In fact, the
  Blood Mage completely eschews all healing magic as this disrupts the flow of
  blood that is the essence of their power. They completely shun the realm of
  Life as anathema to all that is sacred.


***** <Necromancer>
[[[[r|  Necromancer

  A Necromancer attempts to gain both power and knowledge through communion
  with the dead. They use powerful necromancy magic to summon aid from the
  dead, whether directly in terms of undead servitude, or indirectly through
  other-worldly knowledge. Necromancy also offers myriad foul offensive spells,
  but all of these require the Necromancer to physically touch his foe. To do
  so, the Necromancer may wield neither weapon, nor gloves. But a powerful
  necromancer is truly awe inspiring, and may even kill foes with a single
  deadly touch! In addition, they forever hunt for the legendary Eye and Hand
  of Vecna in order to complete their power.


***** <Psion>
[[[[r|  Psion

  The Psion is like a Mindcrafter, and uses innate mental powers. Unlike the
  Mindcrafter, however, Psions have the freedom to learn powers that enforce
  their own styles. They learn very few powers, but they can scale their powers
  to determine the SP cost and the powers' potency. Psionic powers require
  great concentration, however, and psions do not have the mind to spare to
  care for others. The Psion gains powers a the following levels: 1, 10, 15,
  20, 30, 35, 40 and 50. The Psion uses Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma as
  their primary spell stat, which ever is currently highest. In this respect,
  Psions are truly unique!


***** <Rage-Mage>
[[[[r|  Rage-Mage

  The Rage Mage is part of a secret sect descending from the Barbarians in
  response to their natural foes, the mages. As time passed, other races have
  also begun to learn their arts. The powers of the Rage Mage are spells
  learned from books, but they don't work the way normal spells do. First of
  all, the Rage Mage must perform a special Ritual of Anger to learn a spell,
  and this ritual destroys the spell book in the process. As a result, it may
  take a long time for the Rage Mage to learn all of their high level powers.
  Once learned, the Rage Mage no longers requires the spell book in order to
  perform the power.
   
  Another unique aspect of the Rage Mage concerns their Mana pool. Unlike
  normal spellcasters, the Rage Mage's mana does not regenerate on its own. In
  fact, their mana actually decreases rapidly each turn, meaning that they had
  better use their powers quickly while they still can. The Rage Mage gains
  mana whenever he is the target of a magical spell. Indeed, magic makes the
  Rage Mage very angry! The Rage Mage can also fuel their mana by hurting those
  around them. This can be quite effective in crowded situations.


***** <Scout>
[[[[r|  Scout

  The scout is the vanguard of any attack, and excels at stealth and
  observation skills. The scout is not the best at one-on-one combat, but is
  unparalleled at ambush techniques to destroy groups of weak sentries. The
  scout is lightly armored, and heavy armors disrupt their abilities.
  Furthermore, the scout can only effectively dodge in open areas, being
  confined severely hampers the scout's defensive abilities.


***** <Mauler>
[[[[r|  Mauler

  The Mauler favors extremely heavy weapons, and possesses powerful abilities
  whose effectiveness depends on the weight of the weapon. While they only gain
  a limited number of blows which can never be magically increased, they are
  capable of hitting opponents very hard to make the most of each strike. The
  Mauler is required to use both hands on a single weapon when wielding if they
  wish their talents to function properly.


***** <Mystic>
[[[[r|  Mystic

  Mystics are masters of bare handed fighting, like Monks. However, they do not
  learn normal spells. Instead, they gain mystical powers with experience, and
  these powers directly influence their martial arts. In this respect, Mystics
  are similar to the Samurai. Indeed, they even concentrate to boost their mana
  like the Samurai. Mystics eschew weapons of any kind and require the lightest
  of armors in order to practice their martial arts. The number of attacks are
  influenced by dexterity and experience level while the mystic's mana and fail
  rates are influenced by charisma. Mystics are in tune with the natural forces
  around them and may even call on aid when necessary. It has been whispered
  that mystics have even discovered how to kill an opponent with a single
  touch, though they do not share this knowledge with novices.


***** <Devicemaster>
[[[[r|  Devicemaster

  Devicemasters are excellent with magical devices, but poor in most other
  skills. They may shoot or use melee in a pinch, but this will never be their
  forte. Instead, they must rely on their arsenal of magical devices in order
  to survive.
   
  The Devicemaster chooses to specialize in a particular class of devices and
  they gain extra bonuses when using devices from their speciality. These
  bonuses include increased damage, increased speed of activation, extra
  resistance to charge draining, and even the ability to occasionally power
  these devices without consuming charges. Each of these abilities becomes
  greater with experience.
   
  Devicemasters have a few magical abilities to enhance their utility with
  devices. As expected, they gain a powerful talent of Recharging very early
  on. Also, they may detect magical devices from a distance. At higher levels,
  they gain the powerful ability to move charges from one device to another
  without the risk of destroying the target device. As a final ability, the
  Devicemaster may use multiple charges at once from a given device in an act
  of desperation. This greatly increases the power of the effect, but may
  destroy the device in the process.
