<style:title>The Dungeon</style><tab:40><indent><screenshot:dungeon01></indent>

Although the game contains an extensive town level featuring multiple towns and a large wilderness area, the bulk of your adventuring will take place in the dungeon. Symbols appearing on your screen will represent the dungeon's walls, floor, objects, features, and creatures lurking about. In order to direct your character through his adventure, you will enter single character commands (see command.txt <link:command.txt>).

<topic:MapSymbols><style:heading>Symbols On Your Map</style>

Symbols on your map can be broken down into three categories: Features of the dungeon such as walls, floor, doors, and traps; Objects which can be picked up such as treasure, weapons, magical devices, etc; and creatures which may or may not move about the dungeon, but are mostly harmful to your character's well being.

Some symbols are used to represent more than one type of entity, and some symbols are used to represent entities in more than one category. The "@" symbol (by default) is used to represent the character.

It will not be necessary to remember all of the symbols and their meanings. The "slash" command (<color:keypress>/</color>) will identify any character appearing on your map.

<style:note>Note that you can use a <color:keyword>user pref file</color> to change any of these symbols to something you are more comfortable with.</style>

<topic:WithinDungeon><style:heading>Within The Dungeon</style>

Once your character is adequately supplied with food, light, armor, and weapons, he is ready to enter the dungeon. Move on top of the <$:FF_ENTRANCE> symbol and use the <color:keyword>Down</color> command (<color:keypress>></color>).

Note that the game engine supports multiple concurrent dungeon levels, and processes them as needed. This means that as your character approaches those stairs, the level already has been generated and monsters may "wake up" and hunt the player, leaving their current level to pursue you up the stairs. So while you might feel safe now, since nothing nasty is lurking nearby, stair cases are always a bit of a wildcard. Also, levels are not re-generated if you leave and then come back. Rather, game levels are persistent (for a while, at least ... distant levels do eventually get garbage collected after which re-visitation will generate a new level). This gives a much more realistic game experience.

In the dungeon, there are many things to find, but your character must survive many horrible and challenging encounters to find the treasure lying about and take it safely back to the town to sell.

There are two sources for light once inside the dungeon. Permanent light which has been magically placed within rooms, and a light source carried by the player. If neither is present, the character will be unable to see. This will affect searching, picking locks, disarming traps, reading scrolls, casting spells, browsing books, etc. So be very careful not to run out of light!

A character must wield a torch or lamp in order to supply his own light. A torch or lamp burns fuel as it is used, and once it is out of fuel, it stops supplying light. You will be warned as the light approaches this point. You may use the "Fuel" command (<color:keypress>F</color>) to refuel your lantern (with flasks of oil) or your torch (with other torches), so it is a good idea to carry extra torches or flasks of oil, as appropriate. There are rumors of objects of exceptional power which glow with their own never-ending light.

<topic:Objects><style:heading>Objects In The Dungeon</style>

The dungeons are full of objects just waiting to be picked up and used. How did they get there? Well, the main sources for useful items are all the foolish adventurers that proceeded into the dungeon before you. They get killed, and the helpful creatures scatter the various treasure throughout the dungeon. Most cursed items are placed there by the joyful evil sorcerers, who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.

A more complete description of objects is found elsewhere in the documentation (see <link:objects.txt>).

<topic:Mining><style:heading>Mining</style><tab:40><indent><screenshot:dungeon02></indent>

Much of the treasure within the dungeon can be found only by mining it out of the walls. Many rich strikes exist within each level, but must be found and mined. Quartz veins are the richest, yielding the most metals and gems, but magma veins will have some hordes hidden within.

Mining is rather difficult without a pick or shovel. Picks and shovels have an additional magical ability expressed as '(+#)'. The higher the number, the better the magical digging ability of the tool. A pick or shovel also has plusses to hit and damage, and can be used as a weapon, because, in fact, it is one.

When a vein of quartz or magma is located, the character may wield his pick or shovel and begin digging out a section. When that section is removed, he can locate another section of the vein and begin the process again. Since granite rock is much harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the vein exactly and dig around the granite. There is an option for highlighting magma and quartz. At a certain point, it becomes more cumbersome to dig out treasure than to simply kill monsters and discover items in the dungeon to sell. However, early on mineral veins can be a wonderful source of easy treasure.

If the character has a scroll, staff, or spell of treasure location, he can immediately locate all strikes of treasure within a vein shown on the screen. This makes mining much easier and more profitable.

Note that a character with high strength and/or a heavy weapon does not need a shovel/pick to dig, but even the strongest character will benefit from a pick if trying to dig through a granite wall.

It is sometimes possible to get a character trapped within the dungeon by using various magical spells and items. So it can be a good idea to always carry some kind of digging tool, even when you are not planning on tunneling for treasure.

There are rumors of certain incredibly profitable rooms buried deep in the dungeon and completely surrounded by titanium and granite walls, requiring a digging implement or magical means to enter. The same rumors imply that these rooms are guarded by incredibly powerful monsters, so beware!

<topic:StairsDoorsEtc><style:heading>Staircases, Secret Doors, Passages, and Rooms</style>

Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper or climb out of the dungeon. The symbols for the up and down staircases are the same as the commands to use them. A "<$:FF_STAIRS_UP>" represents an up staircase and a "<$:FF_STAIRS_DOWN>" represents a down staircase. You must move your character over the staircase before you can use it.

Each level has at least one up staircase and at least two down staircases. There are no exceptions to this rule. You may have trouble finding some well hidden secret doors, or you may have to dig through obstructions to get to them, but you can always find the stairs if you look hard enough. Stairs, like titanium walls, and the doors into shops, cannot be destroyed by any means.

Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse and demoralize adventurers foolish enough to enter. But with some luck, and lots of concentration, you can find these secret doors. Secret doors will sometimes hide rooms or corridors, or even entire sections of that level of the dungeon. Sometimes they simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends. Secret doors always look like granite walls, just like traps always look like normal floors.

Creatures in the dungeon will generally know and use these secret doors, and can often be counted on to leave them open behind them when they pass through.

Doors can be broken down by bashing them. Once a door is bashed open, it is forever useless and cannot be closed.

<topic:Feelings><style:heading>Level Feelings</style>

Once you have been on a particular dungeon level for a while, you will receive a 'feeling' prompt representing what your intuition tells you about the quality of objects and the difficulty of the monsters found on that level. You may check this prompt again at any time after receiving it by pressing 'Ctrl-F'.

The actual 'feeling' prompt is generated based on a number of factors. Things which increase the feeling level include the presence of vaults and certain other special rooms, out of depth objects and monsters and objects of a certain quality (for example, ego items, artifacts and other objects that are considered 'great' (see <link:objects.txt>)). A feeling is only indicative of the level at the time you entered it and has no impact on subsequent monsters generated or items dropped.

In the game, the nastier the feeling prompt, the better the level. From worst to best, the prompts are as follows:

     <color:w>'What a boring place...'</color>
     <color:w>'This level looks reasonably safe.'</color>
     <color:W>'You don't like the look of this place.'</color>
     <color:U>'You feel your luck is turning...'</color>
     <color:y>'You feel nervous.'</color>
     <color:o>'You have a bad feeling...'</color>
     <color:R>'You have a very bad feeling...'</color>
     <color:r>'This level looks very dangerous.'</color>
     <color:v>'You nearly faint as horrible visions of death fill your mind!'</color>

If your personality is 'Lucky' or you have the mutation of 'white aura', the prompts will be changed as follows:

     <color:w>'What a boring place...'</color>
     <color:w>'This level can't be all bad...'</color>
     <color:W>'You like the look of this place...'</color>
     <color:U>'You feel your luck is turning...'</color>
     <color:y>'You feel strangely lucky...'</color>
     <color:o>'You have a good feeling...'</color>
     <color:R>'You have a very good feeling...'</color>
     <color:r>'You have an excellent feeling...'</color>
     <color:v>'You have a superb feeling about this level.'</color>

There are also two other feeling prompts to denote special things. If you have not yet been on a level long enough to qualify for a prompt and press 'Ctrl-F', you will be given the prompt:

     <color:s>'Looks like any other level.'</color>

If you are playing in non-preserve mode, you may also occasionally receive the following prompt:

     <color:B>'You feel there is something special about this level.'</color>

A special feeling means one of two things, there is either a special room or vault on the level or there is an artifact on the level. As you get deeper on the dungeon, special feelings become increasingly less common for special room and vaults and are only commonly given when an artifact has been generated. Note it is possible that there could be both a vault and an artifact or more than one artifact on a special level so you should never leave a special level without fully exploring it unless your character's continued survival is in question.

<topic:RandomQuests><style:heading>Random Quests</style>

If you are playing <color:keyword>The World of Amber</color>, then you will encounter a fixed number of random quests in the dungeon of Amber. By default, each quest is to kill a certain out of depth unique monster, though you may change this to kill a certain number of a random type of monster with a birth option <link:option.txt#Birth>. Be warned: unique monsters are generally powerful for their native depths, so fighting them out of depth is especially difficult!

On random quest levels, no down staircases are generated until the last monster is killed which means that you cannot continue further into the dungeon until you have completed your quests. When you kill the quest monster, the down staircase will be created and the monster will drop an item of 'excellent' quality or above. This is true even of monsters that do not normally drop items.

The random quests in Amber will appear on random levels, so you won't be able to know or guess when they might happen. Quests must be completed when they are encountered and retreat is no longer an option (unless you don't mind failing the quest).

<color:keyword>The World of Middle Earth</color> currently does not have any quests.
