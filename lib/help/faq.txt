<style:title>FrogComposband FAQ</style>

<color:G>Q:</color> I'd like to move one square at a time, but every time I press a key my character moves halfway across the screen. Help!

<color:R>A:</color> You are somehow triggering the Run command instead of the Walk command. In addition to normal running (with the '.' command), FrogComposband uses preference files to support shiftrunning (running by using the Shift key), which is preferred by some players. This mechanic sometimes leads to unwanted running, especially on the angband.live online server which has some very odd default settings. If you are playing there, see if toggling Num Lock helps you stop running, turn on the online_macros option in the Input Options menu (the '=' key), or else request help in the server chat.


<color:G>Q:</color> All right, I have a character up and walking. What should I do?

<color:R>A:</color> First of all, you will want things that help your character survive difficult situations - either cheap healing potions (cure light/cure serious wounds), or escape scrolls (phase door/teleportation), or ideally both. These are sold at the Temple (shop <color:g>4</color>) and the Alchemy Shop (shop <color:b>5</color>). After that, you'll probably want to either explore a dungeon (Warrens, in Outpost, is the easiest and the usual starter dungeon) or request and complete one of the early quests. While the Thieves' Hideout quest is marked as level 5, for all but the weakest characters it is doable at the very beginning of the game, at least with a bit of luck and a cure wounds potion or two.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I access the Thieves' Hideout quest?

<color:R>A:</color> In Outpost, walk to the large building just outside the city walls and press 'q' to request a quest from the Count. Then walk to the building in the northeast of the city and press '>' at the quest entrance.


<color:G>Q:</color> Where do I find the other quests in the game?

<color:R>A:</color> All quests are offered by some building in some town, apart from the two (Oberon and Serpent) that you start with, and the ten random level-guardian quests in the Angband dungeon. Most quests have special entrances, which can be found in towns or their immediate vicinity. (If you can't spot the entrance visually, press the ']' key (or Ctrl-O) to display the object list; it also displays nearby entrances.) The entrances only appear after you request the quest.

A small number of quests are offered by towns but appear in dungeons. The first of these is Pest Control (offered by the Count after you've completed Thieves' Hideout), which is located on level 5 of the Warrens dungeon, or level 5 of Angband in coffee-break mode and no-wilderness mode.


<color:G>Q:</color> What is "coffee-break mode"? How does it differ from normal play?

<color:R>A:</color> Coffee-break mode is a quicker, simpler and more streamlined version of the game. There is no wilderness, only one town (the "Light Town" version of Outpost) and only one dungeon (Angband). Experience gain (and many forms of proficiency gain) are greatly accelerated, monster drops are improved, and the player receives bonus fame for reforging purposes. All stairs in the dungeon are two-level shafts, and forced descent is turned on. Small levels generate more often in the early part of the game, but become rarer (and less small) towards the endgame. Unlike normal forced-descent play, the player is allowed to recall back to town, as well as to skip random dungeon quests by recalling (although recalling out of a quest incurs a large fame penalty).

Coffee-break mode is a birth option; it is automatically turned on for players who select the 'Beginner' option at character creation, but can also be selected the normal way by non-beginners. Coffee-break mode is not an easy-mode; it is activated for beginners because it is simpler and allows faster progress, not because it is easy.


<color:G>Q:</color> I can't find any up staircases, only down staircases! Is there any way I can get back to town?

<color:R>A:</color> In coffee-break mode (and Beginner mode), up staircases never generate, but you can return to Outpost by reading a scroll of Word of Recall (or using the 'Recall' class power on a Berserker). Be careful not to run out of scrolls; if you start running low, buy a few more at the Temple or the Alchemy Shop. (If all else fails, you can hope to find a scroll in the dungeon.)

In pure forced-descent mode, up staircases never generate and recalling is disabled, so you do not have any way to return to the surface once you've left it.

In normal play every down staircase is matched by an up staircase, so you can simply walk back, though recalling is still usually faster.


<color:G>Q:</color> I keep dying! What am I doing wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> Don't worry - this is an expected part of the development curve for new players, and even experienced roguelike veterans die a lot (with the possible exception of the player nicknamed "clouded"!) Learn from your mistakes - if a situation got you killed, avoid getting in that situation again, or make sure you have the supplies to keep you alive if something similar does happen again. Do not rely too much on items with a fail rate - the game is long, and if you take too many chances you will fail at the wrong time eventually. Try to avoid situations where you are one fail away from death.
   
At the same time, it is much better to have an item that saves you 97% of the time than to not have that item! In particular, Staves of Teleport are a key helper that will often get you out of a tough spot; unlike scrolls of teleportation, staves can be used while confused, which is often critical in the early midgame before the player acquires resistance to confusion.

Learn to know the monsters, develop strategies appropriate to their strengths and weaknesses, and avoid fights with enemies too strong for you.


<color:G>Q:</color> I want to play with the strongest possible race/class combination. Which one is that?

<color:R>A:</color> It's hard to say what the strongest class is, both because there are so many (with different strengths and approaches) and because some classes (like berserkers) are strong in the early game and not so strong later, while others (like psions, an extremely powerful endgame class) have the opposite curve. Ninjas are often used as an example of a strong class, and while it's very debatable whether they are the strongest, they do have the advantage of steady development that keeps them powerful through all phases of the game. The same thing could be said of weaponsmiths.

Demigods and Amberites are two of the most powerful races, but they also have a very steep leveling-up penalty, which can be a significant drawback if you want to go places fast. The "plain" human is actually a surprisingly powerful pick, since humans level up very fast but still get two demigod powers at levels 20 and 40.

At the opposite end, yeek tourists and snotling tourists are extremely weak combinations, used by players looking for the ultimate challenge.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I put arrows (or other projectiles) in my quiver?

<color:R>A:</color> First press 'w' (the "wear"/"wield" command) to equip the quiver, then press 'w' again to put the arrows in the quiver.


<color:G>Q:</color> The game is offering me a stat-up. What should I invest in?

<color:R>A:</color> Choose a statistic your character needs; for example, on a melee character you'll want to improve either your strength or dexterity first, and constitution will also help you. If the base for one of your key stats is exactly 18, you'll probably want to improve that stat, because improvements get larger and more significant above 18. Do not invest too much in any one stat, though; the improvements become much smaller again as a statistic approaches its cap level.


<color:G>Q:</color> The game is offering me a demigod power. Which one should I pick?

<color:R>A:</color> It depends on what your character needs; take your time to read the descriptions of all the powers to see which one suits you best. Generally, though, Evasion, Unyielding and Fleet of Foot are all very strong options and are good "default" picks if you don't feel comfortable selecting something more exotic.


<color:G>Q:</color> I have found lots of cool items, but the monsters I meet keep destroying them! Am I doing something wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> Elemental resists help protect your inventory. With one level of resistance, the chances of an item being destroyed by that element are significantly reduced; with two levels of resistance, the item will only be destroyed if you're really unlucky; with three levels of resistance the item will be safe. Watch out for fire, acid, cold and electricity in the early game, and also chaos in the late game. Sound and shards can destroy potions.

If you don't have the appropriate resist and don't want to risk losing the item, avoid monsters that might destroy it; or, if they only destroy items in melee, avoid melee and kill them with ranged attacks.

Note that the armor you wear will always be susceptible to damage from acid attacks - regardless of your acid resistance level - unless you have immunity to acid. This can be really annoying in the early game; by the late game you'll mostly wear artifacts or excellent items that cannot be harmed by acid.


<color:G>Q:</color> I got bored in Outpost so I headed into the wilderness... and I'm still there searching endlessly down one road after another looking for a town.  Where are other towns and dungeons?

<color:R>A:</color> You need to use the global wilderness map (press the < key on the ground level).  This gives you a scaled map of the world (often called the "overworld map"), where you can travel to other towns and dungeons more easily.  It is possible to reach any location in the game without using the overworld map (most roads do lead somewhere); but such an approach will take you much longer and also entail more risk, since monsters won't attack you as often if you travel through the overworld map.


<color:G>Q:</color> I cannot access the overworld map. What's wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> You are either playing in no-wilderness mode, which has no overworld map, or there is a monster nearby and the game won't let you escape too easily by entering the overworld. Coffee-break mode forces no-wilderness play. Selecting 'Beginner' (instead of 'Normal') at character creation forces coffee-break mode (and consequently no-wilderness play), which sometimes confuses players who've seen or heard about the game and expect a wilderness.


<color:G>Q:</color> I keep getting ambushed in the wilderness! How do I survive?

<color:R>A:</color> Take enough Scrolls of Teleportation with you (or a Teleport staff), and some form of healing (like potions of cure serious wounds or cure critical wounds) for emergencies. Avoid high-level wilderness (like mountains or deep seas, or the areas around high-level dungeons) until you know your character can survive there. Daytime travelling is somewhat safer than travelling at night, as ambushes are more likely at night and approaching dangerous monsters are easier to spot in daylight. Characters with low stealth are also more likely to be ambushed.


<color:G>Q:</color> I tried to reach a dungeon through the overworld, and the overworld map says I should be right on top of it; yet when I go to the normal map I can't see a dungeon entrance anywhere. What's wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> Dungeon entrances in the wilderness can sometimes be tricky to locate because one square on the overworld map corresponds to a fairly large area on the normal map. If you exit the overworld map in the right square but the entrance is still far enough away to be out of sight, the game will tell you which direction it's in (e.g. "The Angband entrance doesn't appear to be within sight. Perhaps it's a bit further to the east?"). If no such hint appears, the entrance is within sight, you've just missed it; press ] or O (the object list commands) to see where it is. If such a hint does appear, explore the nearby area in the direction indicated, pressing ] or O occasionally to make sure you don't miss the entrance. If you feel you've walked a long way and still can't find the entrance, check the overworld map to confirm you haven't moved out of the right area, and then try again.


<color:G>Q:</color> I want to play as an Android, Balrog, Golem, Skeleton, Zombie, Spectre, or Ent.  But I can't find any scrolls of satisfy hunger. And Berserkers no longer have racial ability of satisfy hunger. How do I avoid starvation?

<color:R>A:</color> Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger and the Berserker ability of Satisfy Hunger are obsoleted, and races which previously relied on Satisfy Hunger have new sources of nutrition now. Androids can quaff oil.  Balrogs can sacrifice human corpses using the 'E'at command.  Golems, Skeletons, Zombies, and Spectres can absorb mana from staves and wands using the 'E'at command.  Ents can gain enough nutrition from potions.


<color:G>Q:</color> I'm playing as a berserker, and cannot read scrolls.  How do I remove a curse?

<color:R>A:</color> You can simply 't'ake off the cursed equipment.  Since cursed items will attempt to stick, you may need to try the 't'ake off command more than once.


<color:G>Q:</color> I know Berserkers cannot use scrolls, and rods.  How do I recall from dungeon?  Maybe I need to travel completely on foot!?

<color:R>A:</color> Berserkers gain the class power 'Recall' at level 10.  Press 'U' (original keyset) or 'O' (Roguelike keyset) to use class powers.


<color:G>Q:</color> Why do Ninjas start the game with Iron Spikes?

<color:R>A:</color> Ninjas (and Ninja-Lawyers) can use Iron Spikes as shuriken; use the 'v' command to throw a spike. (Other classes can also use spikes as throwing weapons, but will only do marginal damage; they are much more useful for a ninja.)


<color:G>Q:</color> I'm at normal speed (+0). But normal speed monsters sometimes double-move me!

<color:R>A:</color> In FrogComposband, the amount of energy needed for a move is somewhat randomized (though less so than in its predecessor PosChengband). This method of speed system is an important feature of FrogComposband and simulates real fighting. Usually a monster with the same speed as you will only get one move in, but always prepare for the possibility that they might get two moves! Don't fight when your HP is low unless you have a death wish.

Also, monsters don't always move at their listed speed; watch out in particular for hasted monsters, who receive a temporary +10 speed bonus. Non-unique monsters are born with somewhat random speeds, and might be faster or slower than the average monster of their race. (Probing such a monster will reveal its individual speed.)


<color:G>Q:</color> How important is my speed, anyway?

<color:R>A:</color> Speed is incredibly important, especially in the early game when you don't have much of it and it's hard to come by. A character with +10 speed does everything twice as fast as a character with +0 speed. If you survive to the late game, however, you may eventually start hitting diminishing returns for speed; the difference between +30 speed and +40 speed is only ten percent. Potions of Speed, and in the late game Staves of Speed and Rods of Heroic Speed, are extremely useful items you should ideally always have.


<color:G>Q:</color> I've reached the town of Anambar, and can't find a home there. Do I not have a home in Anambar?

<color:R>A:</color> Locate the Police Station and complete the quest they offer. You will receive a home as a reward. (However, Zul is a town where you really don't have a home.)


<color:G>Q:</color> I'm seeing "empty" rings or amulets that seem to do absolutely nothing. Is there any point to them, or are they just flavor?

<color:R>A:</color> Empty rings and amulets are not directly useful, but they can be used as the base item for a potentially useful artifact reforge.


<color:G>Q:</color> I put a Ring of Combat on my finger, but it doesn't seem to do anything, what's wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> Melee rings, like Rings of Combat, only affect the weapon in the corresponding hand; so a Ring of Combat worn on your right hand only affects the weapon in your right hand (if any), and a Ring of Combat worn on your left hand only affects the weapon in your left hand. (If you wield a single weapon with both hands, both rings will apply to it.)


<color:G>Q:</color> How does Free Action work in FrogComposband?

<color:R>A:</color> Free Action provides protection from paralysis, a potentially lethal condition. One level of Free Action provides partial protection and helps recover faster if you do get paralyzed; two levels of Free Action provide complete protection against low-level monsters and very good protection against high-level monsters; three levels of Free Action provide complete protection against paralysis, except in the special case of the Ancient Foul Curse.

How good "imperfect" Free Action (one level of protection in the early game, or one or two levels in the late game) is depends on the level of the attacking monster, and also on your saving throw. The better your saving throw is, the less of a risk you're taking by not having three levels of Free Action.

In many other Angband variants one source of Free Action is enough to give complete paralysis immunity; if you've played such variants, be careful not to rely too much on a single Free Action source in FrogComposband.


<color:G>Q:</color> Is there any way to gain paralysis immunity even against the Ancient Foul Curse?

<color:R>A:</color> A good saving throw improves your chances of not being paralyzed by the curse. With a sufficiently good saving throw the chances of being paralyzed by the curse become zero. Anti-Magic items push your saving throw up to this level, but can be inconvenient for characters that rely heavily on magic.


<color:G>Q:</color> How does See Invisible work in FrogComposband?

<color:R>A:</color> Every level of See Invisible improves your chances of noticing an invisible creature. How good those chances become depends on the level of the monster (high-level monsters are harder to see) and on your Searching skill. Sometimes an invisible creature flickers in and out of sight - now you make the sight roll, the next turn you don't. If you have several sources of See Invisible and still have trouble seeing invisible creatures, you may need either Telepathy or an item that improves your Searching skill.


<color:G>Q:</color> I tried to dual wield two weapons. But I couldn't hit anything!

<color:R>A:</color> You need to practice your dual-wielding skill (proficiency level) and your weapon skills.  Hitting high level monsters many times will improve your skills.  Note that the information command '~' reveals your proficiency levels.  Some classes are very bad at dual-wielding, while others are much more adept at it or can become so with enough training. If you try to dual-wield on a sniper and it doesn't work out, don't let that discourage you from dual-wielding on a ninja.

Wearing gloves of Genji or gaining the Ambidexterity demigod talent will give you bonuses to dual-wielding (though these bonuses will not stack with each other). Sword-speciality Weaponmasters will also receive a dual-wielding bonus once they reach level 45.

Dual-wielding works best with relatively light weapons. Even fully proficient dual-wielders will struggle to hit high-AC monsters with a heavy weapon such as a Lance. Of course, even if a weapon's damage output is limited, it could still be worth wielding for the resists and bonuses on it!


<color:G>Q:</color> What about wielding one weapon with both hands? Is that a good idea?

<color:R>A:</color> From a purely melee-damage point of view, it is usually your best option: wielding a single weapon with both hands improves your damage and accuracy, and unless your blows per round are maxed out anyway you will also receive more blows. The downside is that you effectively have one fewer equipment slot, and miss out on the AC, stat bonuses, resists etc. that a shield or second weapon in that slot would give. Whether this is a good trade depends on your character, how much you gain, and how much you give up. A fairly typical approach is to wield your weapon with both hands until you find a good shield somewhere in the dungeon, and then stop.

Many light weapons (specifically, those that weigh less than 10 pounds and are not polearms) cannot be wielded two-handed, and should always be used together with either a shield or a second weapon. On the other hand, very heavy weapons (compared to your strength) can only be wielded properly with two hands.

Wearing Gloves of the Giant will give you more blows with a two-handed weapon, though if your blows per round are maxed out in any case this bonus has no effect.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do skills (proficiency levels) work?

<color:R>A:</color> Weapon proficiency levels and dual wielding proficiency levels increase your to-hit bonus.  Spell proficiency levels decrease fail rate and mana consumption rate of spells.  Riding proficiency level gives you more speed when you are riding on a high speed monster, and decreases risk of falling from your mount.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I increase my proficiency level?

<color:R>A:</color> Proficiency level of a weapon will increase when you hit a monster whose level is high enough compared to your character level and to your current proficiency. Proficiency level of a spell will increase when you cast the spell at a dungeon level deep enough compared with the spell level. The needed conditions to increase riding proficiency are rather complex; generally, you need to hit a monster whose level is high enough compared with current riding proficiency level or to shoot a monster while riding on a high level mount.


<color:G>Q:</color> I'm a level 15 ranger and have been shooting everybody from the beginning, but my short bow proficiency is still Beginner (+0). Is something wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> Beginner (+0) doesn't sound great, but it's a lot better than Unskilled (-20), and is good enough you need to shoot monsters of native level 15 (or deeper) to get your proficiency up to +1.


<color:G>Q:</color> I'm a fighter type and rely largely on melee. Which weapon should I use?

<color:R>A:</color> In the very early game, you should usually use the weapon that does the most damage. Press Shift+C to see the character sheet, which displays your melee damage and melee to-hit. You should look at both to determine how good a weapon is - it's no use having a weapon that technically does lots of damage if you can't hit anything with it! Also remember, though, that your to-hit percentages will improve rapidly as your proficiency with a weapon increases. Don't worry too much about starting with an Unskilled proficiency - unless that's your proficiency cap for the weapon, or if the weapon is an icky wield.

As you start finding {excellent} weapons and artifacts, you may well want to wield a particular weapon for the resists, bonuses or abilities it provides, even if you have another weapon that would do more damage. A dead character has no use for a high damage output.


<color:G>Q:</color> What is an "Icky Wield"?

<color:R>A:</color> Some classes have a very strong preference for a certain weapon or type of weapon, to the extent that other weapons are marked as icky. The exact effects of wielding an icky weapon depend on class, but as a general rule you should always assume that an icky weapon will be worse than a non-icky one, at least from a melee perspective. In the specific case of Priests, however, the melee penalty is relatively small and the main drawback of an icky weapon is its effect on prayer fail rates.


<color:G>Q:</color> What exactly does the "Weapon Versatility" demigod talent do? Does it allow me to use icky weapons?

<color:R>A:</color> It allows you to reach Master proficiency with all weapons, including icky ones. However, the icky weapons will still be considered icky and incur the same icky-wield penalties.



<color:G>Q:</color> Some weapons have slays (like Slay Orc) or brands (like Viper's Fang). What do these mean?

<color:R>A:</color> Slays and brands do extra damage against the appropriate monsters (so Slay Orc does extra damage against orcs, and Viper's Fang does extra damage against monsters who don't resist poison). Slays and brands work by multiplying the weapon's dice (which makes them much more valuable on a 5d6 blade of chaos than on a 1d5 dagger).

If a weapon has multiple slays or brands that could apply to the same monster, only the strongest slay or brand (the highest multiplier) is applied; slays and brands never combine, with two exceptions. The first is Force (Mana Brand), which fully combines with other slays. The other is Mark of Chaos, which rolls a random slay or brand for each blow; if the weapon also has other slays or brands, the Mark of Chaos sometimes combines with them and makes them slightly stronger.


<color:G>Q:</color> I'm in a very dangerous spot, but there's a trap door right next to me. Is there any way I can deliberately fall through the trap door without making the automatic attempt to disarm it?

<color:R>A:</color> Use the '-' key, followed by the direction, to deliberately walk into the trap.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I ride on a monster?

<color:R>A:</color> At first, summon, charm or capture some suitable monster. Then use the pet menu command 'p'.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I use a Capture Ball?

<color:R>A:</color> Equip it and activate ('A') to a dying monster.


<color:G>Q:</color> I cannot hold a weapon and a shield without losing control of my horse.  My horse runs aimlessly!

<color:R>A:</color> You cannot directly control your mount unless you use one hand to control your mount.  But you can command your mount.  Just use 'p' command, and give your mount a target.  The horse which was given a target will no longer run around aimlessly.


<color:G>Q:</color> I have acquired a mutation! Is that bad?

<color:R>A:</color> Some mutations are good, while others are bad. Two towns - Zul and Anambar - offer a "cure mutation" service that allows you to get rid of bad mutations (the Zul service is much cheaper). Note, though, that you don't get to choose which mutation is removed - you might be "cured" of a good mutation, with the bad one staying in place...

Potions of New Life also cure mutations among their other effects, and potions of Polymorph both give and cure mutations at random.


<color:G>Q:</color> How important is Telepathy?

<color:R>A:</color> Full telepathy is extremely nice to have - it tells you about approaching threats, helps you locate fleeing or blinking enemies, and even allows you to spot monsters that might otherwise be invisible to you. However, it is still more of a convenience than something that you absolutely need, especially if you have easy and reliable access to Detection and have no or minimal problems seeing invisible creatures. A player without telepathy needs to detect monsters more often but can usually get by. Staves of Telepathy are also a handy option for players without permanent telepathy.


<color:G>Q:</color> What does Reflection do? How important is it?

<color:R>A:</color> It gives you a 75% chance of reflecting any incoming bolt or bolt-like attack. A reflected bolt will not damage you in any way, and may bounce back and damage the monster that fired it in the first place. Some monsters also have Reflection - in this case, they have a 75% chance of reflecting your bolt attacks, potentially back at you. If both you and the monster have Reflection, it's possible for a bolt to bounce between you two for a while... The main difference between monster reflection and player reflection is that monsters cannot reflect actual crossbow bolts (or arrows, sling ammo etc.) but you can reflect monster arrows.

Reflection is very helpful (and remains useful throughout the game) but is never really absolutely needed. Early on, it's particularly useful in the Camelot dungeon, which has many dangerous bolt casters.


<color:G>Q:</color> Some elements don't just deal damage, but also cause status effects like confusion or blindness. How much resistance do I need to be safe from status effects?

<color:R>A:</color> Most status effects compare your resistance to a 33-sided die (or a 55-sided die in the case of base elements). Accordingly, 30% confusion resistance gives you a 30 in 33 (about 91%) chance of resisting that status effect, and 40% confusion resistance will provide immunity.

In some very unusual cases your resistance may not be checked at all, or a special calculation may be used. (For example, a backfiring Invoke Spirits spell can completely bypass your confusion resistance.)


<color:G>Q:</color> Can I ever resist exotic attacks/elements like Water, Ice, Gravity, Rockets or Toxic Waste that aren't listed on my character sheet?

<color:R>A:</color> In most cases, you cannot resist the raw damage from such exotic elements. (There are a few exceptions - Toxic Waste can be resisted through poison resistance; Rockets have shard-based damage; and Bombs are combined sound and shards and can be resisted accordingly.)

However, many side-effects of exotic elements can be blocked or mitigated by resisting appropriate normal elements. For example, Shard resistance works against the cuts from Ice and Rocks, Sound resistance works against most elemental stunning effects as well as potion destruction from Water, and Cold resistance works against potion destruction from Ice.


<color:G>Q:</color> What do monsters' vampiric attacks do?

<color:R>A:</color> They drain life from you, thereby healing the monster, increasing its maximum HP and consuming your life points.


<color:G>Q:</color> Are Unlife attacks the same as vampiric attacks?

<color:R>A:</color> Unlife attacks are very similar to vampiric attacks, but instead of healing the monster or increasing its maximum HP they make the monster more powerful. A powerful monster has a higher AC, hits harder and casts more dangerous spells, but its maximum HP is not increased.


<color:G>Q:</color> What do the player's vampiric attacks do?

<color:R>A:</color> They drain life from the target monster; the monster will lose HP like on a normal attack, but in addition its max HP will be lowered slightly, and you will recover either a small amount of life points or a small amount of HP, should you need either. (If both your life points and hit points have fallen below the maximum, your life points will recover first.) Vampiric attacks are very useful and powerful; however, they only work on living monsters. Many strong monsters, like golems, vortices, demons, undead and the Serpent of Chaos, are immune to vampirism.


<color:G>Q:</color> What are "life points", anyway?

<color:R>A:</color> Life points determine your effective maximum HP. Normally, your effective max HP and displayed max HP will be identical; but if your life points fall below 100%, your effective max HP is lowered. Life points are only shown (e.g. "Life: <color:U>95%</color>") if they fall below the maximum; a loss of a few points shouldn't worry you too much, but a more significant drop can ruin your day.

Since life points only account for half of your max HP, your max HP will never hit zero; accordingly, it is possible to run out of life points without being killed outright. If this happens, you will be permanently transformed into an undead - either a skeleton, a vampire, a zombie, an einheri or a spectre - and regain full life points (or "unlife points") since the undead are immune to loss of life.


<color:G>Q:</color> My current HP is lower than my max HP - but it's still shown in green, not yellow, and it seems I can't heal any further. What's happening?

<color:R>A:</color> You've hit your effective maximum HP, which is lower than your displayed maximum HP because you've lost life points.


<color:G>Q:</color> How can I regain my lost life points?

<color:R>A:</color> Life points can be regained either through any type of vampiric attack, or by using a potion, device or activation. Potions of Restore Life Levels are a common way to regain life points, though they only restore up to 15 percentage points at a time. The Restoration service, available in most towns, also restores life points.


<color:G>Q:</color> I also have a "life rating", unrelated to my life points. Actually, I seem to have several life ratings! Just how is my max HP calculated?

<color:R>A:</color> Every character has a random "life rating" between 87% and 117%. This rating (the life rating proper) corresponds to the overall result of 49 randomly rolled HP gains (one for every character level after the first); the HP gains (and thus, your life rating) can be re-rolled during the game in several ways, most commonly by drinking a Potion of New Life. You are born with no knowledge of how good your life rating is, but drinking a Potion of Self Knowledge (or *Enlightenment*) will enlighten you. This is the only life rating you can affect in any way during play, and is the one displayed on your character sheet, if known.

The random life rating only accounts for about half of the HP you get per level; the other half is non-random. The non-random gains always total exactly 300 points, but how that total is distributed across the 49 level-ups depends on your class. In general, the distribution is very late-game-heavy on mage-type classes (who will struggle with HP for much of the early game as a result, even if they have a good life rating and high CON), while fighter classes like warriors get a more even distribution.

These two main contributions to your max HP are added together and multiplied by four non-random modifiers; the first three are the life rating multipliers of your race, your class and your personality. (These are prominently displayed at character generation, and new players are frequently confused by their relationship to the randomly generated life rating proper.) The fourth multiplier is based on your CON and any +Life or -Life items equipped.

Finally, after the multipliers, some lump sums are added (your class base HP, race base HP, and any HP from active buffs like heroism); and your effective maximum HP is adjusted to account for any reduction in your life points. It's a complicated system, but during the game you only need to worry about your random life rating and your CON!


<color:G>Q:</color> When should I reroll my life rating with a Potion of New Life?

<color:R>A:</color> In general, you should never reroll unless you know what your life rating is, or have a very good reason to suspect that it's atrociously low. The average life rating is 102% (not 100%), so that's the theoretical break-even point for a single Potion of New Life; but in practice, if you're already doing well, the risks of rolling a really bad life may outweigh the potential benefits of rolling a great one. So unless your life rating is really bad, it's worth having one or more backup potions in case the first New Life just makes things worse. The larger your backup pile, the further you can push the envelope - but there's always the risk of a long streak of unlucky lives...

Potions of New Life also remove all your mutations, and reroll all your internal stat caps. If you are very happy with either your mutations or your stat caps, that should make you more reluctant to drink a potion of New Life; though in general, your life rating is more important than your stat caps. Note that if you have already maxed out your stats, some of them are likely to be reduced by a Potion of New Life as new, potentially lower internal stat caps are applied.


<color:G>Q:</color> I drank a potion of New Life and my max HP went down, yet Self Knowledge says my life rating is higher than before! What gives?

<color:R>A:</color> Since your life rating is based on 49 random rolls, one for each character level, the life with the better end result at CL 50 is not necessarily better all the way through. Your old life might have had high rolls early on and lower rolls for the late levels, and your new life might be the opposite.

The other possible explanation is that you rolled a lower CON stat cap and your constitution went down as a result.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do internal stat caps (for STR, INT, WIS etc.) work?

<color:R>A:</color> They are randomly generated, no lower than 18/70 and no higher than 18/130; the average across the six stats is always 18/100, but it's much more fun to have high caps in your key stats and low caps in stats you don't really need than the opposite! The stat caps determine how high the stat can go before modifiers from race, class, personality, equipment, mutations etc. are applied.

The stat caps are much lower than the highest value a statistic can take after modifiers: 18/220, displayed as 18/***. By the endgame you will likely be getting large bonuses from your equipment; an extremely powerful character might even have all six stats maxed out at 18/220, regardless of the caps.


<color:G>Q:</color> There's a building in Morivant that offers artifact reforging. What does that mean? Is it something I should do?

<color:R>A:</color> For reforging, you need a source item - any artifact - and a destination item - any item that can be equipped and isn't already an artifact or ego item. (For rings and amulets this means an "empty" item, as all non-empty rings and amulets are considered ego items.) The original artifact will be destroyed, and the destination item is turned into a new artifact. The properties of the old artifact are not retained; however, if the destination item already had special properties despite being non-ego (e.g. resists on a dragon shield), those will be retained.

How powerful the new artifact will be depends mostly on the power of the source artifact. Usually it's going to be somewhat less powerful than the source, especially if the source artifact represented a "strong" slot (the strongest slots are the weapon slot and the body armor slot) while the target represented a weak slot (the weakest slots are lamps and amulets).

There are many reasons why reforging can be a good idea; for example, you may be unhappy with your item in a particular equipment slot, or you have an annoying resistance hole, or you have a very strong artifact that has a high score but for some reason isn't useful to you directly; or you're already wearing a non-ego item and want to upgrade it into an artifact. Ninjas (and Ninja-Lawyers) often reforge onto lamps, hoping to get an artifact lamp of darkness.


<color:G>Q:</color> What kind of source artifacts should I use for reforging? What kind of destination items should I use?

<color:R>A:</color> Stronger artifacts give better results, so use the strongest artifact you have that you can afford to reforge and that doesn't exceed your reforge power limit. (Of course, don't use a source artifact that's already useful to you, since the reforge will consume it!) If you're reforging onto a weaker slot, consider using a source artifact that's strong for its slot, rather than strong in absolute terms; this way, less power is lost to a slot downgrade. (For example, if you want a lamp, and you have artifact gloves with a 40K score and artifact armor with a 70K score, use the gloves; the two items will produce similar lamps, but the armor will produce a much better armor or weapon since none of its power is lost to a slot downgrade.)

If possible, use a destination item that's already good in some useful way - for example, dragon wings that already have resistances you'd like, or a diamond edge with sharpness and high base damage - but not one that's already good in some way you don't need, since that would be lost value. Don't use a destination item that's too powerful compared to the source item, since the reforge would be left without much room for improvements. (If you're fortunate enough to have a Scroll of Artifact Creation or a Scroll of Crafting, consider using one of those on the already-powerful item instead.)

Reforge from strong slots to strong slots, weak slots to weak slots, and - if necessary - strong slots to weak slots; but never reforge from a weak slot onto a strong slot.


<color:G>Q:</color> What determines my reforge power limit?

<color:R>A:</color> Your reforge power limit is determined by how famous you are. You gain fame by completing quests, turning in wanted monsters, killing enemies in the Thalos arena, and killing uniques (especially high-level uniques). You lose fame by failing quests or being defeated in an Arena fight. There is a soft reforge-power limit of 90000 or slot-adjusted equivalent - it is possible for a sufficiently famous player to use a source artifact that exceeds this limit, but the extra power will be ignored.


<color:G>Q:</color> When should I reforge?

<color:R>A:</color> Reforging is at its best relatively late in the game, when you've both found many very strong artifacts and accrued enough fame to use them as source items. Don't be afraid of trying it out earlier, though, especially if you need something specific like a dark lamp.


<color:G>Q:</color> What do Poison Needles do?

<color:R>A:</color> Poison needles are a special weapon. A poison needle only gets one hit per turn and usually only deals 1 damage on that hit; however, poison needle hits have a small chance of instantly killing any monster in the game, no matter how strong, unless it is a unique. Poison needles are often used to kill metal babbles, which are very difficult to kill through any other means. (The Metal Babble at the bottom of the Arena dungeon is technically a unique, but is still susceptible to a poison needle kill.)

Poison needles cannot be used in a reforge, and cannot be enchanted through any normal means. (Some classes, like Weaponsmiths, can use their special abilities to "enchant" a poison needle, but this has no actual effect on the needle's performance.) Poison needles have a 100% hit chance, unless the player is dual-wielding, in which case they have a 50% hit chance.


<color:G>Q:</color> Are Sexy Swimsuits just a useless joke item, or can they be actually good?

<color:R>A:</color> Sexy Swimsuits generate with special bonuses for characters with the Sexy personality, as well as Aphrodite demigods. In addition, wearing a Sexy Swimsuit makes Politicians' charming spells work better.

Other characters do not receive any special benefits from swimsuits, but may still want to hold onto them as reforge targets should they find any. Reforging a high-value artifact onto a Sexy Swimsuit can produce exceptionally good results because the aggravation on the swimsuit keeps its nominal value down.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I create a character dump?

<color:R>A:</color> If your character is still alive, press Shift+C for the character sheet, then press | to dump it. If you're dead, the tombstone screen offers easy character dumping - simply type the filename you want (usually something like "name.html" or "name_dead.html") and press Enter. If you died earlier and forgot to take a character dump, access the character sheet through the high score list (the '~' key, followed by the 'H' key) and then press '|' as before. If you're playing on the angband.live online server and have trouble dumping your character (users on some keyboard/browser combinations have experienced problems using the '|' key online), you can request help from your fellow players; the angband.live high score list is shared between all players, so anyone can use it to create a dump of your character.


<color:G>Q:</color> I want to post my character dump to the ladder on angband.oook.cz. Should I use a TXT dump or an HTML dump?

<color:R>A:</color> Use an HTML dump.


<color:G>Q:</color> What is the genesis of FrogComposband?

<color:R>A:</color> FrogComposband is a fork of ComPosband, a fork of PosChengband, which was based on Chengband, which was based on Hengband, which was based on Japanese ZAngband, which was based on regular ZAngband, a fork of Angband, which was based on Moria and Umoria. (Whew!)

In addition to these direct ancestors, FrogComposband and its "family" have been strongly influenced by a number of other Angband variants, like KAngband, Posband, ToME and OAngband. FrogComposband specifically has also inherited quite a bit of content - starting with its name - from Frogspawn, an unpublished fork of vanilla Angband.


<color:G>Q:</color> What is the design philosophy of FrogComposband?

<color:R>A:</color> Above all else, FrogComposband aims to be 1) fun and 2) challenging. (It also aims to sneakily bring about Armageddon and the ascendancy of hyperintelligent robots.)

The pursuit of a fun game involves quite a few things. The game tries to be fair to the player - unavoidable deaths out of nowhere should be unknown or at least extremely rare, and non-lethal attacks should add to the challenge and atmosphere but not spoil the fun. (Some unpopular effects can be turned off in the birth options.) Normal play should always keep the player on his toes, offering new situations to tackle and new decisions to make. FrogComposband also has much humorous content to lighten the mood, some of it hidden to be discovered when least expected.

You decide what's fun and what isn't! The game allows many different playstyles, from speed-diving to a slow, methodical grind, without trying to enforce any one of them on the player. It is also designed to be highly customizable, with about 100 options and a number of other ways to modify things. I don't try to make the decisions for you, beyond providing generally popular default settings; every player wants different things.

Winning the game should be an achievement! FrogComposband attempts to not be easy, but also to avoid artificial difficulty of the "screw you, you're dead" type; a player who makes no mistakes and knows what he's doing should always have a good chance to win. The game also aims to be balanced; while some classes, races, items and spell realms are much stronger than others, none should be so strong as to make the game unchallenging or uninteresting.

The game should be infinitely replayable; different personalities, races and (especially) classes present very different challenges, and even two characters of the same race, class and personality can play very differently based on the decisions made, items found and monsters encountered.

The game is constantly evolving (and hopefully improving); it does not claim to have fully reached any of its aims yet, but it's trying to get closer and closer. Player feedback helps there!


<color:G>Q:</color> Who wrote Hengband?

<color:R>A:</color> Hengband is mainly based on ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version. ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version was developed by Mitsuhiro Itakura, based on both ZAngband 2.2.8 and Angband 2.8.3 Japanese version, and has some original features, for example, Auto-picker, in addition to simple translation.

Hengband also includes codes from many other variants including ToME, OAngband, etc.  Mr.Hoge wrote the first original part of Hengband.  And currently, it is maintained by Hengband Development Team including Mr.Hoge, Habu, Henkma, iks, Kuwa, Mogami and nsk.


<color:G>Q:</color> So is that why there is so much Japanese content in this game?

<color:R>A:</color> Yes, though it doesn't hurt that Japanese popular culture has many followers worldwide.


<color:G>Q:</color> Is there a more detailed help file?
