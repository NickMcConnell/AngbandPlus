<style:title>FrogComposband FAQ</style>

<color:G>Q:</color> I'd like to move one square at a time, but every time I press a key my character moves halfway across the screen. Help!

<color:R>A:</color> You are somehow triggering the Run command instead of the Walk command. In addition to normal running (with the '.' command), FrogComposband uses preference files to support shiftrunning (running by using the Shift key), which is preferred by some players. This mechanic sometimes leads to unwanted running, especially on the angband.live online server which has some very odd default settings. If you are playing there, see if toggling Num Lock helps you stop running, or else request help in the server chat.


<color:G>Q:</color> All right, I have a character up and walking. What should I do?

<color:R>A:</color> First of all, you will want things that help your character survive difficult situations - either cheap healing potions (cure light/cure serious wounds), or escape scrolls (phase door/teleportation), or ideally both. These are sold at the Temple (shop <color:g>4</color>) and the Alchemy Shop (shop <color:b>5</color>). After that, you'll probably want to either explore a dungeon (Warrens, in Outpost, is the easiest and the usual starter dungeon) or request and complete one of the early quests. While the Thieves' Hideout quest is marked as level 5, for all but the weakest characters it is doable at the very beginning of the game, at least with a bit of luck and a cure wounds potion or two.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I access the Thieves' Hideout quest?

<color:R>A:</color> In Outpost, walk to the large building just outside the city walls and press 'q' to request a quest from the Count. Then walk to the building in the northeast of the city and press '>' at the quest entrance.


<color:G>Q:</color> I keep dying! What am I doing wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> Don't worry - this is an expected part of the development curve for new players, and even experienced roguelike veterans die a lot (with the possible exception of the player nicknamed "clouded"!) Learn from your mistakes - if a situation got you killed, avoid getting in that situation again, or make sure you have the supplies to keep you alive if something similar does happen again. Do not rely too much on items with a fail rate - the game is long, and if you take too many chances you will fail at the wrong time eventually. Try to avoid situations where you are one fail away from death.
   
At the same time, it is much better to have an item that saves you 97% of the time than to not have that item! In particular, Staffs of Teleport are a key helper that will often get you out of a tough spot; unlike scrolls of teleportation, staffs can be used while confused, which is often critical in the early midgame before the player acquires resistance to confusion.

Learn to know the monsters, develop strategies appropriate to their strengths and weaknesses, and avoid fights with enemies too strong for you.


<color:G>Q:</color> I want to play with the strongest possible race/class combination. Which one is that?

<color:R>A:</color> It's hard to say what the strongest class is, both because there are so many (with different strengths and approaches) and because some classes (like berserkers) are strong in the early game and not so strong later, while others (like psions, an extremely powerful endgame class) have the opposite curve. Ninjas are often used as an example of a strong class, and while it's very debatable whether they are the strongest, they do have the advantage of steady development that keeps them powerful through all phases of the game.

Demigods and Amberites are two of the most powerful races, but they also have a very steep leveling-up penalty, which can be a significant drawback if you want to go places fast. The "plain" human is actually a surprisingly powerful pick, since humans level up very fast but still get two demigod powers at levels 20 and 40.

At the opposite end, yeek tourists and snotling tourists are extremely weak combinations, used by players looking for the ultimate challenge.


<color:G>Q:</color> The game is offering me a stat-up. What should I invest in?

<color:R>A:</color> Choose a statistic your character needs; for example, on a melee character you'll want to improve either your strength or dexterity first, and constitution will also help you. If the base for one of your key stats is exactly 18, you'll probably want to improve that stat, because improvements get larger and more significant above 18. Do not invest too much in any one stat, though; the improvements become much smaller again as a statistic approaches its cap level.


<color:G>Q:</color> The game is offering me a demigod power. Which one should I pick?

<color:R>A:</color> It depends on what your character needs; take your time to read the descriptions of all the powers to see which one suits you best. Generally, though, Unyielding and Fleet of Foot are both very strong options and are good "default" picks if you don't feel comfortable selecting something more exotic.


<color:G>Q:</color> I have found lots of cool items, but the monsters I meet keep destroying them! Am I doing something wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> Elemental resists help protect your inventory. With one level of resistance, the chances of an item being destroyed by that element are significantly reduced; with two levels of resistance, the item will only be destroyed if you're really unlucky; with three levels of resistance the item will be safe. Watch out for fire, acid, cold and electricity in the early game, and also chaos in the late game.

If you don't have the appropriate resist and don't want to risk losing the item, avoid monsters that might destroy it; or, if they only destroy items in melee, avoid melee and kill them with ranged attacks.

Note that the armor you wear will always be susceptible to damage from acid attacks - regardless of your acid resistance level - unless you have immunity to acid. This can be really annoying in the early game; by the late game you'll mostly wear artifacts or excellent items that cannot be harmed by acid.


<color:G>Q:</color> I got bored in Outpost so I headed into the wilderness... and I'm still there searching endlessly down one road after another looking for a town.  Where are other towns and dungeons?

<color:R>A:</color> You need to use the global wilderness map (press the < key on the ground level).  This gives you a scaled map of the world (often called the "overworld map"), where you can travel to other towns and dungeons more easily.  It is possible to reach any location in the game without using the overworld map (most roads do lead somewhere); but such an approach will take you much longer and also entail more risk, since monsters won't attack you as often if you travel through the overworld map.


<color:G>Q:</color> I cannot access the overworld map. What's wrong?

<color:R>A:</color> You are either playing in no-wilderness mode, which has no overworld map, or there is a monster nearby and the game won't let you escape too easily by entering the overworld. Selecting 'Beginner' (instead of 'Normal') at character creation forces no-wilderness mode, which sometimes confuses players who've seen or heard about the game and expect a wilderness.


<color:G>Q:</color> I want to play as an Android, Balrog, Golem, Skeleton, Zombie, Spectre, or Ent.  But I can't find any scrolls of satisfy hunger. And Berserkers no longer have racial ability of satisfy hunger. How do I avoid starvation?

<color:R>A:</color> Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger and the Berserker ability of Satisfy Hunger are obsoleted, and races which previously relied on Satisfy Hunger have new sources of nutrition now. Androids can quaff oil.  Balrogs can sacrifice human corpses using the 'E'at command.  Golems, Skeletons, Zombies, and Spectres can absorb mana from staves and wands using the 'E'at command.  Ents can gain enough nutrition from potions.


<color:G>Q:</color> I'm playing as a berserker, and cannot read scrolls.  How do I remove a curse?

<color:R>A:</color> You can simply 't'ake off the cursed equipment.  Since cursed items will attempt to stick, you may need to try the 't'ake off command more than once.


<color:G>Q:</color> I know Berserkers cannot use scrolls, and rods.  How do I recall from dungeon?  Maybe I need to travel completely on foot!?

<color:R>A:</color> Berserkers gain the class power 'Recall' at level 10.  Press 'U' (original keyset) or 'O' (Roguelike keyset) to use class powers.


<color:G>Q:</color> Why do Ninjas start the game with Iron Spikes?

<color:R>A:</color> Ninjas (and Ninja-Lawyers) can use Iron Spikes as shuriken; use the 'v' command to throw a spike. (Other classes can also use spikes as throwing weapons, but will only do marginal damage; they are much more useful for a ninja.)


<color:G>Q:</color> I'm at normal speed (+0). But normal speed monsters sometimes double-move me!

<color:R>A:</color> In FrogComposband, the amount of energy needed for a move is somewhat randomized (though less so than in its predecessor PosChengband). This method of speed system is an important feature of FrogComposband and simulates real fighting. Usually a monster with the same speed as you will only get one move in, but always prepare for the possibility that they might get two moves! Don't fight when your HP is low unless you have a death wish.

Also, monsters don't always move at their listed speed; watch out for hasted monsters.


<color:G>Q:</color> I tried to dual wield two weapons.  But I couldn't hit anything!

<color:R>A:</color> You need to practice your dual wielding skill (proficiency level) and your weapon skills.  Hitting high level monsters many times will improve your skills.  Note that the information command '~' reveals your proficiency levels.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do skills (proficiency levels) work?

<color:R>A:</color> Weapon proficiency levels and dual wielding proficiency levels increase your to-hit bonus.  Spell proficiency levels decrease fail rate and mana consumption rate of spells.  Riding proficiency level gives you more speed when you are riding on a high speed monster, and decreases risk of falling from your mount.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I increase my proficiency level?

<color:R>A:</color> Proficiency level of a weapon will increase when you hit a monster whose level is high enough compared with your character level. Proficiency level of a spell will increase when you cast the spell at a dungeon level deep enough compared with the spell level. The needed conditions to increase riding proficiency are rather complex; generally, you need to hit a monster whose level is high enough compared with current riding proficiency level or to shoot a monster while riding on a high level mount.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I ride on a monster?

<color:R>A:</color> At first, summon, charm or capture some suitable monster. Then use the pet menu command 'p'.


<color:G>Q:</color> How do I use a Capture Ball?

<color:R>A:</color> Just equip it and activate 'A' to a dying monster.


<color:G>Q:</color> I cannot hold a weapon and a shield without losing control of my horse.  My horse runs aimlessly!

<color:R>A:</color> You cannot directly control your mount unless you use one hand to control your mount.  But you can command your mount.  Just use 'p' command, and give your mount a target.  The horse which was given a target will no longer run around aimlessly.


<color:G>Q:</color> What is the genesis of FrogComposband?

<color:R>A:</color> FrogComposband is a fork of ComPosband, a fork of PosChengband, which was based on Chengband, which was based on Hengband, which was based on Japanese ZAngband, which was based on regular ZAngband, a fork of Angband, which was based on Moria and Umoria. (Whew!) In addition to these direct ancestors, FrogComposband and its "family" have been strongly influenced by a number of other Angband variants, like KAngband, Posband, ToME and OAngband.
   

<color:G>Q:</color> Who wrote Hengband?

<color:R>A:</color> Hengband is mainly based on ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version. ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version was developed by Mitsuhiro Itakura, based on both ZAngband 2.2.8 and Angband 2.8.3 Japanese version, and has some original features, for example, Auto-picker, in addition to simple translation.

Hengband also includes codes from many other variants including ToME, OAngband, etc.  Mr.Hoge wrote the first original part of Hengband.  And currently, it is maintained by Hengband Development Team including Mr.Hoge, Habu, Henkma, iks, Kuwa, Mogami and nsk.


<color:G>Q:</color> So is that why there is so much Japanese content in this game?

<color:R>A:</color> Yes, though it doesn't hurt that Japanese popular culture has many followers worldwide.


<color:G>Q:</color> Is there a more detailed help file?
