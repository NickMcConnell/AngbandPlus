#####GVarda Elentari's Magic
Worshipping Varda Elentari gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Varda. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Varda will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for her help without offending her! 

There is a special book - called the "Shining Tome of Varda" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Varda will 
grant. There are four prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BLight of Valinor] (Level 1)
   Lights up a room.
   At spell level 3 it starts damaging monsters.
   At spell level 15 it starts creating a more powerful kind of light.
2. [[[[[BCall of Almaren] (Level 10)
   Banishes evil beings.
   At spell level 20 it dispels evil beings.
3. [[[[[BEvenstar] (Level 30)
   Maps and lights the whole level.
   At spell level 40 it maps and lights the whole level, in addition to 
   letting you know yourself better and identifying your whole pack.
4. [[[[[BStar Kindler] (Level 35)
   Does multiple bursts of light damage. The power increases with level.
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, Varda will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_mana.txt*0[Mana School] at 1/4 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_meta.txt*0[Meta School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
