<style:title>General Information</style>

This document gives a brief introduction to the game. FrogComposband is a single-player dungeon simulation; you play a character whose ultimate aim is to slay the dreaded <color:keyword>Serpent of Chaos</color>, who lurks somewhere in the dark depths of the dungeon. Along the way, you will complete many side missions, learn mighty magical spells, defeat or befriend fantastic monsters, acquire wonderful treasures, navigate dark labyrinths, navigate long sentences, get baffled by obscure references to foreign popular culture, bang the desk in frustration many times as things go wrong, and hopefully end up enjoying yourself a lot.

<topic:Help><style:heading>About the Help Files</style>

You have probably seen many games that come with a 300-page manual the authors expect you to read before you start to play. FrogComposband is like that, except its manual is not as pocket-sized.

Of course you do not really have to read the whole thing before you play; you can just jump in, figure things out through play, and look up the more mystifying stuff in the help as it becomes relevant. Read enough that you know what you are expected to do in this game and how to go about doing it. This file is definitely worth reading, as is the <color:keyword>commands help file</color> (<link:command.txt>); you cannot really do anything in the game without knowing the commands. The <color:keyword>Newbie Guide</color> (<link:tang.txt>) you can either treat as a quick reference to most of the basics, or ignore completely and never open. The <color:keyword>Frequently Asked Questions</color> (<link:faq.txt>) you can initially skip, at least apart from the early part, and return to once you have the commands and other basics figured out; much of the documentation concentrates on the basics (in varying levels of detail), while the FAQ is a good place to find quick coverage of more advanced topics.

Throughout the help, some concepts are <color:keyword>highlighted in red</color>, occasionally <color:G>green</color> or <color:y>yellow</color>, to create the illusion they are important and to make the pages look a bit less dreary. A green letter in <color:G>[square brackets]</color> is a link to another part of the documentation that can be followed by pressing the letter. You can also press <color:keypress>?</color> for help on the help itself.

<topic:Basics><style:heading>The Basics of the Game</style>

Before the game can begin, you must create a character. You may choose from a large number of races, classes, personalities, magic realms and birth options (see <link:birth_contents.txt>), but your ultimate goal is always the same: defeat the evil Serpent of Chaos. Whether you do this to rid the world of evil, or just to become its next overlord, is entirely up to you...

You guide your character through simple key commands as you explore the world, discover useful items, and fight monsters with steel and magic. Killing the Serpent is a very long-term goal; a single game may take days, weeks, or even months. To get ready for that final encounter, you must gain much <color:G>experience</color> from your adventures, and find ever more valuable magical <color:G>equipment</color> to protect you and enhance your powers.

The game comes with a vast <color:keyword>wilderness</color> featuring many towns and numerous dungeons to explore. Most dungeons have a boss guarding the bottom level; killing the boss often gives you a nice reward. Each dungeon also has a theme; for example, the <color:keyword>Orc Caves</color> are infested with... you guessed it: orcs! But the theme might be something else entirely, such as the <color:keyword>Anti-Melee Cave</color> where melee is prohibited, or the <color:keyword>Arena</color> where each monster is isolated and you can (usually) fight them one-on-one. There is much to explore; but in case you want a simpler game, this wilderness is optional.

<topic:Modes><style:heading>Play Modes</color>

There are several different modes of play. <color:keyword>Beginner Mode</color> limits the number of races and classes available, removes personality selection, assigns birth options automatically and turns off the wilderness; this mode is designed to simplify the birth process so you can get to actual play as soon as possible.

Some players skip Beginner Mode and jump straight to <color:keyword>Normal Mode</color>, the usual and expected way to play. Normal Mode has a wilderness by default (though you may still turn it off), and also offers the full repertoire of race, class and personality choices. Prepare to be overwhelmed!

Finally, if you tire of dying to myriad powerful monsters, you can play as a monster yourself in <color:keyword>Monster Mode</color>; here you pick one of many types of monsters to play, start as a weak monster of that type, and evolve into more powerful forms as you gain experience. Equipment management can be very different in Monster Mode; many monsters have unique body types, and some rely purely on their innate attacks (claws, teeth, acidic pseudopods and the like) and cannot wield conventional weapons. There is no class selection in Monster Mode; the type of monster you select is effectively both your race and your class.

<color:keyword>Coffee-break mode</color> is an accelerated, faster-paced version of the game, with no wilderness, no level repetitions, smaller levels in the early game, increased monster item drops and faster leveling-up. <color:G>Selecting Beginner Mode automatically activates coffee-break play</color>, but the mode is also available as a birth option for Normal Mode and Monster Mode, and is not intended exclusively for new players. The "no wilderness" option is balanced around coffee-break mode, and turning off both coffee-break mode and the wilderness is not recommended.

<topic:First><style:heading>First Things to Do</style>

You begin your adventure in the town of <color:keyword>Outpost</color>, where you may acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop owners. You will have some gear as a birthright, and a little bit of gold as well.

First of all, you should visit the shops and buy some key supplies - Scrolls of Phase Door and Teleportation from the <color:keyword>Alchemy Shop</color> and Potions of Cure Serious Wounds from the <color:keyword>Temple Shop</color>. It is very easy to get in over your head, especially early on, so having ready ways to escape and heal is essential. If you have gold left over, consider upgrading your starting torch to a lantern at the <color:keyword>General Store</color>; a lantern casts more light, and so allows you to see further in the dark.

You are now ready to descend into the dungeon, where fantastic adventures await you... but hold on a moment! If you visit the castle of Uldrik, the ruler of Outpost, you will receive a special <color:keyword>town quest</color> you might want to complete first.

See <link:town.txt> for more on the town and its shops, and <link:town.txt#TownQuests> for a detailed explanation of town quests.

<topic:Dungeon><style:heading>Into the Dungeon</style>

<style:note>Note: The parts of this help that cover no-wilderness play assume that coffee-break mode is active. If you selected Beginner Mode, this is automatically the case.</style>

If you are playing with the wilderness on, the first dungeon to explore is <color:keyword>Warrens</color>, a small dungeon whose entrance is located next to your starting position in Outpost. Like many of the dungeons, this one has a boss: some king or lord of the kobolds. He is reasonably tough for his level, but this is mostly due to his vast host readied about him; keep your wits about you and avoid fighting his whole army in one go, and you should be fine. If you already completed Uldrik's first town quest and requested another, you will also find the <color:y>Pest Control</color> quest in Warrens; completing this quest is an excellent way to ready yourself for the kobold lord. See <link:dungeon_contents.txt> for more on what to expect in a dungeon.

If you are playing with the wilderness off, the choice of dungeon at least is very easy: there is only one, <color:keyword>Angband</color>. The choice of direction within the dungeon is also easy: you can only go deeper! Pretty soon (with the same caveats as in wilderness play!) you will find the <color:y>Pest Control</color> dungeon quest, an early make-or-break moment for your budding character. You will also meet random <color:keyword>level guardians</color> once in a while; do your best to kill them, as they drop valuable items. Once you feel you have done enough dungeon adventuring, read a Scroll of <color:keyword>Word of Recall</color> to return to Outpost.

<topic:Wilderness><style:heading>Wilderness</style>

Your adventures take place in a large and dangerous wilderness. Fortunately, you begin your journey in the relative safety of the town of Outpost; but beware, even inside the town walls the wilderness is not far off, and dangerous monsters can wander in.

Once you have conquered the starter dungeon <color:keyword>Warrens</color> (and possibly also <color:keyword>Hideout</color>, another early dungeon accessed from Outpost), you should be ready to set out into the wild. You will need ample supplies of light and food; but even more important is <color:keyword>teleportation</color>, as the wilderness is a dangerous place.

If your intent is to journey to another town, or to locate a dungeon entrance, you should use the special <color:keyword>global wilderness map</color> (sometimes known as the "overworld map") for your travels. Entering and leaving this special map uses the same keys as stair climbing:

<style:note>Press <color:keypress><</color> to enter the global map, and <color:keypress>></color> to leave it.</style>

Watch out, though: you cannot enter the global map if alert foes are nearby. Also, you can be <color:keyword>ambushed</color> even on the global map; this is more likely at night and away from the relative safety of the well-traveled roads. Ambushes can be very deadly if you do not have some means of teleportation to escape with.

On the overworld map, you may look about with the <color:keypress>*</color> command to inspect towns and dungeon entrances. Pay attention to the danger level of the various dungeons and wilderness tiles; this is displayed on the top row as you use look around, and indicates safe (or dangerous) areas of travel. For dungeons, the shallowest depth is indicated.

Many towns and dungeons await you; good dungeons to explore early on include the <color:keyword>Orc Caves</color>, the <color:keyword>Tidal Cave</color>, the <color:keyword>Icky Cave</color> and the <color:keyword>Labyrinth</color>. You should also visit the towns of <color:keyword>Morivant</color>, <color:keyword>Anambar</color> and <color:keyword>Thalos</color> quite early - though going to Thalos on foot is not recommended... To the northeast of the town of Morivant, near the center of the map, is the dread dungeon of <color:keyword>Angband<color:normal>. It is home to the Serpent of Chaos, whom you must kill in order to win the game.

Surface
</style>
From time to time, I will include screenshots in the documentation to help explain things. In the picture above, the player (me, represented as @) has entered the global map by pressing <color:keypress><</color> and then walked from Outpost (the southwestern *) to the town of Morivant, which he is currently standing next to. Dungeon entrances are marked as <$:FF_ENTRANCE>, and the entrance to Angband is highlighted as <color:y>></color>.

As you can see, it will take a while to run out of dungeons to explore (and only a small part of the whole map is shown here!); but some of these dungeons are much deadlier than others. <color:keyword>Dragon's Lair</color>, for example, starts at depth 60 and runs to depth 72. There is no one right order to visit the dungeons in, though most players do like to start with the easy ones...

Many of the most dangerous dungeons have <color:keyword>entrance guardians</color>, high-level monsters who try to keep you from even entering the cave. The entrance to <color:keyword>Crystal Castle</color>, for example, is guarded by a very nasty Ethereal dragon. Most entrance guardians tend not to move much, preferring to remain as close to the entrance as possible.

A final note on the wilderness: to penetrate the mountains, you will need a source of <color:keyword>levitation</color>. Several of the dungeon entrances are buried in the mountains, so you won't be able to reach them otherwise - and as for the deep waters of the oceans, best to stay away altogether.

See <link:town.txt#Wilderness> for a more detailed account of the wilderness and its dungeons.

<topic:Winning><style:heading>Winning The Game</style>

OK, we are getting a little ahead of ourselves here, but by now, you surely have defeated <color:keyword>Oberon</color>, right? Perhaps not, but eventually you will be powerful enough to face the King of the Amberites on level 99 (4950') in the dungeon of <color:keyword>Angband</color>. Defeat this foe and a magical staircase will appear that will finally allow you to reach level 100 and face the dreaded <color:keyword>Serpent of Chaos</color>. You will not be able to go below his level until you have killed him. Try to avoid wandering around on level 100 unless you are ready for him, since the Serpent has a habit of coming at you across the dungeon, to slay you for your impudence...

In no-wilderness play, these final fights differ from the other Angband quests in that you can flee and recall to town if you find you were not adequately prepared. Wilderness play allows this in the random quests as well (see <link:dungeon.txt#RandomQuests>).

The Serpent of Chaos is a very difficult foe and you will need to garner all of your resources in order to stand a decent chance of success. This typically means lots and lots (and lots more besides that) of <color:B>Healing</color> and <color:B>*Healing*</color>. And you will need plenty of destruction besides to deal with his summons. I won't give any more hints than that, since figuring out how to win is part of the fun, right?

If you should actually succeed in your attempt to kill the Serpent of Chaos, you will receive the status of <color:keyword>WINNER</color>. You can continue to explore, and may even save the game and play more later, but since you have defeated the toughest creature alive, there is really not much point. Unless you wish to listen to the rumors of a powerful ring buried somewhere in the dungeon. And then some monsters have been rumored to come back from the dead!

When you are ready to retire, simply "commit suicide" (<color:keypress>^K</color>) to end the game (don't forget to take a final character dump for posterity). Note that until you retire, you can still be killed, so you may want to retire before wandering into a hoard of Cyberdemons...

<topic:UponDeath><style:heading>Upon Death and Dying</style>

Hit points (<color:keyword>HP</color>) track the health of your character. If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died and the adventure is over; you can say a few last words before the dreaded tombstone screen appears. Your character will be added to the Hall of Fame, and you can still access your character sheet (with all items mysteriously identified) through either the Hall of Fame or the tombstone screen.

Whether your character is killed or retires victorious, it will leave behind a reduced save file, which contains your option choices, monster knowledge and object knowledge (see <link:monster.txt#MonsterMemory>) and selections at birth. If this savefile is restored, a new character is generated exactly as if the file was not there, but the old character's monster and object knowledge are inherited by the new one. You also gain the extra option of a <color:keyword>quick start</color>, which allows you to easily start a new character of the same race, class and personality.

Don't get discouraged! Dying is very common and makes victory, when it comes at long last, all the more sweet. It may take months to win the game, perhaps even years. But there is fun in the journey, and much to try along the way. <color:G>Good luck, and enjoy!</color>
