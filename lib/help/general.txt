<style:title>General Information</style>

This document gives a brief introduction to the game. You will probably want to browse through all the help files, especially the sections on available commands (see <link:commdesc.txt> and <link:command.txt>), before beginning any serious adventuring. There is also a Newbie guide (see <link:tang.txt>) and I'll leave it you to decide if that is the best place to start reading. (Aside: Whenever you see a letter in <color:link>square brackets</color>, that is a link to another place in the documentation. Press that letter to follow the link, and escape to return back to where you were in this document. Go ahead and try it now! You can also press <color:keypress>?</color> for help on the help system itself.)

The game is a single player dungeon simulation. A player may choose from a number of races, classes and magic realms when creating a character (see <link:birth_contents.txt>), and then "run" that character over a period of days, weeks, even months. Deep down inside, the real objective of the game is to increase your experience, and certain other characteristics, and also to collect useful items, to give you a decent chance of defeating the final monster. Depending upon which world sequence you are playing, this is either <color:keyword>Morgoth, Lord of Darkness</color> or <color:keyword>The Serpent of Chaos</color>.

Eventually, the game will support multiple "modules" and the player will select which module to play during the birth sequence. The <color:keyword>Middle Earth</color> module is currently the only one, but a <color:keyword>World of Amber</color> will probably arrive soon. Each module defines a sequence of worlds for the player to explore. Each world has a surface wilderness with one or more towns as well as multiple dungeons. Each dungeon has one or more guardians: sometimes there is an initial guardian on the first level but there is always a guardian on the final level. One of these final guardians is also the "world guardian": defeat it an you either move on to the next world, or you win the game! For example, in Middle Earth, the first world is <color:keyword>The Desolation of Smaug</color>, and you must kill this dragon before moving on to the next world (<color:keyword>The Betrayal of Sarmuan</color>).

The game also offers a few different ways to play. First, there is a <color:keyword>Beginner Mode</color> that limits the number of races and classes available. Playing in beginner mode is designed to simplify the birth process and get you playing as soon as possible so that you may more quickly learn the game. Eventually, you will want to upgrade to <color:keyword>Normal Mode</color>, the usual and expected way to play. This mode offers the full repertoire of racial and class choices. Prepare to be overwhelmed! Also, as you read the help files, you will find that most of the documentation is written for this mode. Finally, you may decide you are tired of playing the game as a normal player, constantly dying to myriad powerful monsters, and decide to play as a monster yourself in <color:keyword>Monster Mode</color>. With this style, you can pick one of many types of monsters to play and will evolve into more powerful forms as you gain experience. Many monsters have unique body types so the equipment game will prove interesting. Most also have some forms of innate attacks and may not be able to wield weapons at all (e.g. Dragons can claw and bite, but it would be funny to see one wielding a sword). Truly, there is much to try!

<topic:First><style:heading>First Place to Go</style>

The player will begin his adventure in town where he may acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop owners. You will have some gear as a birthright, and a little bit of gold as well. I recommend buying some scrolls of teleport and potions of cure light wounds (or serious wounds if you are rich) before beginning to play. It is very easy to get in over your head, especially early on, so having a ready means of escape is essential. If you have gold left over, consider upgrading your starting torch to a lantern, which casts more light and allows you to see further in the dark.

You are now ready to descend into the dungeon where fantastic adventures await! The first dungeon to explore is <color:keyword>The Stronghold</color>, a small dungeon whose entrance is located near the starting town. Use the <color:keypress>]</color> or the <color:keypress>M</color> commands to locate the entrance. Like many of the dungeons, this one has a boss: some king or other of the Southerings. He's reasonably tough for his level, but this is mostly due to his vast host readied about him. He has many more friends at the ready as well, so you won't want to face him in the open.

<color:B>Update: </color>As you are exploring this dungeon, you might wonder something: How do I get back to the surface? Well, you can walk back up stairs of course, but this will eventually become tiresome. Fortunately, you will begin finding <color:keyword>Wizard Tiles</color> on many (but not all) dungeon levels, starting at about 200' (DL4). These tiles are located in special rooms, often under some sort of monster guard, and unless you are wizard yourself, they are your only means of recalling back to the surface (There are no longer Word of Recall scrolls, but a few magic realms offer the spell). Some towns will have a Wizard Tile for free travel back to the depths, but most will offer a town service and charge you a fee.

Once you have completed The Stronghold, you should be ready to set out into the wild, the subject of the next section.

<topic:Wilderness><style:heading>Wilderness</style>

Your adventures take place in a dangerous wilderness. Fortunately, you begin your journey in the relative safety of the town. But beware, even inside the town walls the wilderness is not far off. Dangerous monsters do occasionally wander into the town!

When you are ready to begin exploring the wilderness, you will need ample supplies of light and food. 

<color:B>Update: </color>The game no longer has a special wilderness travel mode, so wilderness exploration is just like dungeon exploration. Also, the wilderness map is no longer revealed to the player, but must be learned through actual exploration (Eventually, some sort of random wilderness generator will be available as a birth option). Fortunately, there are usually roads available leading out of town, and you can travel along those to locate additional towns or dungeon entrances. As a tip, using the run command will keep the player on the road if you do it right: Starting on a "road tile" initiate running in the direction of the next road tile, and you will travel quickly and automatically, stopping only under monster assault or ambiguity in the road tile sequence (which sometimes happens at bends in the road). For example, <color:keypress>SHIFT+6</color> will follow the (yellow-brick) road out of town in this scenario:
<screenshot:general01>

As you travel, you may "stumble on to something interesting," which indicates a dungeon entrance. Use the <color:keypress>M</color> command to locate the entrance (You can also travel to the stairs with <color:keypress>]</color> followed by <color:keypress>`</color> once you select the stairs). Some entrances will require <color:keyword>Levitation</color> to reach, especially in mountainous terrain, so you might wish to acquire this ability before setting out on your journeys (Visit <color:keyword>The Magic Shop</color>).

Each dungeon in the wilderness has a starting level which is shown to you when prompted if you really wish to enter. Think of this as a difficulty level, and indeed, many of the dungeons are quite difficult if you wander into them unprepared, so be careful!

<topic:Winning><style:heading>Winning The Game</style>

<color:B>Update: </color>The <color:keyword>Middle Earth</color> module consists of a sequence of worlds, each of which contains a specific monster to kill. The first world is <color:keyword>The Desolation of Smaug</color> and you must eventually journey to <color:keyword>The Lonely Mountain</color> to defeat this foe. Upon success, a special <color:keyword>Travel Portal</color> will be generated allowing you to journey to the next world to continue your quest (Tip: You don't need to take the Travel Portal right away. You can always return to the sight of your triumph later on. Also, the contents of your <color:keyword>Home</color> will follow you to the next world). Eventually, if you defeat <color:keyword>Morgoth, Lord of Darkness</color> in <color:keyword>The Depths of Mordor</color> you will win the game, but that is a long ways off so don't expect to win right away. You will need to learn how to play well in order to succeed, and this may take many deaths to achieve. So set your sights lower and focus on having fun instead!

<color:B>Update: </color>As of this writing, the Middle Earth module is the only available option, so you aren't even prompted during your character's birth. I do plan a <color:keyword>World of Amber</color> module that will have <color:keyword>The Serpent of Chaos</color> as the "win monster." Stay tuned!

<topic:UponDeath><style:heading>Upon Death and Dying</style>

If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died and cannot be restored. You can write a last word for posting on the Internet after which time, a tombstone showing information about your character will be displayed. You are also permitted to get a record of your character, and all your equipment (identified) either on the screen or in a file.

<color:B>Update: </color>The game now automatically keeps a character dump for each of your players. You can view your own personal high score ladder using the <color:keypress>~H</color> command.

Whether your character is killed or you retire victorious, it will leave behind a reduced save file, which contains any <color:keyword>Lore</color> your player has learned, such as information about various monsters and objects. Personally, I prefer to reset my Lore information for every game, so I never re-use existing savefiles.

And don't get discouraged! Dying is very common and makes victory, when it comes at long last, all the more sweet. It may take months to win the game, perhaps even years. But there is fun in the journey, and much to try along the way. <color:keyword>Enjoy!</color>
