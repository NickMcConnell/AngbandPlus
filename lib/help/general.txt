#####R=== General Information ===

The game of PernAngband is a single player dungeon simulation.  A player
may choose from a number of races and classes when creating a character,
and then "run" that character over a period of days, weeks, even months,
attempting to win the game by defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in 
the depths of the dungeon.

The player will begin his adventure on the town level where he may acquire
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop
owners.  After preparing for his adventure, the player can descend into the
dungeon near Bree where fantastic adventures await his coming!
 
You will probably need to browse through the "help files", especially the
one on available commands, before beginning any serious adventuring...

#####R=== Differences Between PernAngband and Vanilla Angband ===

The first main difference a new player to PernAngband will need to be aware of
is that the main dungeon from Angband has been split into 4 "dungeons", each 
of which cover a different portion of the dungeon's levels. Each of these 4 
dungeons are located either in or near one of the four main towns so that the 
character can keep stocked up on supplies. As the adventurer advances in 
ability, they will need to travel overland to the next town/dungeon, which is 
most easily carried out using the wilderness map ("<" from town level). As well 
as these main places, there are a number of additional dungeons which the 
character may or may not choose to enter, which can have guardians, contain 
specific artifacts, or just be used as an alternative place to enjoy gaining 
experience. Note that not all of the places are actually "dungeons" - some are
caves, forests, etc.

PernAngband also offers the player the ability to undertake a series of quests. 
Random quests can be specified during start-up, and involve rescuing a princess 
from a group of monsters within the dungeon. If you do not wish to play with 
random quests, simply specify "0" when asked how many you want during character 
generation. Other "fixed" quests are also available from the towns (whether 
random quests are enabled or not), usually given by the town leaders upon the 
request of the adventurer. It is not required for any adventurer to undertake 
the fixed quests, but they can result in some nice rewards.

The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and PernAngband is the 
greatly expanded choice in character classes and races, as well as an expanded 
magic system. Many races/classes can also have special abilities, which can be 
accessed through the "U" command. This gives a starting adventurer the ability 
to find a character that suits their own personal playing style.

To balance the expansion in things like player abilities and customisation, the 
list of both monsters and items has also been expanded. Be warned that items 
which were by default safe in Vanilla are not necessarily safe in Pern (a 
certain early artifact comes to mind here . . . ), and picking on some helpless 
creatures is frowned upon.

Happy 'Banding!
