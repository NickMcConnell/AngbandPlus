#####R === PernAngband Magic - Sigaldry Realm ===

Employed by minor wizards and dabblers in the alchemical arts, Sigaldry
focuses on drawing out relatively weak elemental and inner powers to 
both strike enemies and infuse energy into immobile objects. Associated
strongly with the more potent magics of Wizardry, it serves adequately
as an all-purpose spells school.

It contains few attack spells, many utility spells, some protection
spells, and a few enchanting spells.
