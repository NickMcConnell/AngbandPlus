#####R=== Harpers ===

#####GDescription
Harpers are like traditional musicians. Sort of. Their magical attacks 
are sound-based, and last as long as the Harper has mana. If the Harper
runs out of mana, he/she stops singing. There is also a low-level 
"spell" that will cease the song. Harpers cannot commence singing 
without light, however, if the light ceases, they can continue the 
song without.

While any class can use musical instruments, only harpers can tap the 
power of voice to aid themselves and hinder, dismay, and kill their 
foes. Unlike the spells of other classes, some songs can be persistent
- if the harper is prepared to continue making the considerable effort
needed to keep some tunes going. This means that a low-level harper can
have a lulling song playing in the background while he uses beams of
concentrated sound to slay the critters he slows down.

#####GPrimary Stats
Charisma (spellcasting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
A Harper can learn 32 songs from the *****m_music.txt*0[Music] Realm.

Harpers have four spellbooks, and play songs the same way as other
classes cast spells.  The most important song in any book is the second
one they learn:  "Stop Singing".

A harper will also appreciate a collection of musical instruments. 
All instruments activate for songs, which allows the harper to spend his
precious energies on music that can only be found in spellbooks.  Some
rarer instruments increase Charisma (a harper's spell stat) and grant
various resistances.  Artifact instruments exist; they possess unique
powers.

#####GStarting Equipment

    L1 songbook
    A dagger
    Soft leather armor
    A firelizard egg
If they are *very* lucky they may also begin with:
