********Monster or Unique Quest
This is the most common quest. The player is assigned to go to a specified depth and kill a certain number of monsters, or a specific unique monster. The creatures are usually out-of-depth for that level.  The number of monsters to kill varies each quest.

Unlike fixed quests, it is not mandatory to complete the quest in order to win the game.  A player can choose to dive right past the designated quest level, or leave and return to a quest level. Leaving an optional quest level without killing the required number of creatures can result in a failed quest. Completing a monster quest increased player fame by 10.  Failing a monster quest reduces total player fame by 55%.
*******<end>


********Guardian Quest
Similar to monster quests.  The player is tasked to go to a specified depth, and kill a certain number of monsters, or
a single unique. The monsters are usually significantly out-of-depth for that level.  The depth of the quest and number of monsters varies.

Unlike fixed quests, it is not mandatory to complete the quest in order to win the game.  Unlike a monster quest, a player cannot dive past the designated quest level until they complete the quest, and the player may leave and return to the level without killing the required number of creatures, without failing your quest.  The monsters are usually harder than those selected for a monter quest.  

The only ways to fail this quest are to die trying and to request to abandon the quest at the adventurer's guild.  A down staircase will appear when you complete this quest.  Completing a guardian quest increases player fame by 15.  Failing a monster quest reduces total player fame by 55%.
*******<end>
  

********Pit or Nest Quest
This quest is to go to a specified depth and kill or destroy every creature in a monster pit or nest.  A monster pit/nest has 95 creatures of a given theme.  Since there are so many like creatures bunched so closely together, a creature from inside one of these special pits/nests will not attempt to summon more creatures to the battle.  This type of quest tends to be more difficult than a monster or unique quest.  

Voluntarily leaving a Pit/Nest quest level before all 95 creatures are killed results in immediate quest failure.  Completing a Pit or Next quest increases player fame by 10 + 10d2.  Failing a monster quest reduces total player fame by 35%.  In addition to the guild quest reward, 5 monsters in the pit/next are holding an additional good item.
*******<end>


********Level Quest
This quest is a more difficult version of the Monster Pit/Nest quests.  Instead of 95 creatures in a pit or nest, the entire level is full of 200 or more monsters of a particular theme.  Since there are so many like creatures bunched so closely together, a creature from inside one of these themed levels only summon other creatures already on the level in battle.  

Voluntarily leaving a themed level results in immediate quest failure. Completing a Themed Level Quest increases player fame by 15 + 10d2.  Failing a themed level quest reduces total player fame by 35%.  In addition to the guild quest reward, many of the monsters on the level are holding an additional good item.
*******<end>


********Wilderness Quest
This quest is a collection quest type.  The player is tasked to go to a wilderness level that is gradually being overrun by lava or boiling mud.  The player needs to collect and return to the guild 20 pieces of faded scroll fragments.  The quest level starts with 10 scroll fragments on the ground, and 20 held by monsters.  Since there are so many like creatures bunched so closely together, a creature from inside one of these themed levels only summon other creatures already on the level in battle. Time is of the essense in this quest type, as the scroll fragments can be destroyed by fire, acid, or when the ground it is laying on gets overrun by lava or boiling mud.  In addition, the monsters will move to avoid the spreading lava or boiling mud, so they will close in on the player quicker than a typical level.  

Voluntarily leaving a wilderness level results in immediate quest failure.  Completing a Wilderness Level Quest increases player fame by 20 + 10d2.  Failing a wilderness quest reduces total player fame by 30%.  In addition to the guild quest reward, all wilderness levels contain between 3-6 chests on the ground.
*******<end>


*********Labyrinth Quest
This quest has a small labyrinth level.  4 Monsters or monster groups will appear every 20 game turns, one of which has been chosen at random to hold a small scroll fragment, which they will drop when you kill them.  Your goal is to collect 10 of them and return them to the guild.  The difficulty of the quest depends on the difficulty of the creatures on the level.  

Voluntarily leaving a Labrynth quest level results in immediate quest failure.  Completing a Labrynth Level Quest increases player fame by 25 + 10d2.  Failing a labrynth quest reduces total player fame by 30%.  Helpful objects will appear on the dungeon floor as well, if the player can get to them.
*******<end>



*********Artifact Vault Quest
This quest is to go to a specified depth, retrieve an artifact and return it to the guild, which is being held by a monster inside a small vault on a small level. The artifact is special in that it cannot be wielded by the player. Returning the artifact to the adventurer's guild completes the quest. The difficulty of this quest quest depends on the monsters guarding the artifact.  

You will most likely need some form of tunneling, such as a digging tool or a magic source of stone-to-mud, to gain access to the vault.   

Voluntarily leaving a level without the quest artifact results in immediate quest failure.  Completing an Artifact Quest increases player fame by 50.  Failing an artifact quest reduces total player fame by 50%.
*******<end>

********Arena Quest
The player starts in a small, empty room.  The quest is to kill 40 random creatures that appear in the room.  A group of monsters only counts as one.  The room will slowly expand, revealing items that will help the player survive.  This is one of the hardest quests, as the player will not be able to rest much while while wave after wave of monsters appear.  

Voluntarily leaving an arena level results in immediate quest failure.  Completing an Arena Quest increases player fame by 40 + 10d2.  Failing an arena quest reduces total player fame by 20%.
*******<end>


********Greater Vault Quest
The quest is the reward!  The player will arrive on a small dungeon level containing only a single greater vault.  The player must enter the greater vault and survive on the level for a fixed amount of turns.  A timer counts down how many player turns (at the current player speed) the player must remain on the level.  The player gains more time as they kill more vault creatures.  Once the timer expires, all monsters disappear, including all objects they are holding,  leaving the player to collect any loot remaining on the ground before they leave. In NPPAngband all vault objects are held by monsters instead of being on the floor.  This reward for this quest is the bounty of items waiting for the player inside the from the greater vault. The guild will offer only a moderate amount of gold as a quest reward. 

Voluntarily leaving the quest level before the timer expires, or allowing the quest time to expire without entering the greater vault, results in immediate quest failure. Completing a Greater Vault Quest increases player fame by 10.  Failing a greater vault quest reduces total player fame by only 10%.
