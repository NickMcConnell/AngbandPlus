<style:title>Draconians</style>

Draconians are a humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. There are several subtypes of draconians with different resistances, breaths and attributes. For example, Red Draconians are resistant to fire which they may also breathe at will, while White Draconians breathe and resist cold instead. All draconians levitate. In addition, when they mature enough, they may choose a special draconian power.

Red Draconians have an affinity for fire, which they both breathe at will and resist. Together with their White kin, they are the strongest in combat of the draconians. But they are not so good with magic and their stealth is quite poor. Should they choose the power of Dragon Skin, they will gain a fiery aura as well. Should they choose the power of Dragon Strike, their blows will burn their enemies.
