<style:title>Draconians</style>

Draconians are a humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. There are several subtypes of draconians with different resistances, breaths and attributes. For example, Red Draconians are resistant to fire which they may also breathe at will, while White Draconians breathe and resist cold instead. All draconians levitate. In addition, when they mature enough, they may choose a special draconian power.

Red Draconians have an affinity for fire, which they both breathe at will and resist. Together with their White kin, they are the strongest in combat of the draconians. But they are not so good with magic and their stealth is quite poor. Should they choose the power of Dragon Skin, they will gain a fiery aura as well. Should they choose the power of Dragon Strike, their blows will burn their enemies.

Hard of skin, the Crystal Draconian is difficult to hit in melee. But their agility suffers and they are not the brightest of their kind. They resist shards, which they may also breathe on command. With the power of Dragon Skin, they gain an aura of shards as well. With the power of Dragon Strike, even their melee attacks will shred their enemies.

Lithe, stealthy and nimble, the Shadow Draconian is seldom seen in this world. They are resistant to the forces of nether which they may also breathe. They are the weakest of the draconians, and the poorest in melee. But they are better than average with magic. With the power of Dragon Strike, they may steal life from their enemies in melee.
