=== Styles ===

        Each classes may choose to specialise in a particular style for a
        10% additional experience penalty. Some classes, notably Rangers
        and Priests are less powerful that the Vanilla Angband characters
        but may choose to regain their former abilities through particular
        choices of styles. To compensate, non-specialised Rangers and Priests
        have less of an experience penalty than their Vanilla counterparts.

        The styles confer a number of different benefits as explained below.
        More importantly, each class style suggests a particular sub-class
        type listed in brackets, that can be used to further distinguish
        different characters. The styles effectively expand the number of
        player classes from 9 to over 100.

        Important note: In order to take advantage of throwing weapons such
        as daggers, batons, darts, javelins and spears, and the additional
        benefits of throwing styles, you need to 'fire' rather than throw
        these weapons. This restricts the list of items you may choose to
        those balanced for throwing, but gives you the additional damage
        multiplier and shots of your style, and counts the to-hit and damage
        bonus of the weapon twice.  You cannot be wielding a bow, sling or

                cause additional critical damage at higher levels.

                against the enemies of their god. In return, the church
                and higher powers grant them a lessening of the restriction
                on blood-letting, to symbolically allow them to use blunt
                weapons. Though a mace may smash open a skull as effectively
                as an axe, the Templar priests are free to use hafted weapons

                identified at higher levels.

        Scrolls (Scholar)

                Scholars have a deep knowledge of ancient and modern magical
                writings and how they relate to the underlying spell
