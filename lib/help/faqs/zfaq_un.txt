Zangband FAQ 1.2   (for Zangband 2.0.4)

 [This is cryptic and unfriendly, and since it has lots of statistics
  and is already out of date, I decided to keep it separate from the
  rest of the online help.  I've removed all obsolete info and info
  that exists elsewhere in the online help. -- Trav]

[Not yet complete] 
Confusion: 
Stunning: 
Fear: 
Polymorph: Uniques cannot be polymorphed, nor can a
non-unique polymorph into a unique. Polymorph occurs if
ri(90)>rlev, the new monster will have level rlev +-
1+(ri(20)/ri(9)), chosen from a distribution affected in some
way by 5+(dlev+rlev)/2, with two 2% chances of boosting this
by max(5,2+(5+(dlev+rlev)/2)/4) It all gets a bit hazy after this,
there is lots of table lookups and two further chances to boost
the monster level. TODO 
Teleport:

Notes: 
------

plev is used to refer to the player level. 
mlev is used to refer to monster level. 
ilev is used to refer to item level. 
ri(N) is used to refer to randint(N), a random number 1 <= x < N 
r(dam) is used to refer to the damage done by area-affect
  spells, and is equal to (dam + distance to centre of
  blast)/(distance to centre of blast +1). 

The notation {2(Pr),4(Oth)} means 2 is the character is a
Priest, else 4 mResChance means the monster has (mlev >
ri(max(1,r(plev)-10))+10) chance of resisting the effect. 
stdbeam = {plev{Mg},(plev/2){Oth)} 
beam(x) means x% chance of bolt spell becoming a beam spell.

dam19 means damage is reduced to 1/9th if monsters resists. 
dam26 means damage is reduced to (dam*2)/(6+ri(6)) if monster resists. 
dam36 means damage is reduced to (dam*3)/(6+ri(6)) if monster resists. 
stdResist means is resisted if rlev>(10+ri(min(1,dam-10)))

3. Finish Politics
=============================================================================

[From usenet post by Topi Ylinen]
Ok, here's the 'official' explanation: 

When the original code for Zangband was written years ago, we were voting for
the new president. There were a number of strong candidates, among them 
the democrat Martti Ahtisaari (who would be elected in the vote) and 
Paavo Väyrynen. These two were very likely to carry on to the second round
of the vote (since nobody seemed likely to gain more than 50% of the votes,
required to win the first round so completely that no second round would
be needed). 

Martti Ahtisaari weighed 127 kg at the time, and played Mr. Nice-guy. He had
a career in the UN, and he would always do things which made him look unselfish
and diplomatic. That's why Martti Ihrasaari says what he says in Zangband
(Ahtisaari = "Ahti's Island", Ihrasaari = "Fat Island"). 

Paavo Väyrynen is a much better known figure to the Finns. He's the kind of
political gambler who would always do anything (sell his mother, burn his
kids, or whatever) if it profited him. He would change his opinions and
decisions immediately if he believed that gave him some kind of advantage.
He's not the kind of person you would trust (or if you did, I'd call you
a fool). Curiously, during the elections, books were published that 
told all kinds of nasty things about the major candidates, but -- surprise,
surprise -- no such book was published about Paavo Väyrynen. What a 
coincidence. When Mr Väyrynen heard he didn't make it to the second
round, he cried in front of tv cameras...
(The books thing explains why Mr Vaaranen said what he did in Zangband --
Vaaranen should actually be Vääränen, "the wrongful one").

Why you get to chop these politicians to pieces? Well, I am not normally
interested in politics, it is just the obligatory pun at the prominent
politicians of the time, adapted to Angband standards.

4. Artifacts and Ego Items
============================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Artifacts 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section only shows the random abilities that are determined
at run-time. All other abilities for these artifacts can be
determined by reading the lib/a_info.txt file. 

Terror Mask
  - if warrior, EGO_XTRA_ABILITY and a high resist
    else heavy curse, aggravate, ty_curse 

Julian, Arvedui, Caspanion, Hithlomir, Rohirrim, Celegorm, Anarion, Thranduil,
Luthien, Thror, Thorin, Nimthanc, Dethanc, Narthanc, Sting, Turmil
  - all get a high resist. 

Maedhros, Glamdring, Orcrist, Anduril, Zarcuthra, Gurthang, Soulsword, Brand 
  - all get a high resist (50%) or EGO_XTRA_ABILITY 

Nenya, Vilya, Beruthiel, Fingolfin, Thingol, Ulmo, Gandalf
  - get EGO_XTRA_ABILITY. 

The One Ring, Amber, Aule
  - get a high resist and EGO_XTRA_ABILITY. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7b. Ego Items 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In all cases the random abilities that Zangband adds to these ego
items have been included. In some cases the abilities from the
e_info.txt file have been extracted as well. Eventually all of the
abilities for these items will be listed here. 

***************
*** Weapons ***
***************

Trump Weapon:
  Slay Evil, Teleportation, Free Action, Regeneration, Slow
  Digestion, Resist Nexus and a Searching bonus. They activate
  for teleport every 50+1d50 turns. They also get a random high
  resistance, and have a 1 in 5 chance of getting slay demon as
  well. 1 in 7 chance of EGO_XTRA_ABILITY. One annoying
  thing about these items (especially if you are using the roguelike
  keyset) is that they ask you if you want to teleport every so
  often. See the section on the teleport patch for a fix to this. 

Vampirics:
  Hold Life, Vampiric drain. This sucks life from non-undead
  opponents and gives it to you. *Very* powerful ability, making
  Vampirics competitive with even artifact weaponry. 

Chaotic Weapons:
  Resist Chaos, Chaotic [randomly drains the enemy (dunno what
  effect it actually has), confuses the enemy or cause an
  earthquake. Could do more, not sure.], and get a random
  resistance (low or high). 

Pattern Weapons:
  Slay Evil, Slay Demon, Slay Undead, Free Action, See Invisible
  and a bonus to STR and CON. They also get a 1 in 3 chance of
  Hold Life, a 1 in 3 chance of a dexterity bonus, and a 1 in 5
  chance of Resist Fear, along with a random high resistance. 

Weapons of Slaying:
  33% chance of double damage dice, else at least +1 to both # of
  dice, and size of dice. (For each of them, it adds one, then rolls
  a random number from 1 to the current value. If this is one, it
  does this again.) 1 in 5 chance of poison brand. If a sword-type
  weapon, then 1 in 3 chance of Vorpal. 

Westernesse weapons have a 1 in 3 chance of getting Resist
  Fear. Bonus to str, dex and con. Slay Orc, Troll, Giant, Free
  Action, See Invisitble. 

Defenders get a high resist, and 1 in 3 chance of Resist Poison.
  (If the high resist rolled is Resist Poison, that's the only high
  resist you'll get -- high resists aren't rerolled just because the
  weapon already has the ability.) 

Blessed Weapons: Blessed, EGO_XTRA_ABILITY 

Slay Undead weapons all get Hold Life. 
*Slay* Undead weapons get additional Resist Nether. 

*Slay Evil* weapons are blessed and get resist fear. 

Holy Avengers have a 1 in 4 chance of getting extra blows, EGO_XTRA_SUSTAIN. 

Slay Dragon weapons get a random low resist. 
*Slay Dragon* weaponry has a 1 in 3 chance of getting an
additional Resist Poison, plus it gets another resistance, which is
limited to low resists and Resist Poison (1 in 7 poison,
otherwise low). 

Earthquakes: 33% chance of extra attacks. 

Bow of Extra Might give a random_resistance (any except for
immunities). 

***************
*** Armour  ***
***************

Crowns: 
      Magi: random high resist, EGO_XTRA_POWER 
      Might: random high resist 
      Lordliness: random high resist 
      Seeing: 1 in 3 chance of telepathy. 

Helm of Seeing: 1 in 3 chance of telepathy. 

Gauntlets of Power, Boots of Slow Descent: random high
resist. 

Armor of Resistance resistance plus has a 1 in 4 chance of
getting Resist Poison, plus a random high resist. 
Shields of Resistance resistance plus a random high resist. 

Cloak of Aman: EGO_XTRA_POWER 

Robe of Permanence: EGO_XTRA_POWER 

Armor of Elvenkind: EGO_XTRA_POWER 

Helmets and crowns of Seeing have a chance of granted
telepathy (1 in 7 for helmets, 1 in 3 for crowns). 

Dragon Sheilds/Helm always gives you at least 1
random_resistance. After that you have a 50% chance getting a
second, another 50% chance of getting a third and so on. Each
resistances is determined as follows: 1 in 4 chance of getting a
low resist or poison resistance, and a 3 in 4 chance of getting a
high resist not including fear, poison, light or darkness. 

*************
*** Other ***
*************

Ring of Lordly Protection: large plus to AC (at least +10), hold
life, free action, resist disenchantment, and one guaranteed high
resist (excluding fear and poison) with each time it gets one,
25% chance of getting another. 

Amulet of the Magi: 1 in 3 chance of slow digestion. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

high resist: one of blind, conf, sound, shards, nether, nexus,
             chaos, disen, light, dark, fear, poison 
low resist: one of fire, cold, acid, elec 
any resist: 12 in 34 chance of low. otherwise high. 
EGO_XTRA_SUSTAIN: sustain con and sustain chr are slightly
  (42 in 256, instead of 43 in 256) less likely 
EGO_XTRA_POWER: one of blind, conf, sound (24 in 256 each), 
   shards, nether, nexus, chaos, disen, poison, dark, light (23 in 256) 
EGO_XTRA_ABILITY: one of feather fall, light, see invis,
