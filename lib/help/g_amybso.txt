#####GAmyBSOD's Magic
Worshipping AmyBSOD gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of AmyBSOD. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that AmyBSOD will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for her help without offending her!

There is a special book called the "Colorful Tome of Rainbows" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers AmyBSOD will
grant. There are three prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BBanshee Scream] (Level 1)
   Scream like a banshee to damage the monsters' ears and daze them.
   Sometimes it can blast through its first target.
2. [[[[[BLights Out] (Level 20)
   Conjures a ball of darkness to punch the monsters' lights out
3. [[[[[BTrololololol] (Level 30)
   Summons a troll that fights on your side
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, AmyBSOD will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_fire.txt*0[Fire School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_meta.txt*0[Meta School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.
    
AmyBSOD also grants all of her followers access to the *****m_udun.txt*0[Udun] school of magic,
but only powerful mages are able to cast all of its spells.

The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
