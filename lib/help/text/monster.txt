Monsters

Encounters with monsters are the backbone of FrogComposband. It is 
mostly by killing monsters that you acquire treasures, gain experience 
and become more powerful; but not all monsters are hateful enemies who 
need to die.

Monster Races

Each monster in the game represents some specific monster kind, usually 
known for convenience as the monster's race. (The term is somewhat 
misleading in that it does not necessarily imply a distinct species or 
ethnicity; human novice mages, human novice priests and human novice 
archaeologists are three separate monster races; also, I use semicolons 
too much.) Race determines most things about a monster: which melee 
attacks (if any) it can hit you with, which spells (if any) it can use, 
which of your attacks (if any) it can shrug off.

Two monsters of the same race are not completely identical - there is 
some variation between individuals in terms of details such as hit 
points and speed - but most of the time you can ignore that variation 
and treat all members of a monster race as interchangeable, as impolite 
as that might seem. Distinct races, on the other hand, are far from 
interchangeable; each poses a unique challenge, apart from the few who 
pose no challenge at all.

Monster Species

Monster races can be grouped into categories (or species). Two monsters 
of the same species are always represented on the map by the same 
letter symbol; for example, all orcs share the letter o. Monsters of 
the same race also share the color (all orc warlocks are o). It is 
possible, but relatively rare, for a monster race to share both its 
letter and its color with another race of the same species.

The symbols for all monster species are listed below.

Unlike the race, the species of a monster does not tell you anything 
about how dangerous a monster is; the almost harmless giant green frog 
is a reptile/amphibian with the symbol R... but so is Godzilla. The 
species does, however, allow some generic assumptions; for example, 
nearly all dragons and zephyr hounds breathe something or other. You 
can also assume something with the d or D symbol will take extra damage 
from a weapon that slays dragons.

Assessing a Monster

The cheapest way to tell who a monster is and how much damage he deals 
in combat is by picking a fight with them and finding out. This can 
lead to complications such as death, though, so you may want to take a 
more measured approach.

Use the * targetting command or the l look command to inspect a 
monster. Here I have used the * command to discover that the h to my 
north-east is a Nibelung:

If you are playing for the first time, just knowing the monster is a 
Nibelung does not help that much - what are Nibelungs like?! You can

Quest: L5

Had we met Nibelungs before, this screen would be populated with useful 
information. We haven't, so there's really just the speed and the 
flavor description... but the latter does strongly suggest that 
nibelungs might be thieves. (Jumping ahead of ourselves for a bit, it 
also implies there might be a unique nibelung called Alberich!)

If I let the nibelung hit me a couple times, we find out I was right 
about nibelungs being thieves, and the monster recall updates with this 
new information:

Quest: L5


Notice also the monster status bar on the right - that little 
h[**-------]? It indicates how healthy a monster is: I hit that 
Nibelung a couple times in return, and the seven empty slots next to 
the two red stars tell me he is already down to a fraction of his 
original health. Nibelungs probably aren't too tough if I could do so 
much damage so quickly! (See [a] below for a more detailed explanation 
of the status bar.)

Unique Monsters

While there are many humans in the world, there is only one of you. 
Likewise, many monsters can only be killed once, and these monsters are 
called unique monsters or simply uniques. A large part of the game 
involves killing as many uniques as possible. In fact, you need to kill 
a certain unique to win the game: the Serpent of Chaos. Many quests 
also involve killing a unique.

Uniques are typically some of the toughest monsters you will meet at a 
given depth. Many uniques, especially in the early game, are just 
bigger, badder versions of a regular monster; Mughash the Kobold Lord, 
for example, could be fairly described as a normal kobold who hits 
harder, has extra hitpoints and takes a posse of friends with him 
everywhere he goes. It is not unusual, however, for a unique to truly 
be one of a kind and have little in common with anybody else.

The flipside to uniques' toughness is that they also drop some of the 
best treasures. A number of uniques even have special drops - the 
unique Arthur Pendragon, for example, might drop the highly valuable 
sword Excalibur. But that is a long way from guaranteed!

A unique does not belong to any other monster race; from the game's 
point of view, each unique is a monster race of its own.

  Uniques' Resistance to Magic
  
  Unique monsters tend to be more resistant to magic than the other 
  dungeon inhabitants. In particular, almost no magic is powerful 
  enough to slow uniques or make them fall asleep. Uniques who resist 
  Teleportation are always completely immune to it (most normal 
  monsters only get a saving throw). In addition, Genocide and 
  Mass-Genocide effects (see [b] below) will never work on a unique.
  
  Speaking Uniques
  
  Occasionally, you will find that a unique monster will speak to you 
  as it approaches. Typically, a monster will shout insults and 
  challenges to combat; but they may also mention topics relating to 
  themselves, or just engage in friendly chatter if they are less 
  hostile. The game has no mechanism to allow you to respond (other 
  than with violence). Speaking is not strictly limited to uniques, but 
  is much rarer in normal monster races.
  
  Wanted Uniques
  
  For every character you play, the game rolls a new random list of 
  twenty wanted uniques. You can view this list at the Bounty Offices 
  in Outpost, Thalos and Anambar, and review it at any time through the 
  ~ knowledge-menu command. When you kill a wanted unique, you are 
  reminded of the price on its head; pick up the corpse or skeleton and 
  turn it in at the Bounty Office, and you will receive one or more 
  valuable items as a reward for your good work.
  
  The list of wanted uniques is sorted by the native depth of the 
  unique; killing deeper uniques gives better rewards.
  

Listing All Monsters in View

Using the * command to inspect a single monster is great when you only 
have to worry about one monster, but often dozens of monsters will be 
nearby at once. Here's a more advanced character who has just walked 
into a quest and cast a magical monster-detection spell - who are all 
these guys?

That is still a lot of information; but the list is ordered primarily 
by line-of-sight (the two energy hounds go first because they are in 
direct view) and secondarily by the native depth of the monster, which 
is a rough indicator of the threat level. So the monsters near the top 
of the list are the ones we should worry about the most.

The highest level monster in there is an ancient green dragon, a very 
nasty enemy in the wrong circumstances. My experience with the game 
makes me even more worried about the bodak and in particular the logrus 
master - but those are still near the top, so I spotted them easily.
Luckily for me, the list has colored these monsters black rather than 
white, indicating they are still asleep. (Unique monsters, here the 
Ultimate Dungeon Cleaner, are listed in violet.)

Not all of the monsters listed were actually visible in that earlier 
screenshot - many were offscreen, but still within detection range, so 
they show up on the monster list. All the better for us!

You can press R to bring up additional information through the monster 
list; I chose the fire angel for this purpose here because that 
happened to be a monster this character already knew things about:

A level 37 evil dragon with +10 speed who breathes plasma... you can 
see why the fire angel was also listed near the top.

Monster Colors

Monsters associated with a particular element (damage type) are often 
color-coded. The most common and reliable associations are Red with 
fire and White with cold/frost - a red dragon, for example, breathes 
fire, bites to burn and is resistant to your own fire attacks. (This 
does not mean all red monsters will be fire-based, only that most 
fire-based monsters are red.)

Other similar associations include Blue with lightning/electricity, 
Black and Slate with acid, Green with poison, Bronze with confusion, 
Gold with sound and Silver with inertia. Multi-hued monsters flicker in 
all colours and are typically associated with multiple elements; 
multi-hued dragons and multi-hued hounds both breathe and resist all of 
the five common elements (acid, cold, fire, electricity and poison).

These general rules are not completely airtight - the acid-breathing 
Water Hounds, for example, are Z instead of the expected Z or Z. (This 
particular case is actually quite bizarre, in that they used to be Z in 
older versions of the game.)

Eldritch Horrors

Some of the monsters in the dungeons are so fearsome that just to look 
upon them can have serious repercussions. When you see one of these 
sanity-blasting monsters, one (or more) of several nasty things may 
happen to you; these include having your intelligence and wisdom 
temporarily reduced, becoming scared or confused, and suffering an 
attack of hallucinations or amnesia.

If you can cope with your first sighting of a sanity-blasting monster, 
you can then safely keep that monster in view; it will not trigger the 
Eldritch Horror effect as long as it remains in view. It is possible 
for the effect to be triggered if the monster walks out of view and is 
then seen again, but a single monster very rarely blasts your sanity 
more than once.

Although all player characters have some chance to resist sanity 
blasting, only a handful ever become fully immune to it.

Pets and Riding

What could be nicer than a loyal pet? People sometimes worry their pets 
will trample them underfoot; but in FrogComposband, pets will never 
attack you by mistake. You can walk around safely as your pet Great 
Hell Wyrm obliterates your enemies. Better still, some pets can summon 
new pets.

One might think that pets can make the game much easier. It is of 
course highly satisfying to send your pet Wyrm into a troll pit and 
wait outside listening for the howls of agony and terror, the sounds of 
guts splattering, bones crunching and so on; but one should not expect 
to gain much experience from this. You only earn full experience when 
you deliver the death blow yourself.

Pets retain some self-preservation instincts; at low health, a pet may 
decide to quit the fight (and the level) rather than to die for his 
master. Another limitation to the usefulness of pets is the rule that 
unique monsters can only be killed by you and never by another monster, 
including pets; pets can harm uniques, but not finish them off. (This 
is relaxed for player Quylthulgs due to their exceptional reliance on 
pets.)

The practical approach to pets varies widely from player to player; 
some successful players like keeping pets, while others just ignore the 
possibility. Pets are not needed to win (on most characters), but they 
are fun!

  Obtaining a Pet
  
  You may obtain pets in several different ways. Some magic realms 
  offer the ability to summon pets magically or to charm the creatures 
  you meet. Mindcrafters may 'dominate' their opponents. Chaos patrons 
  may grant pets as a gift to their devotees. Magical figurines can be 
  thrown to create a pet (though they might be cursed and create an 
  enemy!); and wands of charm monster may be used as their name 
  suggests.
  
  The Capture Ball is a useful tool that (almost) any player can use. 
  Capture Balls can often be bought at a General Store. To use one, you 
  must wield it on your hand, then Activate it, and choose a target 
  monster to be captured; if successful, you can then Activate the ball 
  again to release the monster as your pet.
  
  Hostile monsters will attempt to resist capturing, and can only be 
  captured if they are critically injured. Beastmasters are very good 
  at using Capture Balls, and this limitation is relaxed for them. 
  Quest monsters are immune to being captured, as are uniques who are 
  not already pets.
  
  Keeping Pets Happy
  
  Pets will accept punishment from you; hurt a pet, and it remains your 
  pet. But what pets do expect from you is attention! This is called 
  pet upkeep and consumes some of your mana; the more pets you have, 
  and the stronger they are, the higher the upkeep. At low upkeep 
  (below 100%), no mana is actually lost, the upkeep just slows mana 
  regeneration (this allows characters with no mana to keep some pets). 
  But at higher levels of upkeep, you will lose mana; run out of mana, 
  and you have no option but to dismiss enough pets to bring the upkeep 
  level down. This often happens if you have a pet who likes to 
  summon...
  
  At grossly excessive upkeep levels (starting around 500%), a red 
  upkeep warning appears in your status bar. At this point, pets have a 
  chance to feel neglected from lack of attention. Neglected pets 
  sometimes turn hostile, but more often they just think "bugger this 
  for a game of heroes" and leave the level.
  
  Pet Evolution
  
  Pets, like players, receive experience when they kill a hostile 
  monster. With enough experience, some pets may evolve into stronger 
  monsters; for example, your baby multi-hued dragon might become a 
  young multi-hued dragon, then a mature multi-hued dragon, and 
  eventually a mighty Wyrm of Many Colours!
  
  One problem, though: evolving into very strong forms takes a long 
  time, and placing a pet into a Capture Ball causes the pet to lose 
  all experience. It will not devolve back into its original form, but 
  loses any progress it had made towards the next form.
  
  Commanding Your Pets
  
  Your pets are fairly well trained and will respond to a variety of 
  commands such as following you closely, staying nearby and searching 
  out your enemies. You can command your pets using the pet command 
  menu which can be found be pressing p.
  
  Here is a list of available pet commands:
  
  Dismiss Pets
    Dismiss specified pets. Dismissed pets will immediately disappear 
    from the current level. FrogComposband asks you whether you want to 
    dismiss each pet in order from high level named pets to low level 
    unnamed pets. You can press 'U' to dismiss all unnamed pets.
  
  Specify Target of Pet
    Choose a target monster; all your pets will begin to chase the 
    target. This command causes pets to pathfind much more aggressively 
    in cases where enemies are not in their line of sight.
  
  Stay Close
    Command your pets to slay as close as they can.
  
  Follow Me
    Command your pets to follow you as you move about.
  
  Seek and Destroy
    Command your pets to chase monsters near you.
  
  Give Me Space
    Command your pets to go away from your line of sight.
  
  Stay Away
    Command your pets to go away as far as they can.
  
  Pets Open Doors
    Toggle permission of pets to open doors.
  
  Pets Pick Up Items
    Toggle permission of pets to pick up items. Pets will drop any 
    items picked up earlier.
  
  Allow Teleport
    Toggle permission of pets to cast teleport spell and teleport away 
    spell.
  
  Allow Cast Attack Spell
    Toggle permission of pets to use breaths and attack spells.
  
  Allow Cast Summon Spell
    Toggle permission of pets to cast summoning spells.
  
  Allow Involve Player in Area Spell
    Toggle permission of pets to use ball spells or breath attacks even 
    when you are close enough to take collateral damage.
   
  Ride a Pet
    Ride on a specified pet.
  
  Get Off a Pet
    Dismount from the pet you were riding.
  
  Name Pets
    Specify a target pet and name it.
  
  Highlight Pets on Map
    Toggles highlighting all pets in yellow.
  
  Highlight Pets in Lists
    Toggles highlighting all pets in yellow on the monster list. Also 
    highlights friendly monsters in green.
  
  Use Both Hands for a Weapon
  Use One Hand to Control a Riding Pet
    Toggle use of your left hand when you are riding. You can wield a 
    weapon two-handed for maximum damage in melee, and command the 
    riding pet to chase your target using the 'specify target of pet' 
    command.
  
  Riding
  Not all pets are suitable for riding, but many are - horses, most 
  dragons, and many others. To control your mount, you must keep one 
  hand free for holding the reins; but your pet will attack your target 
  together with you, and enemy attacks will be dispersed between you 
  and your mount. As a result, you will take less damage in combat.
  
  The most important feature of riding is speed. When you are riding on 
  a pet, your speed does not depend on your original speed but only on 
  the speed of your mount and your skill at riding. Quaffing a potion 
  of speed has no effect on your mount's speed, but throwing it at a 
  wall will hasten your pet if it is nearby. You can also simply use a 
  wand or a spell of Haste Monster.
  
  Note that your proficiency level for riding is very low at first (see 
  'Proficiency' in the ~ Knowledge Menu). When your proficiency level 
  is low, you cannot make good use of riding, and your speed while 
  riding will be very low. You need to practice riding to gain the full 
  speed of the creature you ride. Your riding proficiency will increase 
  a little when you attack monsters in melee or shoot them with missile 
  weapons while riding. Ride on low level creatures at first, and then 
  switch to higher level mounts little by little.
  
  You can also use the ~ Knowledge Menu to check your class-dependent 
  proficiency cap for riding. If the cap is low, you will never get 
  good at riding and are likely better off with another plan.
  
Friendly Monsters

You will occasionally find a monster in the dungeon that isn't out to 
get you. Such monsters are described in game messages as being 
'friendly'. A friendly monster will not attempt to hurt you, but 
neither will it necessarily attack your enemies.

Unlike pets, if you hurt a friendly monster it will turn against you. 
Like pets, any monsters a friendly monster summons will also be 
friendly (except in the case of really stupid friends, who summon 
indiscriminately). Unlike pets, friendly monsters require no mana 
upkeep and cannot be commanded using the pet commands.

Note that the loyalty of friendly monsters' friendly summons may be to 
the original friendly monster, not you; if you piss him off, his 
summons might not take your side in the fight...

Since uniques can never be killed by another monster, only by you, a 
friendly unique is a huge asset - who's going to stop them from killing 
everyone for you? Friendly uniques are very rare, though; and 
Politicians (the class most likely to have friendly uniques on their 
side) may find them escaping as their health is depleted.

Mimics and Shadowers

A number of monsters disguise themselves by assuming the shape (and 
symbol) of common objects found in the dungeon. These include the |, (, 
?, !, &, =, ~, $ and * symbols. Some players find this unfair (or 
unfun); to provide for them we have the easy_mimics display option [c], 
which changes the symbols for most of these monsters to the special 
symbol x. This reduces immersion a bit, but if you hate being chopped 
to pieces by something you had thought was a cloak, go for it!

These traditional mimics are not the only monsters who are trying to 
hide their identity. There are also shadowers, who might seem easily 
recognizable by the distinctive N symbol... except that shadowers are 
not a distinct race at all. Shadowers are monsters of other races, 
hiding their true identity. At times it is obvious who a shadower 
really is, at other times you may have to think. Most of the time 
shadowers are fairly harmless, but don't rely on it completely. 
Shadowers are quite rare, and uniques never appear as a shadower.

Two further monster races like to play games with their appearance: the 
chameleons and the tanuki. Chameleons are true shape-changers: they 
assume not just the appearance but also the characteristics of another 
monster, and act like that monster in every way except that they might 
suddenly change shape. Tanuki, on the other hand, only look like 
monsters of another race; they are actually quite harmless, but might 
spook you into thinking otherwise.

Breeding Monsters

There are a few monsters with the ability to breed explosively - they 
can multiply very fast, and fill entire rooms with new monsters of the 
same type. (It is probably best not to think too closely about exactly 
how they do this.) Breeders are rarely dangerous (with one notable 
exception), but they can be extremely annoying, especially on quest 
levels.

It is best to kill breeders before they multiply out of control. They 
are very rare in town quests (where the stipulation for completion is 
often that you must empty the entire level of monsters!), but when they 
do appear in a town quest, they should always be your top priority. 
Breeders are particularly likely to be a pain if you select the Sexy 
personality; most characters can hope to catch the breeder asleep and 
kill it before it has the chance to multiply, but the aggravation on 
Sexy characters wakes everybody up and removes this possibility.

Even in extreme cases, an entire level will never be filled with 
breeders (unless it's a really tiny level): there is a strict limit of 
no more than 100 breeders at a time. Farming breeders by deliberately 
letting them multiply so you can kill them for XP does not work very 
well in this game; the experience you can gain this way is very limited 
and tails off rapidly. There are many other ways to level up that are 
more interesting and productive.

Monster Knowledge

Because there are so many different kinds of monster (about 1300) and 
many of them share similar colors and symbols, it is very difficult to 
keep track of what each of them can do, especially when you are still 
new to the game. Luckily, the game automatically keeps track of your 
experiences with each monster; you will remember the melee, spell and 
breath attacks you have suffered, which of your own magical attacks it 
resisted, whether it dropped treasure, whether you saw it multiply, and 
how much XP you got for killing it.
 
There are several ways to access this monster lore. Two were already 
shown above - pressing * to target a visible monster and then r to 
recall the information, and pressing Y to view the monster list and 
then R to recall the lore on a particular monster.

These approaches only work if the monster you would like to know more 
about is currently visible, but you can use the ~ knowledge menu 
(select the Known Monsters submenu) to access the lore on any monster 
at any time. This is about what you will see:

If you now press ? or r on a particular monster, everything you know 
about that monster will be displayed.

This monster knowledge is still incomplete, though - it only tells you 
what you have learned through your experiences; if you want to know all 
there is to know about a monster without having to fight it over and 
over again, there are three ways to reach that goal.

You can probe a nearby monster with the Probing spell (or item effect); 
this will reveal everything about both that individual monster and 
about its race. Another option is to find your local Beastmaster (most 
though not all towns have one; the Library serves this function in the 
no-wilderness town) and pay to have a monster race researched; this 
also reveals everything about that race. The final way is to just turn 
on the Easy Lore birth option ([d]), which gives you full monster lore 
at birth; this does make the game a bit easier, but maybe that's what 
you want!

You will retain your monster knowledge for as long as you use the same 
savefile, even if your character dies; the monster memory is not just 
for your character, but for you.

It Resists...

Your cool bag of magical tricks is not guaranteed to have the same 
effect on every enemy; many monsters have an inherent resistance, 
sometimes even an immunity, to a particular damage type or status 
effect. An immunity means such an attack has no effect on the monster 
at all. A resistance to an element (for example fire) means the damage 
taken by the monster is greatly reduced, but a small amount of damage 
is still taken. Resisting against a status effect means a monster 
survived a saving throw against the effect; the higher the monster's 
level compared to the attack power, the better the monster's chance to 
resist. (Typically, this does not require a specific resistance; most 
status effects give all monsters a chance to resist, while some are 
completely immune.)

Some monsters have immunities just by virtue of what they are; for 
example, all Nonliving monsters, Demons and Undead are immune to 
vampirism. Undead monsters also cannot be harmed by nether.

The various feedback messages of the type "so-and-so is immune", 
"so-and-so resists" and "so-and-so is unaffected" sometimes leave 
players unsure as to whether it might be worth trying the same attack 
again; though "so-and-so is immune" reliably means you can forget about 
it. In the case of resistances noted in the monster lore (elemental 
resistances, status effect resistances, teleportation) you can look in 
the lore if you are uncertain; if the message you just got means the 
monster has a resistance or an immunity, that information will now 
appear in the lore.

Genocide

Some powerful magical spells and devices allow you to genocide a 
monster species (all monsters sharing a given letter symbol). Genocide 
attempts to remove all monsters of the specified species from the level 
you are currently on.

Genocide is not always fully effective; it does not affect uniques or 
quest monsters (including town quest monsters), and monsters other than 
uniques have a level-dependent chance to resist. Monsters who 
successfully resist genocide have a small chance of acquiring immunity 
to future attempts. Another downside is the strain involved in casting 
genocide: you will take some damage for each monster affected. The 
damage taken per monster is very small, but if the number of monsters 
is high, casting genocide can hurt you seriously or even kill you. 
(This does not happen if your chaos patron offers you a free genocide; 
in this case, it is the patron casting genocide, he is just letting you 
pick the species.)

Two other spell effects are closely related and follow the same basic 
rules as Genocide does. Annihilation targets a single monster (even 
this is enough for it to be very valuable!), and Mass Genocide affects 
all non-unique monsters regardless of species, but is limited to your 
immediate surroundings (monsters within 20 squares of you) instead of 
affecting the entire level.

Genocide is based on the underlying "true" letter symbols of monsters, 
and ignores any changes made by the player to the visual appearance of 
a monster. For example, casting genocide on the symbol x would have no 
effect on mimics even if you turned the easy_mimics option on, because 
x is not these mimics' true symbol. Similarly, genociding D would 
affect ancient dragons even if you had changed their visual appearance 
to something else.

Friendly monsters will always be turned hostile by a failed attempt to 
genocide them, even if they are uniques and there was no chance the 
genocide would harm them personally. Genocide can affect pets (it will 
not turn them hostile), although your mount will never be affected.

New players with previous experience in other roguelikes, but not in 
Angband variants, sometimes expect Genocide or Mass Genocide to remove 
a monster race or species from the game permanently. This does not 
happen; genocide only affects monsters on a single level, and even 
there, they have a chance to resist. In spite of these limitations, 
sources of Genocide and Mass Genocide are extremely valuable, and many 
players stockpile them for the end fights.

Health Bar Colors

The number of stars in a monster's status/health bar always indicates 
the monster's health; the color of the stars reveals some additional 
information about the monster. Here is a quick guide to health bar 
colors, ordered from highest priority to lowest (if multiple colors 
apply, the color with the highest priority is used):

      U[*********]   Monster is invulnerable
      U[*********]   Monster is paralyzed or sleeping
      U[*********]   Monster is confused
      U[*********]   Monster is stunned
      U[*********]   Monster is afraid
      U[*--------]   Monster is below 10% health
      U[**-------]   Monster is below 25% health
      U[*****----]   Monster is below 60% health
      U[*********]   Monster is below 100% health
      U[*********]   Monster is at full health
      U[---------]   Monster's status and location are unknown
