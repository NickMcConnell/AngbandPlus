Creating a Character

PosChengband is a role playing game, in which you, the player, control 
a character in a dangerous world of myth and magic. The most important 
decision you make on your quest to the kill Morgoth, Lord of Darkness 
is what kind of character to play: Spell-wielding magician or 
sword-waving warrior? Stealthy rogue or musical bard? Holy priest or 
evil spawn of chaos? The choices are myriad and the process of 
generating a new character is described in this help file, which will 
also serve to introduce you to many of the core concepts of the game.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of 
choices. You must choose your character's race (Human, Elf, Hobbit, 
Orc, Undead, Demon, etc), your character's class (Warrior, Mage, 
Priest, Rogue, etc) and you character's personality (Mighty, Shrewd, 
Patient, etc). Each of these choices are described in the help files 
(see [a]).

There are three main screens for the birth process. The first is a 
brief welcome screen in which you select the type of game to play (the 
Game Mode). The next screen allows you to select or change your race, 
class, gender, personality and character's name. The final screen 
allows you to enter your starting stats. We will describe each of these 
screens in detail, explaining things as we go. Ready?

The Welcome Screen
The first screen is the Welcome Screen. It simply introduces you to the 
game and allows you to choose one of several options that will control 
the birth process. It looks someting like this:
  
  Welcome to PosChengband, a dungeon exploration role playing game. Your
  goal is to defeat Morgoth, Lord of Darkness, but before you can face
  him, you must battle many foes. Your first step is to create a
  character for this quest. The following screens will guide you through
  this process so that you may quickly begin playing. You can get general
  help at any time by pressing ?.
  
  First, you must decide what type of game to play. If you are new, it is
  recommended you play in Beginner Mode.
  
  Choose the Type of Game to Play
    b) Beginner
    n) Normal
    m) Monster
  
    =) Options
    ?) Help
    s) View Scores
  ESC) Quit
  
  Tip: You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter
       for a command. For example, type B on this screen to receive help
       on Beginner Mode.
  

If you are new to the game then it is highly recommended you choose the 
Beginner option. With this option, you won't be so overwhelmed with 
choices as is normally the case, allowing you to breeze through the 
birth process and quickly begin playing (and enjoying) this game. Once 
you have played a few times and wish to experience more that the game 
has to offer, including a vast wilderness with many diverse dungeons to 
explore, then you should choose the Normal option.

If you are truly bold, you can experiment with the Monster option which 
allows you to play as one of many different types of monster. Monsters 
don't have a class, but instead evolve into more powerful forms as they 
gain experience. They also tend to have variable body types, making the 
equipment sub-game both more fun and more challenging.

For the remainder of this document, and most of the rest of the help 
files, we will be assuming you are playing with the Normal option, 
which includes the full array of race and class choices.

Also on this screen may be an option to Quick Start. This option simply 
repeats the birth options from your previous character, who presumably 
just met an untimely demise. This is a useful option if you are dying 
often in the early game as it greatly speeds up the birth process.

The Race/Class Screen
On this screen, you can change your race, class and possibly your 
personality. The screen will look something like the following:

Name : Fatty Bolger        
Sex  : Male                 STR  INT  WIS  DEX  CON  CHR  Life  BHP  Exp
Race : Hobbit                -2   +1   +1   +3   +2   +1   92%  +14  120%

  c) Change Class              ESC) Prev Screen
  m) Change Magic             
                              
Tip: You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter
     for a command. For example, type R on this screen to receive help
     on your currently selected race.

So, what do we see? First, the fields in blue are those that you may 
change on this screen. You will notice that the game picked a starting 
race and class for you to play, but you probably want to change that 
(The default is for new players so they can just accept the defaults 
and experiment with playing a reasonably well chosen character).

Next, to the right is a table displaying information about the stats 
and skills of your current race, class and personality. Every character 
has six basic attributes, called stats, that are very important to game 
play. Indeed, a large portion of the game involves increasing your 
character's stats so that they can fight better, or cast more powerful 
spells, etc. Your six basic stats are: Strength (STR), Intelligence 
(INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON) and Charisma 
(CHR). See [b] below for more info. Your character's spell stat, if 
any, is displayed in violet. This is a very important stat for magical 
classes, since it determines how well the character can cast spells. 
Normally you want this as high as possible. For melee characters, 
you'll want to also have high strength and dexterity.

On the next screen, you will choose the starting stats for this 
character, and the values you choose will be modified by the amount 
shown in the table. The bottom row in the table is the total row, 
showing you a nice summary of the cummulative effects of your various 
birth choices. It is the value in this row that gets added to your 
starting stats.

Other fields in the table include:
  Life: Short for Life Rating, this value determines how many hit 
        points your player will get. Hit points are also affected by 
        your constitution, although the amount isn't really noticeable 
        until later in the game (Hint: Don't worry too much about your 
        starting constitution). By the way, hit points are your 
        player's health. If your hit points go below zero, you die!
  BHP:  Short for Base Hit Points, this value is added to your starting 
        hit points to make the early game easier.
  Exp:  Short for Experience Factor, this percentage determines how 
        quickly or slowly your character gains new levels (All players 
        begin at level 1 and may advance up to level 50. Increasing 
        your level gives more hit points, better skills, access to more 
        powerful spells, and various other effects and bonuses).

In addition to stats, your player also has skills (see [c] below). For 
example, your Melee skill determines your ability to hit monsters in 
hand to hand combat. Like stats, these skills are also affected by your 
birth options, and are displayed in the information table on this and 
the next screen. But, since your screen is only so wide, you'll need to 
use the TAB key:

Name : Fatty Bolger        
Sex  : Male                 Disarming  Device     Save       Stealth
Race : Hobbit               Superb     Excellent  Excellent  Excellent 
Class: Rogue                Superb     Excellent  Fair       Excellent 
Magic: Burglary             Superb     Superb     Very Good  Superb    

And TAB again:

Name : Fatty Bolger        
Sex  : Male                 Searching  Perception Melee      Bows
Race : Hobbit               Superb     Heroic     Very Bad   Superb    
Class: Rogue                Good       Fair       Excellent  Excellent 
Magic: Burglary             Excellent  Very Good  Excellent  Superb    

Ah, we see that hobbits aren't so good at melee. However, for this 
particular skill, your class choice has a much greater influence than 
your racial choice, and we can tell from the total line that this 
character's melee skill won't be so bad after all.

Below the player fields and the information table is a list of commands 
that you may choose. These commands might bring up a menu of choices 
for you to select from, as, for example, the Change Race command:

Name : Fatty Bolger        
Sex  : Male                 STR  INT  WIS  DEX  CON  CHR  Life  BHP  Exp
Race : Hobbit                -2   +1   +1   +3   +2   +1   92%  +14  120%
Class: Rogue                 +2   +1   -1   +3   +1   +1  110%  +12  125%
Magic: Burglary              +0   +2   +0   +6   +3   +2  101%  +26  150%
                           
Choose Your Race
  a) Human                       e) Dunadan
  b) Dwarf                       f) High-Elf
  c) Hobbit                      g) Half-Troll
  d) Gnome                       *) Random
                              
     Use SHIFT+choice to display help topic

Aternatively, the command might take effect immediately, as with the 
Change Sex command. Or, if you use the Change Name command, you can 
edit your character's name directly in place:

Name : Fatty Bolger        
Sex  : Male                 STR  INT  WIS  DEX  CON  CHR  Life  BHP  Exp

  m) Change Magic             
                              
Tip: You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter
     for a command. For example, type R on this screen to receive help
     on your currently selected race.

When you are happy with your character choices, press RET to move on to 
the next screen. You can always ESC to back up and make changes, so 
don't worry too much about getting things perfect the first time 
through.

The Stats Screen
On this screen, you enter your starting stats. Unlike previous 
versions, you no longer roll for random starting stats; nor is there an 
auto-roller. Instead, the game now uses a point based system where each 
stat that you enter gets charged a given amount, and you only have so 
many points to spend overall (currently, just 30). By default, the game 
tries to guess a reasonable allocation, and if you are a new player, 
you might just want to use the defaults.

Here is a sample screen:

Name : Fatty Bolger        
Sex  : Male                 STR  INT  WIS  DEX  CON  CHR  Life  BHP  Exp
Race : Hobbit                -2   +1   +1   +3   +2   +1   92%  +14  120%
Class: Rogue                 +2   +1   -1   +3   +1   +1  110%  +12  125%
Magic: Burglary              +0   +2   +0   +6   +3   +2  101%  +26  150%

w/W) WIS    9   -2   +0      9   TAB) More Info
d/D) DEX   16   10   +6  18/40   RET) Begin Play
c/C) CON   14    3   +3     17   ESC) Prev Screen
r/R) CHR   10   -1   +2     12  
                30              
                                
Note: You may adjust each starting stat using the indicated keys. The
      lower case key decrements while the upper case increments the
      starting value. Values may range from 8 to 17 and each value that
      you enter is charged the indicated number of points. You only
      have 30 points to spend so be sure to adjust those stats that
      matter most.

Follow the instructions to make changes. If your point total exceeds 
30, the option to begin playing will be disabled until you decrease 
your overall score. When you are ready, press RET to begin playing!

Where to Go from Here?
You can begin playing at this point. Use the help system (?) to learn 
the basic commands. Alternatively, you may wish to read the [d] Newbie 
Guide next. It contains a brief tutorial to help get you started.

Character Attributes
Once you begin character generation you will be asked to choose your 
character's four primary attributes: sex, race, class and personality. 
If you have selected a spellcasting class, you will also be prompted 
for your choice of magic realm(s). Your character's sex has almost no 
effect on game play. More details of attributes are found in the Races, 
Classes and Personalities section (see [e]) and the Magic System 
section (see [f]).

In addition to these attributes, there are several statistics which are 
used to determine your character's relative skills and abilities as 
follows:

  Primary Statistics
  Each character has six primary statistics or 'stats'. These are 
  strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma, 
  and they modify the abilities of the character in a variety of ways. 
  For example, strength affects your carrying capacity, the amount of 
  damage you do to a monster when you hit it and the number of blows 
  per round you get with a weapon. A more complete discussion of the 
  primary statistics is contained later in this document (see [g] 
  below).
  
  Experience
  Experience affects almost everything else about your character. 
  Experience can be gained as your character kills monsters, casts 
  spells for the first time, learns about an object kind by using it, 
  disarms traps and unlocks doors. Certain classes may also gain 
  experience by destroying specific dungeon spell books and there are 
  potions in the dungeon that will boost your experience if you quaff 
  them.
  
  When your character's experience crosses certain fixed boundaries, 
  you will attain a new experience level (up to a maximum of 50). When 
  this happens, your hitpoints, mana (if any), certain skills such as 
  melee fighting and bows and throws will all increase. Some races and 
  classes will also gain new powers and abilities when crossing certain 
  experience thresholds.
  
  Deep down inside, the real objective of the game is to increase your 
  experience, and certain other characteristics, and also to collect 
  useful items, to give you a decent chance against the dreaded 
  Morgoth. Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus your 
  level, which will cause you to lose all of the effects of the higher 
  level. Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical 
  means, or by simply regaining the experience all over again.
  
  Gold (Au)
  Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items and 
  services from the shops and other buildings on the town level. Gold 
  can be obtained by selling items to the shops, taking it from the 
  corpses of dead monsters, mining it and by finding it lying on the 
  dungeon floor.
  
  Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which is 
  random. Each character also starts out with a few useful items, which 
  may be kept, or sold to a shop-keeper for more gold.
  
  Hit Points (HP)
  Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the 
  character can sustain before he dies. Your hit points are derived 
  from your race, class, level, and constitution, and can be boosted by 
  magical means. Hit points may be regained by resting, or by a variety 
  of magical means.
  
  Spell Points (Mana)
  Many characters have spell points, or mana, which represents how many 
  spells a character can cast. Your spell points (sometimes called 
  mana) are derived from your class, level, the primary spell stat of 
  your class, and the race modifier of that stat. Spell points may be 
  regained by resting, or by a few magical means.
  
  Character Skills
  Each character also has several primary skills: disarming, magic 
  devices, saving throws, stealth, searching, perception, melee and 
  bows and throws, which are derived from the character's race, class, 
  experience level, stats and their current equipment. These skills 
  have fairly obvious effects, but will be described more completely 
  below. The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and 
  class. Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may 
  increase with the level of the character (see [h] below for details).
  
  Speed
  Speed is arguably the most important attribute of any character. In 
  the beginning, you, and most monsters, will move at Normal speed. 
  However, occasionally you will see a monster that is moving very 
  fast, taking multiple actions for each of yours. That monster is Fast 
  and has quite an advantage. Indeed, were it smart, it could nip you 
  on your heels (I'm imagining one of Farmer Maggot's dogs to be 
  concrete), and then back away before you could strike! Wouldn't you 
  love to be able to do the same?
  
  To increase your player's speed, you will generally need magic, 
  either in the form of a spell or potion, or in the form of an 
  enchanted piece of equipment (such as Boots of Speed). Potions of 
  Speed will serve the early player well, and you should use them 
  liberally against foes that seem too powerful otherwise (especially 
  those pesky uniques). They are quite common. As you dive deeper, 
  increasing your speed becomes more and more important as the monsters 
  become more and more deadly. A slow player with lots of hitpoints can 
  still die without getting a single action if they are slow and their 
  opponent is fast.
  
Primary Statistics
Each character has six primary stats (strength, intelligence, wisdom, 
dexterity, constitution, and charisma) which modify the abilities of 
the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value, 
ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even 
higher, into the percentile range, represented as 18/01 through 18/220, 
the maximal value which is generally displayed as 18/***.

During the birth process, you will choose your starting stat values. It 
is very important that you pick good values in the key areas that your 
player intends to exploit. For example, if you are creating a mage, 
then you will want to make sure that your Intelligence is as high as 
possible. For a warrior, focus on Strength and Dexterity instead. You 
can't have it all, so you will need to balance good stats with bad 
stats.

As you play the game, your stats can be increased through magical 
means, or as a reward for accomplishing a difficult task, or as a 
reward for gaining enough experience to advance to a key level. 
Eventually, your stats will reach their internal maximum value, which 
is a value between 18/70 and 18/130 and which is randomly chosen at 
your player's birth. At this point, it will be up to your racial and 
class modifiers, and your equipment to boost your stats further up to 
the 18/*** limit.

  Strength (STR)
  Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee combat and with 
  missile weapons. A high strength will improve your chances of getting 
  multiple blows with your melee weapon and, in addition, will 
  dramatically increase the amount of damage done with each hit. 
  Strength also has a marginal effect on your chance to hit your 
  opponent. Characters with low strength may receive penalties. 
  Strength is also useful in tunneling, bashing and in carrying heavy 
  items without being slowed down.

  Intelligence (INT)
  Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like 
  spellcasters (high mages, mages, warrior-mages, chaos-warriors and 
  rogues). Intelligence will affect the number of spells these classes 
  may learn each level, the number of spell points they receive and 
  their spell fail rates. These classes cannot learn spells if their 
  intelligence is 7 or lower. Also, intelligent characters are better 
  at using magic devices, picking locks and disarming traps. Finally, 
  intelligence influences how quickly all characters learn from their 
  experiences.

  Wisdom (WIS)
  Wisdom affects the ability of priest-like spellcasters (priests, 
  paladins and monks) to use prayers. WIS will affect the number of 
  spells these classes may learn each level, the number of spell points 
  they receive and their spell fail rates. In addition, WIS is also 
  used to determine a Mindcrafter's ability to use his or her mental 
  powers. These classes cannot learn spells if their wisdom is 7 or 
  lower. Wise character's will have better chances of resisting magical 
  spells cast upon them by monsters. Wisdom also affects the player's 
  awareness of their surroundings, granting faster or slower pseudo-id 
  and level feelings.

  Dexterity (DEX)
  Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high dexterity 
  may allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter weapons, 
  thus greatly increasing his kill power, and will increase his chances 
  of hitting with any weapon and dodging blows from enemies. Dexterity 
  is also useful in picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting 
  yourself from some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons.

  Constitution (CON)
  Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his body, 
  and to recover from damage received. Therefore a character with a 
  high constitution will receive more hit points and also recover them 
  faster while resting.

  Charisma (CHR)
  Charisma represents a character's personality and force of will. A 
  character with a high charisma will be better able to dominate foes 
  and pets. Also, charisma is the primary stat used for determining 
  player and monster fear. A low charisma player is often frightened, 
  sometimes even to the point of paralysis! A high charisma player can 
  more easily break the morale of their foes. In this game, fear is a 
  very important and deadly component of gameplay. As such, charisma is 
  a very important stat. Finally, some classes (Bards, Sorcerers, etc) 
  use Charisma as their primary spell stat.

Primary Skills
Characters possess some different abilities which can help them to 
survive. The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and 
class. Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase 
with the level of the character.

  Melee
  Melee is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists. 
  Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but if his 
  dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive more blows per 
  round with lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both modify the 
  ability to hit an opponent. This skill increases with the level of 
  the character.

  Bows and Throws
  Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in 
  this skill. Different stats apply to different weapons, but this 
  ability may modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the amount 
  of damage done, and the ability to hit a creature. This skill 
  increases with the level of the character.

  Saving Throws
  A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects of 
  a spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not include 
  spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as quaffing a 
  nasty potion. This ability increases with the level of the character, 
  but then most high level creatures are better at casting spells, so 
  it tends to even out. A high wisdom also increases this ability.

  Stealth
  The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with 
  good stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first 
  blow. Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy character 
  entirely, allowing a player to avoid certain fights. This skill is 
  based entirely upon race and class, and will never improve unless 
  magically enhanced.

  Disarming
  Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and includes 
  picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming will gain 
  the character some experience. A trap must be found before it can be 
  disarmed. Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to 
  disarm, and this ability increases with the level of the character.

  Magical Devices
  Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires experience 
  and knowledge. Spell users such as magi and priests are therefore 
  much better at using a magical device than say a warrior. This skill 
  is modified by intelligence, and increases with the level of the 
  character.

  Perception (Searching Frequency)
  Perception is the ability to notice something without actively 
  seeking it out. This skill is based entirely upon race and class, and 
  will never improve unless magically enhanced.

  Searching (Searching Ability)
  To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps, and 
  traps on chests. Rogues are the best at searching, but magi, rangers, 
  and priests are also good at it. This skill is based entirely upon 
  race and class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.

  Infravision
  Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the 
  dungeon is cool or cold, infravision will not allow the player to see 
  walls and objects. Infravision will allow a character to see any 
  warm-blooded creatures up to a certain distance. This ability works 
  equally well with or with out a light source. The majority of 
  monsters are cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by 
  a light source. Most non-human races have innate infravision ability. 
  Humans can gain infravision only if it is magically enhanced.

  Noctovision
  Noctovision is a rare ability to see without the use of any 
  lightsource. Normally restricted to undead races and the ninja (an 
  assassin that hides in shadows), this ability is not available to 
  most players. The range of this ability is limited in many cases, but 
  ninjas and all of the monster mode races with this ability have no 
  range restriction. With one evil exception, this ability cannot be 
  magically enhanced.

Proficiency Levels
In PosChengband, characters possess different proficiency levels or 
experiences for each weapon type, spells, and a few other skills. The 
starting proficiency levels and the maximum proficiency levels of a 
character are based upon class. Each proficiency level may increase 
when you practice with it, and can be checked by the 'Check various 
information' command (~).

For weapon proficiency, you need to hit monsters many times with a 
weapon of that type to practice. And your to-hit bonus of the weapon 
will increases with the proficiency level of it. The rate of increase 
is dependent upon the level of the character and the level of the 
opponents.

For spell proficiency, you need to cast the spell many times in a deep 
level of the dungeon to practice. However, simply casting the spell 
repeatedly for no purpose other than gaining experience will not work. 
Rather, the game detects this "spamming" so you really should practice 
spells out in the real world, not sequestered in some safe corner of 
the dungeon. Finally, the fail-rate and mana consumption rate of the 
spell decreases when the proficiency level increases.

The effect of the proficiency level of the Dual Wielding and the 
Martial Arts is almost same as the weapon proficiency; These will 
effect upon your to-hit bonus of dual wielding combat or bare handed 
combat.

For the proficiency level of the Riding, you need to attack in melee or 
shoot with missile weapon when riding. And your speed increases up to 
the mount's speed when the proficiency level increases. (see [i])

Birth Options
During character generation you may press '=' at any time to access the 
birth options. A more detailed description of the various birth options 
can be found in the section on the Options Page (see [j]). Feel free to 
ignore these options if you are new to the game. In fact, if you chose 
the Beginner startup option as suggested, then the birth options won't 
even be displayed to you (i.e., you will play with the default 
options).

Reference

Beginner Mode  Designed for new players, this mode greatly restricts 
               the races and classes available to the player. In 
               addition, it removes Personality from the birth process, 
               forcing the player to play with the Ordinary personality 
               (which has absolutely no gameplay effects). Also, the 
               player is unable to enter birth options (=) and must 
               play with the default options (Too much to confuse new 
               players otherwise).

Normal Mode    This is the standard way to play: the Full Monty, so to 
               speak. All races and classes are available to choose 
               from, even ones that might be under development and not 
               yet fully tested. The player has access to both the 
               Birth Options and the Personality subsystem.

Monster Mode   This mode allows the player to play as a monster rather 
               than a normal character. There is no class to choose 
               (The game forces a special Monster class that has 
               absolutely no gameplay effects). Instead, the racial 
               (and subracial) choices determine the type of monster to 
               play. There are many options to choose from. Most monter 
               forms evolve from weak forms to stronger ones (e.g. from 
               a Forest Troll to a Fire Troll, and so forth) and many 
               forms have unique body types (e.g. a Xorn has two full 
               sets of arms and can wield up to four weapons in melee). 
               In addition, most monster races have a boss who will 
               drop a nifty artifact when slain. But the goal of the 
               game remains the same: kill Morgoth, Lord of Darkness.

Quick Start    Once an existing character dies you may create a new one 
               from the same savefile. If so, you will be asked whether 
               you want to use quick start or not at start up. If you 
               choose to use quick start, you get a new character with 
               exactly the same race, class, stats, and personality as 
               your last character. Since it is common to die early on, 
               this option can save you the tedium of re-rolling a new 
               character from scratch.

Character Name During the birth process, you may change the name of 
               your character. This name will be used for your savefile 
               (unless you created this character inside an existing, 
               already named savefile) and any options and preferences 
               you may set. So choose your name carefully. You may 
               rename an existing character using the ~n command.
