The Races
There are many races in the world, each, for the most part, with both 
strengths and weaknesses. Humans are the base race, and serve as the 
benchmark of comparison for all the others. In general, the stronger a 
race is relative to humans, the higher the Experience Penalty and the 
longer it will take to gain levels.

For details on the Primary Statistics, see [a]. For information about 
the various Skills, see [b]. The skill descriptions in this document 
are for comparison purposes only. For example, your fledgling high-elf 
will not be born with Legendary[2] device skill. In general, skills are 
influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. To compare the 
various races, you might want to take a look at [c] the race tables 
below.

Humans
  Amberite
  The Amberites are a reputedly immortal race, who are endowed with 
  numerous advantages in addition to their longevity. They are very 
  tough and their constitution cannot be reduced, and their ability to 
  heal wounds far surpasses that of any other race. Having seen 
  virtually everything, very little is new to them, and they gain 
  levels much slower than the other races.

  Barbarian
  Barbarians are hardy men of the north. They are fierce in combat, and 
  their wrath is feared throughout the world. Combat is their life: 
  they feel no fear, and they learn to enter battle frenzy at will even 
  sooner than half-trolls. Barbarians are, however, suspicious of 
  magic, which makes magic devices fairly hard for them to use.

  Demigod
  The term demigod is commonly used to describe mythological figures 
  whose one parent was a god and whose other parent was human; as such, 
  demigods are human-god hybrids and are quite powerful. Demigods 
  receive special abilities depending on their parentage.
  
  See [d] for more details on demigod parentage.

  Dunadan
  Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West. This elder race 
  surpasses human abilities in every field, especially constitution. 
  However, being men of the world, very little is new to them, and 
  levels are very hard for them to gain. Their constitution cannot be 
  reduced.

  Human
  The human is the base character. All other races are compared to 
  them. Humans are average at everything and also tend to go up levels 
  faster than most other races because of their shorter life spans. No 
  racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human. 
  However, humans may choose special talents at L20 & 40 that more than 
  make up for their overall mediocrity.

Elves
  Dark-Elf
  Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by darkness 
  attacks, the Dark Elves have a long tradition and knowledge of magic. 
  They have an inherent magic missile attack available to them at a low 
  level. With their keen sight, they also learn to see invisible things 
  as their relatives High-Elves do, but at a higher level.

  High-Elf
  High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of 
  time. They are masters of all skills, and are strong and intelligent, 
  although their wisdom is sometimes suspect. High-elves begin their 
  lives able to see the unseen, and resist light effects just like 
  regular elves. However, there are few things that they have not seen 
  already, and experience is very hard for them to gain.

  Wood-Elf
  Wood-Elves are the most common of elves. They prefer the seclusion of 
  thick forests and are unhampered when moving through dense foliage. 
  Their skills with tracking and bow are unsurpassed, and as they 
  advance they gain the power of Nature Awareness.

Hobbits/Dwarves
  Dwarf
  Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Dwarves 
  tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than 
  humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise, they 
  resist spells which are cast on them. They are very good at 
  searching, perception, fighting, and bows. Dwarves have miserable 
  stealth. They resist being blinded.

  Gnome
  Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than Halflings. They, like 
  the hobbits, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make 
  excellent mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at 
  searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower 
  strength than humans so they are not very good at fighting with hand 
  weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so they can detect 
  warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Gnomes are intrinsically 
  protected against paralysis.

  Hobbit
  Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have good 
  saving throws. They also are very good at searching, disarming, 
  perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to 
  be called burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good at 
  melee fighting. Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect 
  warm creatures at a distance.

  Nibelung
  The hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these 
  cave-dwellers are not much bothered by darkness. Their natural 
  inclination to magical items has made them resistant to effects which 
  could disenchant magical energy.

Fairies
  Shadow-Fairy
  Shadow Fairies are one of the several fairy races. They have wings, 
  and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them. Shadow Fairies 
  must beware of sunlight, as they are vulnerable to bright light. They 
  are physically weak, but have advantages in using magic and are 
  amazingly stealthy. Shadow Fairies have a wonderful advantage in that 
  they never aggravate monsters (If their equipment normally aggravates 
  monsters, they only suffer a penalty to stealth, but if they 
  aggravate by their personality itself, the advantage will be lost).

  Sprite
  One of the several fairy races, Sprites are very small. They have 
  tiny wings and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them. They 
  enjoy sunlight intensely, and need worry little about light based 
  attacks. Although physically among the weakest races, Sprites are 
  very talented in magic, and can become highly skilled wizards. 
  Sprites have the special power of spraying Sleeping Dust, and at 
  higher levels they learn to fly faster.

Angels/Demons
  Archon
  Archons are a higher class of angels. They are good at all skills, 
  and are strong, wise, and are a favorite with any people. They are 
  able to see the unseen, and their wings allow them to safely fly over 
  traps and other dangerous places. However, belonging to a higher 
  plane as they do, the experiences of this world do not leave a strong 
  impression on them and they gain levels slowly.

  Balrog
  Balrogs are a higher class of demons. They are strong, intelligent 
  and tough. They do not believe in gods, and are not suitable for 
  priest at all. Balrog are resistant to fire and nether, and have a 
  firm hold on their life force. They also eventually learn to see 
  invisible things. They are good at almost all skills except stealth. 
  They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, and need 
  human corpses as sacrifices to regain their vitality.

  Imp
  A demon-creature from the nether-world, naturally resistant to fire

Orcs/Trolls/Giants
  Cyclops
  With but one eye, a Cyclops can see more than many with two eyes. 
  They are headstrong, and loud noises bother them very little. They 
  are not quite qualified for the magic using professions, but as a 
  certain Mr. Ulysses can testify, their accuracy with thrown rocks can 
  be deadly!

  Half-Giant
  Half-Giants limited intelligence makes it difficult for them to 
  become full spellcasters, but with their huge strength they make 
  excellent warriors. Their thick skin makes them resistant to shards, 
  and like Half-Trolls, they have their strength sustained.

  Ogres are big and ugly but possessed of a low cunning and great 
  strength. For warriors, they have all the necessary attributes, and 
  they can even become wizards: after all, they are related to Ogre 
  Magi, from whom they have learned the skill of setting trapped runes 
  once their level is high enough. Being simple minded they have their 
  intelligence sustained

  Half-Orc
  Half - orcs make excellent warriors, but are terrible at magic. They 
  are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching, 
  disarming, and perception. Half - orcs are quite ugly, and tend to 
  pay more for goods in town. Because of their preference to living 
  underground to on the surface, half - orcs resist darkness attacks. 
  The human part of their heritage allows them to select a talent at 
  Level 30.

  Half-Titan
  Half-mortal descendants of the mighty titans, these immensely 
  powerful creatures put almost any other race to shame. They may lack 
  the fascinating special powers of certain other races, but their 
  enhanced attributes more than make up for that. They learn to 
  estimate the strengths of their foes, and their love for law and 
  order makes them resistant to the effects of Chaos.

  Half-Troll
  Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than most 
  other races. They are also very stupid and slow. They are bad at 
  searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that 
  a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. They also happen to be fun to 
  run... Half-trolls always have their strength sustained. Half-Trolls 
  regenerate wounds automatically.

  Kobold
  Kobolds are a weak goblin race. They love poisoned weapons, and can 
  learn to throw poisoned darts (of which they carry an unlimited 
  supply). They are also inherently resistant to poison, although they 
  are not one of the more powerful races.

  Snotling
  Snotlings are greenskins, and are cousins of Goblins and Orcs, 
  smaller than the former and dumber than the latter, often used by 
  them as cannon fodder, food or even cannon missiles. They are on the 
  lowest rung of greenskin society and are bullied by all. Snotlings 
  often wield mushrooms or sticks into battle.

The Undead
  Skeleton
  There are two types of skeletons: the ordinary, warrior-like 
  skeletons, and the spell-using skeletons, which are also called 
  liches. As undead beings, skeletons need to worry very little about 
  poison or attacks that can drain life. They do not really use eyes 
  for perceiving things, and are thus not fooled by invisibility. Their 
  bones are resistant to sharp shrapnel, and they will quickly become 
  resistant to cold. Although the magical effects of these will affect 
  the skeleton even without entering the skeleton's (non-existent) 
  belly, the potion or food itself will fall through the skeleton's 
  jaws, giving no nutritional benefit. They can absorb mana from staves 
  and wands as their energy source.

  Spectre
  Another powerful undead creature: the Spectre is a ghastly 
  apparition, surrounded by an unearthly green glow. They exist only 
  partially on our plane of existence: half-corporeal, they can pass 
  through walls, although the density of the wall will hurt them in the 
  process of doing this. As undead, they have a firm hold on their life 
  force, see invisible, and resist poison and cold. They also resist 
  nether. Spectres make superb spellcasters, but their physical form is 
  very weak. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, 
  but can absorb mana from staves and wands as their energy source.

  Vampire
  One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an awe-inspiring 
  sight. Yet this dread creature has a serious weakness: the bright 
  rays of sun are its bane, and it will need to flee the surface to the 
  deep recesses of earth until the sun finally sets. Darkness, on the 
  other hand, only makes the Vampire stronger. As undead, the Vampire 
  has a firm hold on its life force, and resists nether attacks. The 
  Vampire also resists cold and poison based attacks. It is, however, 
  susceptible to its perpetual hunger for fresh blood, which can only 
  be satiated by sucking the blood from a nearby monster.

  Zombie
  Zombies are undead horrors, resistant to life draining and the forces 
  of the netherworld. The grave is cold but this does not bother the 
  undead and poison scarcely affects the unliving. Zombies gain little 
  nutrition from ordinary food. Instead, they must absorb mana from 
  magical devices to maintain their undead existence.

Other Races
  Android
  An android is a artificial creation with a body of machinery. Over 
  the millenia, artificial intelligence has improved to the point where 
  androids are nearly as smart as humans, though perhaps not so wise. 
  Of course, their mechanical body offers great physical advantages, 
  far surpassing the powers of man. Androids don't acquire experience 
  like other races, but rather gain in power as they attach new 
  equipment to their frame. Rings, amulets, and lights do not influence 
  growth. Androids are resistant to poison, can move freely, and are 
  immune to life-draining attacks. Moreover, because of their hard 
  metallic bodies, they get a bonus to AC. Androids have electronic 
  circuits throughout their body and must beware of electric shocks. 
  They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but they 
  can use flasks of oil as their energy source.

  Beastman
  This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos. It is not 
  an independent race but rather a humanoid creature, most often a 
  human, twisted by the Chaos, or a nightmarish crossbreed of a human 
  and a beast. All Beastmen are accustomed to Chaos so much that they 
  are untroubled by confusion and sound, although raw logrus can still 
  have effects on them. Beastmen revel in chaos, as it twists them more 
  and more. Beastmen are subject to mutations: when they have been 
  created, they receive a random mutation. After that, every time they 
  advance a level they have a small chance of gaining yet another 
  mutation.

  Centaur
  Centaurs are creatures with the head, arms and torso of a human 
  combined with the body and legs of a horse. As such, they are able to 
  move more quickly as they gain experience and are capable of leaping 
  great distances. They may attack monsters with their hooves in 
  addition to any normal melee weapons. Centaurs are strong, agile, and 
  wise, but not so smart. They are skilled in fighting and archery but 
  are rather distrustful of magic. Finally, being at home in the 
  forests of the world, Centaurs are able to move quickly through 
  foliage.

  Draconians are a humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. There are 
  several subtypes of draconians with different resistances, breaths 
  and attributes. For example, Red Draconians are resistant to fire 
  which they may also breathe at will, while White Draconians breathe 
  and resist cold instead. All draconians levitate. In addition, when 
  they mature enough, they may choose a special draconian power.

  to fire. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, 
  but they can absorb water from potions as their nutrition. Finally, 
  they can summon the trees of the forest to their side.

  Golem
  A Golem is an artificial creature, built from a lifeless raw material 
  like clay, and awakened to life. They are nearly mindless, making 
  them useless for professions which rely on magic, but as warriors 
  they are very tough. They are resistant to poison, they can see 
  invisible things, and move freely. At higher levels, they also become 
  resistant to attacks which threaten to drain away their life force. 
  Golems gain very little nutrition from ordinary food, but can absorb 
  mana from staves and wands as their power source. Golems also gain a 
  natural armor class bonus from their tough body. Golems become slower 
  with age.

  Klackon

  They make great fighters, but their mental abilities are severely 
  limited. Obedient and well-ordered, they are resistant to confusion. 
  They are also very nimble, and become faster as they advance levels. 
  They are also very acidic, inherently resisting acid, and capable of 
  spitting acid at higher levels.

  'kuta' means 'absentmindedly' or 'vacantly'. Their absentmindedness 
  hurts their searching and perception skills, but renders them 
  resistant to being confused. Their unearthly calmness and serenity 
  make them among the most stealthy of any race. Kutars, although 
  expressionless, are beautiful and so have a high charisma. Members of 
  this race can learn to expand their body horizontally. This increases 
  armour class, but renders them vulnerable to magical attacks.

  Mindflayer
  Mindflayers are a secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their 
  civilization may well be older than any other on our planet, and 
  their intelligence and wisdom are naturally sustained, and are so 
  great that they enable Mindflayers to become more powerful 
  spellcasters than any other race, even if their physical attributes 
  are a good deal less admirable. As they advance levels, they gain the 
  powers of See Invisible and Telepathy.

  Tonberry
  Tonberries are lizard-like creatures who possess enormous strength 
  and have a preference for cleavers and large knives. They are, 
  however, sluggish in their movements and reactions; young and 
  inexperienced tonberries are often preyed on by the other races. They 
  possess human-like intelligence, but rarely become mages due to their 
  culture and physiology. Tonberries attack very powerfully in melee, 
  albeit with fewer attacks than normal. They are also easily confused 
  and move with reduced speed.

  Yeek
  Yeeks are among the most pathetic creatures. Fortunately, their 
  horrible screams can scare away less confident foes, and their skin 
  becomes more and more resistant to acid, as they gain experience. But 
  having said that, even a mediocre monster can wipe the proverbial 
  floor with an unwary Yeek.
