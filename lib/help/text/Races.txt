The Races
There are many races in the world, each, for the most part, with both 
strengths and weaknesses. In general, the stronger a race is, the 
higher its Experience Penalty and the longer it will take to gain 
levels.

For details on the Stats, see [a]. For information about the Skills, 
see [b]. The skill descriptions in this document are for comparison 
purposes only; they will tell you how good a race is compared to other 
races, but should not be taken as a literal indicator of the skill 
level your fledgling character will be born with. In general, skills 
are influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. See the race 
tables [c] below for a quick comparison of the various races.

Humans
  Amberite
  The Amberites are a reputedly immortal race, who are endowed with 
  numerous advantages in addition to their longevity. They are very 
  tough and their constitution cannot be reduced, and their ability to 
  recover from wounds surpasses most other races. Having seen virtually 
  everything, very little is new to them, and so they gain levels 
  relatively slowly.

  Barbarian
  Barbarians are hardy men of the north; they are fierce in combat, and 
  their wrath is feared throughout the world. Combat is their life: 
  they feel no fear, and they learn to enter battle frenzy at will even 
  sooner than half-trolls. Barbarians are, however, suspicious of 
  magic, which makes magic devices fairly hard for them to use. 
  Barbarians gain a demigod talent at level 30.

  Demigod
  The term demigod is commonly used to describe mythological figures 
  whose one parent was a god and whose other parent was human; as such, 
  demigods are human-god hybrids and are quite powerful. Demigods 
  receive special abilities depending on their parentage.
  
  See [d] for more details on demigod parentage.

  Dunadan
  Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West. This elder race 
  surpasses human abilities in every field; however, being men of the 
  world, very little is new to them, and levels are very hard for them 
  to gain. Dunedain gain one demigod talent at level 30. Their 
  constitution is exceptionally good and cannot be reduced.

  Human
  Humans are average at everything, and tend to gain levels rapidly due 
  to their short life spans. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur 
  to characters choosing human. However, humans may select special 
  talents at levels 20 and 40 that more than make up for their apparent 
  mediocrity.

  Igor
  The epitome of a self-made man, an Igor is generally easily 
  recognizable by the ring of stitches around his neck, the tendency to 
  limp with perfectly healthy legs, and the mysterious ability to 
  appear suddenly and then disappear when the mob comes looking. An 
  Igor is at home with lightning, and always carries a bag full of ice 
  in case he should find something that needs to be kept cold.

Elves
  Dark-Elf
  A cave-dwelling race unhampered by darkness attacks, dark-elves have 
  more in common with Nibelungs than with other elves. They have a 
  great capacity for magic and spellcasting, and learn the Magic 
  Missile spell at a low level regardless of their class. With their 
  keen sight, they soon acquire the ability to see invisible things.

  High-Elf
  High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of 
  time. They are masters of all skills, and are strong and intelligent, 
  although their wisdom is sometimes suspect. High-elves begin their 
  lives able to see the unseen, and resist light effects just like 
  regular elves. However, there are few things that they have not seen 
  already, so new levels are quite hard for them to gain.

  Tomte
  Smaller and of lighter build than regular elves, Tomtes are nimble, 
  intelligent, extremely stealthy and at home with magical devices, but 
  their size handicaps them in physical combat. They greatly prefer 
  light headwear, and cannot think clearly with a heavy helmet 
  squeezing their brains. Tomtes have the ability to sense monsters and 
  items at a glance (they gain auto-identify at level 40); and being 
  accustomed to long winters, they are not much bothered by cold.

  Wood-Elf
  Wood-Elves are the most common of elves. They prefer the seclusion of 
  thick forests and are unhampered when moving through dense foliage. 
  Their skills with tracking and bow are unsurpassed, and as they 
  advance they gain the power of Nature Awareness.

Hobbits/Dwarves
  Dwarf
  Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. They tend 
  to be strong and tough, but lack agility. Because they are so 
  headstrong and also somewhat wise, dwarves are relatively resistant 
  to evil curses cast on them. They are very good at fighting, 
  searching and perception, and resist being blinded, but infamously 
  have miserable stealth.

  Gnome
  Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than hobbits; and like 
  hobbits, they live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make 
  excellent mages, and have very good saving throws. They are naturally 
  skilled at most things, but not very strong or good at hand-to-hand 
  fighting. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, allowing them to detect 
  warm-blooded creatures at a distance. They are also intrinsically 
  protected against paralysis.

  Hobbit
  Hobbits (or Halflings) have exceptional stealth and are very good at 
  bows and throwing; indeed, they are generally well-suited for the 
  adventuring life. Yet their small size is a handicap at times; they 
  are not very good at melee fighting, and cannot suffer as many hard 
  hits as larger races. Hobbits are known for their love of good 
  cooking, and have an almost miraculous ability to find food in the 
  dark depths of the dungeon.

  Nibelung
  The hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these 
  cave-dwellers are not much bothered by darkness. Their natural 
  inclination to magical items has made them resistant to effects which 
  could disenchant magical energy.

Fairies
  Shadow-Fairy
  Shadow-fairies are one of the several fairy races. They have wings, 
  and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them. Being creatures 
  of darkness, shadow-fairies are vulnerable to bright light. They are 
  physically weak, but naturally adept at using magic. Shadow-fairies 
  are amazingly stealthy, and have a wonderful advantage in that they 
  almost never aggravate monsters; aggravating equipment only gives 
  them a slight penalty to stealth, but if they have an aggravating 
  personality the advantage is lost.

  Sprite
  One of the several fairy races, Sprites are very small. They have 
  tiny wings and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them. They 
  enjoy sunlight intensely, and need worry little about light based 
  attacks. Although physically among the weakest races, Sprites are 
  very talented in magic, and can become highly skilled wizards. 
  Sprites have the special power of spraying Sleeping Dust, and at 
  higher levels they learn to fly faster.

Archons/Demons
  Archon
  Archons are winged humanoids from the Astral Plane. They are good at 
  all skills, and are strong, wise, and a favorite with any people. 
  They are able to see the unseen, and their wings allow them to safely 
  fly over traps and other dangerous places. However, belonging to a 
  higher plane as they do, the experiences of this world do not leave a 
  strong impression on them and they gain levels slowly.

  Balrog
  Balrogs are a higher class of demons. They are strong, intelligent 
  and tough, but lacking in wisdom and not suitable for priesthood. 
  Balrogs are resistant to fire and nether, and have a firm hold on 
  their life force; they also soon learn to see invisible things. They 
  are good at almost all skills except stealth. They gain very little 
  nutrition from the food of mortals, and need human corpses as 
  sacrifices to regain their vitality.

  A demon-creature from the nether-world, naturally resistant to fire

  They are little loved by other races, but can perform fairly well in

  perceive invisible creatures.

Orcs/Trolls/Giants
  Cyclops
  With but one eye, a Cyclops can see more than many with two eyes. 
  They are headstrong, and loud noises bother them very little. They 
  are not quite qualified for the magic using professions, but as a 
  certain Mr. Ulysses can testify, their accuracy with thrown rocks can 
  be deadly!

  Half-Giant
  Half-giants' limited intelligence makes it difficult for them to 
  become full spellcasters, but with their huge strength they make 
  excellent warriors. Their thick skin makes them resistant to shards, 
  and like half-trolls, they have their strength sustained.

  Half-Orc
  Half-orcs make excellent warriors, but are terrible at magic. They 
  are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching, 
  disarming, and perception. Being accustomed to living underground, 
  half-orcs are resistant to darkness attacks. Half-orcs are quite 
  ugly, and so tend to pay more for goods in town. The human part of 
  their heritage allows them to select a talent at level 30.

  Half-Titan
  Half-mortal descendants of the mighty titans, these immensely 
  powerful creatures put almost any other race to shame. They may lack 
  the fascinating special powers some other races have, but their 
  enhanced attributes more than make up for that. They learn to speak 
  words of power to their foes, and their love for law and order makes 
  them resistant to the effects of Chaos.

  Half-Troll
  Half-trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than most 
  other races. They are very stupid, and bad at searching, disarming, 
  perception, and stealth; but they make excellent fighters despite 
  their poor agility. They are so ugly that a half-orc grimaces in 
  their presence. They also happen to be fun to run... Half-trolls 
  always have their strength sustained, and their regeneration is 
  exceptionally fast.

  learn the Ogre Mage skill of setting trapped runes. Being 
  simple-minded, Ogres have their intelligence sustained.

  Snotling

  smaller than the former and dumber than the latter, often used by 
  them as cannon fodder, food or even cannon missiles. They are on the 
  lowest rung of greenskin society and are bullied by all. Snotlings 
  often wield mushrooms or sticks into battle.

Shapeshifters
  Beorning
  Beornings are a hardy, northern race of men, renowned for their 
  ability to assume the shape of a bear. Bear-formed Beornings greatly 
  resemble Berserkers: they are extremely strong in melee and very hard 
  to kill, but incapable of reading scrolls, casting spells or using 
  magical devices. Man-shaped Beornings are still stronger in combat 
  than a regular human, but somewhat lacking in magical skills.
  
  The equipment slots available to a Beorning depend on their shape, 
  and like Werewolves, they carry a special satchel for keeping the 
  items not needed in their current shape.

  Doppelganger
  Doppelgangers are truly pathetic creatures. While nobody has actually 
  ever seen their true form, they are rumored to be small, plain, 
  pathetic creatures. Their one saving grace is the ability to mimic 
  other races.

  Werewolf
  Werewolves are fearsome hunters who can assume either human or wolf 
  shape. They are exceptionally durable in both forms, and have great 
  powers of regeneration, though they are infamously vulnerable to fire 
  and silver, and are not particularly good at using magical spells or 
  devices in either shape. While in wolf form, werewolves wield no 
  weapons; instead, they attack with their teeth and claws. As 
  werewolves wear different equipment in human form and wolf form, they 
  use one inventory slot for a special satchel in which they keep the 
  items not needed in their current shape.

The Undead
  Einheri
  Dead heroes returning to the mortal world for one last fight, 
  Einherjar are highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and start with 
  the ability to enter a battle frenzy; however, they are also passably 
  good at using devices, and do not necessarily make weak magic users. 
  Already having one lifetime's adventures behind them, Einherjar are 
  very strong at the beginning but learn new things slowly. Like other 
  undead races, they are immune to life draining. Einherjar have one 
  serious weakness: magical healing only has a partial effect on them, 
  healing them half as much as it would any other race.

  Skeleton
  As undead beings, skeletons need worry very little about poison or 
  attacks that can drain life. Skeletons do not really use eyes for 
  perceiving things, and are thus not fooled by invisibility. Their 
  bones are resistant to sharp shrapnel, and they will quickly become 
  resistant to cold. Although the magical effects of potions and 
  mushrooms will affect the skeleton even without entering its 
  (non-existent) belly, the food itself will fall through the 
  skeleton's jaws, giving no nutritional benefit; instead, skeletons 
  feed themselves by absorbing the energy of magical devices.

  Spectre
  A powerful undead creature, the Spectre is a ghastly apparition, 
  surrounded by an unearthly green glow. Spectres exist only partially 
  on our plane of existence: half-corporeal, they can pass through 
  walls, although the density of the wall will hurt them in the process 
  of doing this. As undead, they have a firm hold on their life force, 
  can see invisible creatures, and resist poison, cold and nether. 
  Spectres make superb spellcasters, but their physical form is very 
  weak. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but 
  can absorb mana from magical devices as their energy source.

  Vampire
  One of the mightier undead creatures, the vampire is an awe-inspiring 
  sight. Yet this dread creature has a serious weakness: the bright 
  rays of sun are its bane, and it will need to flee the surface to the 
  deep recesses of earth until the sun finally sets. Darkness, on the 
  other hand, holds few terrors to a vampire. Being undead, vampires 
  also resist nether, cold and poison and have a firm hold on their 
  life force; but they are susceptible to a perpetual hunger for fresh 
  blood, which can only be satiated by sucking the blood from a nearby 
  monster.

  Zombie
  Zombies are undead horrors, resistant to life draining and the forces 
  of the netherworld. The grave is cold, but this does not bother the 
  undead, and poison also scarcely affects the unliving. Zombies gain 
  little nutrition from ordinary food; instead, they absorb energy from 
  magical devices to maintain their undead existence.

Other Races
  Android
  An android is an artificial creation with a body of machinery. Their 
  intelligence almost matches that of organic races, though their 
  wisdom is no better than that of Golems. Of course, their mechanical 
  body offers great physical advantages, far surpassing the powers of 
  man. Uniquely among all races, Androids do not acquire experience 
  from killing monsters, but rather gain in power as they attach new 
  equipment to their frame. Rings, amulets, and lights do not influence 
  growth. Androids are resistant to poison and immune to life-draining 
  attacks; moreover, because of their hard metallic bodies, they get a 
  bonus to AC. Androids have electronic circuits throughout their body, 
  and so must beware of electric shocks. They gain very little 
  nutrition from the food of mortals, but can use flasks of oil as 
  their energy source.

  Beastman
  This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos. It is not 
  an independent race but rather a humanoid creature, most often a 
  human, twisted by Chaos; or else a nightmarish crossbreed of a human 
  and a beast. All Beastmen are accustomed to Chaos so much that they 
  are untroubled by confusion and sound, although raw Logrus can still 
  hurt them. Beastmen revel in chaos, as it twists them more and more. 
  Beastmen are subject to mutations: when they have been created, they 
  receive a random mutation, and have a small chance to gain more 
  mutations every time they advance a level. Unlike normal races, 
  Beastmen can have many mutations without ill effects on their 
  regeneration.

  Boit
  Boits are small bipedal creatures covered in yellow, lilac, brown or 
  green fur, distantly related to the Yeeks. Boits move speedily, and 
  can eject the contents of their stomachs at will, but they are not 
  particularly well-suited for melee, ranged combat, use of magical 
  devices, or spellcasting.

  Centaur
  Centaurs are creatures with the head, arms and torso of a human 
  combined with the body and legs of a horse. As such, they are able to 
  move more quickly as they gain experience and are capable of leaping 
  great distances. Centaurs are skilled in fighting and archery and can 
  attack monsters with their hooves in addition to normal melee 
  weapons; but lacking normal feet, they cannot wear boots. Being at 
  home in the forests of the world, Centaurs are able to move quickly 
  through foliage.

  Draconian
  Draconians are a humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. There are 
  several subtypes of draconians with different resistances, breaths 
  and attributes; for example, Red Draconians are resistant to fire 
  which they may also breathe at will, while White Draconians breathe 
  and resist cold instead. All draconians levitate. In addition, when 
  they mature enough, they may choose a special draconian power.
  
  See [e] for more details on draconians.

  Ent
  The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the world, 
  oldest of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda. Spirits of the 
  land, they guard the forests of Middle-earth. Being much like trees, 
  they are strong but very clumsy, and highly susceptible to fire. Ents 
  gain nourishment from drinking water; the food of mortals is of 
  little use to them. Ents have the special ability to summon the trees 
  of the forest to their side.

  Golem
  A Golem is an artificial creature, built from a lifeless raw material 
  like clay, and awakened to life. They are nearly mindless, making 
  them useless for professions which rely on magic, but as warriors 
  they are very tough. They are resistant to poison and paralysis and 
  can see invisible things. At higher levels, they also become 
  resistant to attacks which threaten to drain away their life force. 
  Golems gain very little nutrition from ordinary food, but can absorb 
  mana from staves and wands as their power source. Golems also gain a 
  natural armor class bonus from their tough body. Golems become slower 
  with age.

  Klackon
  Klackons are bizarre semi-intelligent ant-like insectoid creatures. 
  They make great fighters, but their mental abilities are severely 
  limited. Obedient and well-ordered, they are resistant to confusion. 
  They are very nimble, and become faster as they advance levels. They 
  are also very acidic, inherently resist acid, and become capable of 
  spitting it at higher levels.

  Kutar
  A Kutar is not a dog, cat or bear. Despite their characteristic 
  vacant expression, Kutars are beautiful and so have a high charisma. 
  Their absent-mindedness hurts their searching and perception skills, 
  but renders them resistant to being confused. Due to their unearthly 
  calmness and serenity, Kutars are extremely stealthy. They learn the 
  special ability to expand their body horizontally; this increases 
  their armor class, but renders them vulnerable to curses.

  Mindflayer
  Mindflayers are a secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their 
  civilization may well be older than any other; their intelligence and 
  wisdom are naturally sustained, and so great as to make Mindflayers 
  highly effective spellcasters, but their physical attributes are a 
  good deal less admirable. As they gain levels, they learn to see 
  invisible creatures, and eventually develop a telepathic sight.

  Tonberry
  Tonberries are lizard-like creatures who possess enormous strength 
  and have a preference for cleavers and large knives. They are, 
  however, sluggish in their movements and reactions; young and 
  inexperienced tonberries are often preyed on by the other races. They 
  possess human-like intelligence, but rarely become mages due to their 
  culture and physiology. Tonberries attack very powerfully in melee, 
  albeit with fewer attacks than normal. They are also easily confused 
  and move with reduced speed.

  Yeek
  Yeeks are among the most pathetic creatures. Fortunately, their 
  horrible screams can scare away less confident foes, and their skin 
  becomes more and more resistant to acid as they gain experience. They 
  are also fairly good at magic; but in combat, even a mediocre monster 
  can wipe the proverbial floor with an unwary Yeek.

  Icky thing
  Icky things are smallish, slimy, icky, blobby creatures. Theyare 
  despised and ignored by other creatures, this is a blessing 
  indisguise as being ignored means they are stealthy. Icky things are 
  fairly weak overall but their slimy coatings protectthem from poisons 
  and eventually acid.  Icky things a good friendsof molds and other 
  dungeon growths and even allow them to grow onthemselves in a 
  symbiotic relationship (in game turns, they can 'ride'immobile 
  creatures, but in reverse as the icky thing walks aroundinstead of 
  the mount).
