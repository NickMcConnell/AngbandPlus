The Classes

No decision is so important as which class to play. Below, the many 
available classes are loosely grouped by their principal strength or 
playstyle: Melee, Archery, Martial Arts, Magic, Devices, Hybrid, etc. 
The primary spell stat for each class is highlighted.

For details on the Stats, see [a]. For information about the Skills, 
see [b]. The skill descriptions in this document are for comparison 
purposes only; for example, your fledgling berserker will not really be 
born with Amber[25] melee skill. In general, skills are influenced by 
level, race, class, stats and equipment. See the tables at the bottom 
of this file ([c]) to compare the various classes' stat and skill 
boosts at a glance.

Melee
  Berserker
  A Berserker is a fearful fighter indeed, immune to fear and 
  paralysis. At high levels, Berserkers can reflect bolt spells with 
  their tough flesh. Furthermore, they can remove cursed equipment by 
  force, and their special combat techniques are not affected by 
  anti-magic barriers. Berserkers cannot, however, use any magical 
  devices or read any scrolls, and are hopeless at all non-combat 
  skills. To offset these great disadvantages, they gain an important 
  class power - 'Recall' - very early.

  Blood-Knight
  Blood-Knights are fighters who have delved into the dark arts and can 
  perform some special offensive effects using their own health. In 
  addition to the HP cost, using such an ability causes bleeding, with 
  an amount proportional to the cost of the ability. These special 
  abilities rely on Constitution.
   
  Blood-Knights are very unusual in that cuts and low health make them 
  more powerful; at full health their melee is nothing special, but the 
  more damaged and wounded they are, the faster and deadlier their 
  attacks become. On the brink of death they are the strongest fighters 
  imaginable, and stories of their legendary feats abound; but with 
  great power comes great risk of death, and you don't recall ever 
  meeting one of these heroes of legend in person!
   
  Blood-Knights, like Blood-Mages, receive reduced benefits from 
  healing magic. Since a Blood-Knight relies on their own blood for 
  their power, this class is restricted to certain races; no non-living 
  race may walk the red path.

  Duelist
  The duelist is the ultimate one-on-one fighter, but finds himself at 
  a severe disadvantage when facing numerous strong foes at once. To 
  start a duel, the duelist first issues a challenge to his intended 
  foe; of course, this will wake the monster up, as there is no honor 
  in dueling a sleeping enemy! And while the duelist will honor the 
  fight as a one-on-one affair, many monsters have no such scruples.
   
  Against a challenged foe the duelist is extremely strong, gaining 
  bonuses to saving throws, armor class, damage reduction and combat 
  prowess. On the other hand, due to the single-mindedness of their 
  focus, the duelist is quite vulnerable to unchallenged opponents. 
  Most of the special techniques of this class aim at enforcing the 
  sanctity of the duel.
   
  The duelist only ever gains a single attack in combat, but they make 
  the most of this blow by gaining enhanced effects as they gain 
  experience. Able to wound, stun, and even hamstring their foes, the 
  prowess of the duelist in a one-on-one encounter is legendary!
   
  Duelists favor light armors and weapons, and cannot equip a shield. 
  They gain no extra bonus for wielding a weapon with both hands. For 
  their techniques, the duelist relies on Dexterity.

  Mauler
  The Mauler favors extremely heavy weapons, and possesses powerful 
  abilities whose effectiveness depends on the weight of the weapon. 
  While they only gain a limited number of blows which can never be 
  magically increased, they are capable of hitting opponents 
  exceptionally hard to make the most of each strike. Maulers must 
  wield a single weapon with two hands for their talents to function 
  properly.

  Rune-Knight
  The Rune-Knight is a mythical warrior, dedicated to the discovery of 
  ancient runes that hold immense power. They may fix mystical runes of 
  various types to their equipment in order to gain permanent bonuses; 
  even artifacts can be improved this way! Alternatively, they may 
  conjure a temporary rune which allows them to attack with enhanced 
  effects, or place one directly on their person for a one-time or 
  temporary bonus. Finally, they may alter their surroundings with 
  various runes of change.
   
  All runes (except {Absorption}) require mana for creation; however, 
  unlike ordinary spellcasters, Rune-Knights do not regenerate mana on 
  their own. Rather, they must siphon mana from magical or elemental 
  attacks directed against them, and doing so requires the special rune 
  of {Absorption}. This rune should be worn at all times, or at least 
  kept handy.
   
  Despite having mana, the Rune-Knight does not play like an ordinary 
  spellcaster; they are more like a weaponsmith but can, on occasion, 
  cast useful spells. If you have mana available, consider using these 
  spells; otherwise, play as a warrior and wait to absorb mana. This 
  can take time, depending on the foes you face, but the Rune-Knight's 
  honor should prevent them from seeking out weak, defenseless 
  spellcasters; being one of the strongest classes, Rune-Knights have 
  no need to resort to exploits...
  
  See [d] for more details on rune knights.

  Samurai
  Samurai, masters of the art of the blade, are among the strongest 
  fighters and can use various special combat techniques. Samurai are 
  not good at most non-combat skills, and many magical devices in 
  particular may be too difficult for them to use. Wisdom determines a 
  Samurai's ability to use the special combat techniques available.
   
  Samurai use the art of the blade called Kendo (or Bugei). Books of 
  Kendo are similar to spellbooks, but do not need to be carried 
  around; they are only required for studying new combat techniques. 
  Samurai need to wield a weapon to use Kendo, and many of their 
  techniques will add special properties to their blows; these are 
  often slays or brands such as flaming or poisoning, but can be much 
  more powerful than a normal brand. The mana pool of a Samurai does 
  not depend on their level but solely on wisdom; and they can use the 
  class power 'Concentration' to temporarily increase their mana beyond 
  its usual maximum value. The other Samurai class power, 'Assume a 
  Posture', allows them to choose different postures depending on the 
  needs of a situation.

  Warrior
  A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his 
  problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back 
  on the help of a magical device. Unfortunately, many high-level 
  devices may be forever beyond their use.
   
  Warriors cast no spells. They hate magic. In fact, they even gain 
  experience for destroying high level spellbooks. They have a class 
  power - 'Sword Dancing' - which allows them to conduct a melee attack 
  in six random directions.

  Weaponmaster
  A Weaponmaster is exceptionally good with a single class of weapons, 
  obtaining special combat bonuses and powers which depend on their 
  chosen speciality. Focus is the key to success; weaponmasters are 
  truly lousy with off-speciality weapons, but few can match the 
  prowess they gain with something more suitable in their hands.
  
  See [e] for more details on weaponmasters.

  Weaponsmith
  A Weaponsmith can improve weapons and armors for him or herself. They 
  are good at fighting, and they have potential ability to become even 
  better than Warriors using improved equipment. They cannot cast 
  spells, and are poor at skills such as stealth or magic defense.
   
  A Weaponsmith extracts the essences of special effects from weapons 
  or armors which have various special abilities, and can add these 
  essences to another weapon or armor. Normally, each equipment can be 
  improved only once, but they can remove a previously added essence 
  from improved equipment to improve it with another essence. To-hit, 
  to-damage bonus, and AC can be improved freely up to a maximum value 
  depending on level. Weaponsmiths use class powers for Smithing 
  commands.

Archery
  Archer
  Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best 
  class around with any bow, crossbow, or sling. They need a lot of 
  ammunition, but will learn how to make it from junk found in the 
  dungeon. An archer is better than a warrior at stealth, perception, 
  searching and magical devices.
   
  Archers have a class power - 'Create Ammo' - which creates pebbles or 
  shots from rubble, and arrows and crossbow bolts from bones.

  Sniper
  Snipers are specialists in marksmanship, but not like archers who 
  fire off arrow after arrow in swift succession. They don't just 
  increase accuracy and power of shots by concentration, they can use 
  fearsome archery techniques.
   
  What they require is powerful bows or crossbows, good quality 
  ammunition and the fortitude to bear up without flinching under any 
  situation.
   
  Snipers know their enemies well and can shoot them from the shadows. 
  They have no time for magic.

Martial Arts
  Force-Trainer
  A Force-Trainer is a master of the spiritual Force. They prefer 
  fighting with neither weapon nor armor. They are not as good fighters 
  as are Monks, but they can use both magic and the spiritual Force. 
  Wielding weapons or wearing heavy armor disturbs use of the Force. 
  Wisdom is a Force-Trainer's primary stat.
   
  Force-Trainers use both spellbook magic and the special spiritual 
  power called the Force. They can select a realm from Life, Nature, 
  Craft, Death, and Crusade. To use The Force, you select it just as if 
  it were spellbook 'F'; which means you need to press 'm' and then 'F' 
  to select the Force. The most important spell of the Force is 
  'Improve Force'; each time a Force-Trainer activates it, their Force 
  power becomes more powerful, and their attack power in bare-handed 
  melee fighting is increased temporarily. The strengthened Force can 
  be released at one stroke when a Force-Trainer activates some other 
  Force spell, typically an attack spell. They have a class power - 
  'Clear Mind' - which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.

  Monk
  Monks are very different from most other classes in that they prefer 
  to fight unarmed; while they can use a few select weapons reasonably 
  well, their training in martial arts makes them more powerful with no 
  weapons. Monks also gain bonuses from empty armor slots; to gain the 
  resistances necessary for survival, some kind of armor will still be 
  eventually needed, but if the armor is too heavy it will severely 
  disturb the Monk's martial arts maneuvers. As the Monk gains levels, 
  more powerful forms of unarmed attack will become available, and the 
  defensive bonuses for having empty armor slots likewise increase.
  
  The various sects of monks are devoted to different areas of magic; 
  they select one realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Trump and Death. 
  Monks will eventually learn all prayers in the discipline of their 
  choice. Wisdom determines their spellcasting ability.
  
  Monks have two class powers, 'Assume a Posture' and 'Double Attack'; 
  they can choose different postures for different situations, and use 
  powerful combinations of attacks for the finishing blow.

  Mystic
  Mystics are masters of bare-handed fighting, like Monks. Unlike 
  Monks, though, they do not learn normal spells; instead, they gain 
  mystical powers with experience, and these powers directly influence 
  their martial arts. In this respect, Mystics are somewhat similar to 
  Samurai; indeed, they even concentrate to boost their mana like the 
  Samurai. Mystics eschew weapons of any kind, and require the lightest 
  of armors in order to practice their martial arts. As with other 
  martial artists, their attack speed depends on their level and 
  Dexterity; their mana and fail rates, though, are influenced by 
  Charisma. Mystics are in tune with the natural forces around them, 
  and may even summon animals to their aid when necessary. It is 
  whispered that mystics have discovered a way to kill an opponent with 
  a single touch; but they do not share this knowledge with novices.

Magic
  Blood-Mage
  A Blood-Mage is similar to a normal mage in his selection and variety 
  of spells, but differs in that he has no separate mana pool; instead, 
  spells are powered by hit points. Moreover, due to the Blood-Mage's 
  abnormal constitution, all healing is much less effective than 
  normal; indeed, Blood-Mages completely eschew healing spells to not 
  disrupt the flow of blood that is the essence of their power. They 
  shun the realm of Life as anathema to all they hold sacred.

  they are unique in the way they gain new spells, as they learn from 
  monsters rather than books. Blue-Mages' primary spellcasting stat is 
  Intelligence.
   
  A Blue-Mage can learn and cast monster spells, summons, and even 
  ranged attacks as their own spells; this technique is called Blue 
  magic. Blue-Mages remember their spells permanently, but to learn a 
  spell they must be directly hit by it while their 'Learning' class 
  power is active. Because of this requirement, Blue-Mages never learn 
  spells like Haste or Healing that affect the monster itself.

  Chaos-Mage
  Chaos Mages are the arcane students of the terrible Demon Lords of 
  Chaos. Every Chaos Mage has a Patron Demon and, when gaining a level, 
  may receive a reward from his Patron. He might be healed or 
  polymorphed, his stats could be increased, or he might be rewarded 
  with an awesome weapon. On the other hand, the Patrons might surround 
  him with monsters, drain his stats or wreck his equipment or they 
  might simply ignore him. The Demon Lords of Chaos are chaotic and 
  unpredictable indeed. The exact type of reward depends on both the 
  Patron Demon (different Demons give different rewards) and chance.
   
  Chaos Mages can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon, and one other 
  realm excluding Life and Crusade. A  Chaos Mage's prime statistic is 
  Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.
   
  Chaos Mages are a little hardier than ordinary mages but less 
  perceptive. They have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs 
  mana from wands, staves or rods.

  Gray-Mage
  The Gray-Mage casts spells from memory rather than books; a spellbook 
  is only required for the initial learning process. However, only ten 
  spells may be memorized at any given time; and while a Gray-Mage may 
  replace old spells with new ones, the total number of spells they can 
  study is limited.
  
  Gray-Mages do not choose specific realms like book spellcasters; 
  instead, they choose a general bias towards either Good, Neutral or 
  Evil magic. So while all Gray-Mages may learn spells from the Arcane, 
  Armageddon, Chaos, Craft, Sorcery and Trump realms, only a Good Bias 
  allows access to Life and Crusade magic; only a Neutral Bias allows 
  access to Nature magic; and only an Evil Bias allows access to Death 
  and Daemon magic. At any one time, a Gray-Mage has relatively few 
  spells directly at their disposal; but their ability to pick the best 
  spells from an extremely large pool more than compensates for this. 
  As with most mages, the key stat is Intelligence.

  High-Mage
  High-Mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of magic 
  and learn it very well - much better than an ordinary mage.
  
  For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, High-Mages gain 
  substantial benefits in the mana costs, power, minimum levels, and 
  failure rates of the spells in their speciality realm. They are also 
  the only class able to cast Hex spells. High-Mages have a class power 
  - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves, or rods; 
  although this power is not available to those who choose the Hex 
  realm. Their primary spellcasting stat is Intelligence.

  Mage
  A Mage is a spellcaster who must live by his wits, as he cannot hope 
  to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. A Mage 
  always carries his spellbooks with him, but also relies on magical 
  devices, which he can master easily. The primary spellcasting 
  statistic of a Mage is Intelligence.
  
  Mages have few restrictions in choosing and learning spells; they can 
  freely choose any two realms when a character is created, although 
  their natural inclinations make Life magic fairly hard to learn. See 
  [f] for more information on magic, realms and book spellcasting.

  Priest
  A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They 
  explore the dungeon in the service of their God. They are fairly 
  familiar with magical devices, which they believe act as foci for 
  divine intervention in the natural order of things.
   
  There are two types of priests: Good and Evil. If the priest chooses 
  Life or Crusade as their first realm, they will follow the path of 
  good; as such, they may not choose an evil realm for their second 
  realm. Good priests abhor bloodshed, and therefore are not 
  comfortable with edged weapons, although they eventually learn to 
  bless such weapons and then use them without disrupting their 
  prayers. Should a priest choose Death or Daemon as their first realm, 
  however, they will serve an evil god; evil priests actually enjoy 
  shedding blood, and suffer no such weapon restrictions. Of course, 
  evil priests abhor good things, and are unable to choose Life or 
  Crusade for their second realm.
   
  Good priests have a strong affinity for Life prayers, and learn them 
  very well, even better than a High-Mage. Conversely, evil priests 
  favor prayers of Death, and receive strong bonuses when choosing this 
  foul realm. Otherwise, priests learn magic less efficiently than a 
  Mage would; but their greater stamina and combat skills compensate 
  for this. Priests, unlike Mages, cannot choose to study specific 
  spells; rather, they are granted new prayers by the whim of their 
  deity, presumably in accordance with some greater divine plan. The 
  primary stat for a priest is Wisdom.

  Necromancer
  A Necromancer attempts to gain both power and knowledge through 
  communion with the dead. They rely on the special realm of Necromancy 
  to summon aid from the dead, whether directly in terms of undead 
  servitude, or indirectly through otherworldly knowledge. Necromancy 
  also offers many foul offensive spells; but all of these require 
  direct physical contact, and so need an empty, gloveless hand to 
  work. Yet this handicap is a cheap price to pay for the ability to 
  kill a foe with one deadly touch!
  
  Necromancers forever hunt for the legendary Eye and Hand of Vecna to 
  complete their power.

  Sorcerer
  Sorcerers are the all-around best magicians, being able to master all 
  spells from almost any magic realm without needing to study them or 
  gain proficiency with them. On the downside, they have by far the 
  fewest hit points of any class; they are also the worst fighters in 
  the dungeon, being unable to use any weapon but a Wizardstaff.
   
  Sorcerers have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from 
  wands, staves or rods. Unlike other mages, they rely on Charisma as 
  their spell stat.

  Yellow-Mage
  A Yellow-Mage is a type of Mage who focuses on rapid spell casting. 
  The casting speed of Yellow-Mages improves with experience; low-level 
  spells are particularly quick to use, and can eventually be cast as 
  many as five times in one round! But even a level 50 spell requires 
  less than half a turn for an accomplished Yellow-Mage.
  
  In most other respects, a Yellow-Mage is similar to a Mage; they use 
  Intelligence as their primary spell stat, and may learn spells from 
  two spell realms of their choice. However, due to their focus on 
  hasty casting, some of the deepest and most powerful magic will 
  remain forever beyond their grasp.

Devices
  Alchemist
  Alchemists are masters of tinctures, concoctions and infusions. They 
  can prepare themselves set infusions from potions that replicate the 
  effect - without consuming inventory space or being in danger of 
  shattering. They are reasonably good at melee, especially with the 
  right potions, though they cannot rival melee specialists. Even bad 
  potions are useful in their hands, as weapons or ingredients. Their 
  other abilities include creating copies of potions and turning items 
  to gold. They require intelligence for some of their abilities.

  Devicemaster
  Devicemasters are excellent with magical devices, but poor in most 
  other skills. They may shoot or use melee in a pinch, but this will 
  never be their forte; instead, they conquer through their arsenal of 
  magical devices.
   
  Each Devicemaster chooses to specialize in a particular class of 
  devices, and will gain extra bonuses for speciality items. These 
  bonuses include increased damage, increased speed of activation, 
  extra resistance to charge draining, and even the ability to 
  occasionally power these devices without consuming charges; each of 
  these abilities becomes stronger with experience. In addition, 
  speciality devices are easier to use, although all Devicemasters are 
  also good with devices of other types.
   
  Devicemasters have several useful device-related powers; they may 
  detect magical devices from a distance, and gain the powerful talent 
  of Recharging very early on. At higher levels, they gain the ability 
  to move effects from one device to another, or to move magical 
  essences from one item to another if they specialize in Potions or 
  Scrolls. In times of desperate need, the Devicemaster may drain a 
  speciality item of multiple charges at once; this greatly increases 
  the power of the effect, but may destroy the device in the process.

  Magic-Eater
  The Magic-Eater can absorb magical devices. Once absorbed, these 
  devices will function like normal objects and can be used whenever 
  charges are available. In effect, it is as if the Magic-Eater had 
  extra inventory slots for devices. However, absorbed magic can not be 
  drained the way normal devices can, nor can these objects be 
  destroyed. The number of slots for each kind of device is limited, 
  and the Magic-Eater will need to choose which object to replace once 
  the slots are all used. Absorbed magic cannot be recharged through 
  scrolls, spells, potions or activations; the Magic-Eater must rest to 
  regain charges. The rate at which absorbed devices recharge is 
  affected by Regeneration.

Stealth
  Ninja
  A Ninja is a fearful assassin lurking in darkness. He or she can 
  navigate effectively with no light source, catch enemies by surprise, 
  and kill with a single blow. Ninjas can use Ninjutsu, and are good at 
  locating hidden traps and doors, disarming traps and picking locks. 
  Since heavy armors, heavy weapons, or shields will restrict their 
  motion greatly, they prefer light clothes, and become faster and more 
  stealthy as they gain levels. A Ninja knows no fear and, at high 
  level, becomes almost immune to poison and able to see invisible 
  things. Dexterity determines a Ninja's ability to use Ninjutsu.
   
  A Ninja can use Ninjutsu for lurking and surprise attacks. They gain 
  more Ninjutsu techniques as they gain levels. They have a class power 
  - 'Quick Walk' - which makes their walking speed extremely fast.

  Rogue
  A Rogue is a character who prefers to live by their cunning, yet is 
  capable of fighting their way out of a tight spot when necessary. 
  Rogues are good at locating secret doors and hidden traps, and are 
  masters of trap-disarming and lockpicking. Their exceptional stealth 
  allows rogues to sneak around sleeping creatures without having to 
  fight; they can also backstab a fleeing monster or surprise an enemy 
  with a telling first blow. Rogues are fairly good at ranged combat, 
  and receive special bonuses when shooting with a sling.
   
  Rogues can select one realm - Sorcery, Death, Trump, Arcane, Craft, 
  Law, or Burglary. Except for this last realm, rogues have certain 
  limitations on which spells they can learn, and they do not learn new 
  spells very quickly. The Burglary realm is unique to the rogue, and 
  the speciality of the class; it offers spells for setting traps, 
  picking pockets, negotiating with other thieves, and escaping from a 
  tight spot. Burglary rogues are agents of the Black Market and 
  receive favorable pricing from that shop. Burglary rogues use 
  Dexterity as their spellcasting stat, and can use this special art 
  from the beginning of their adventures; rogues of other realms, 
  however, rely on Intelligence and cannot learn magic spells before 
  they reach level 5.

  Scout
  The scout is the vanguard of any attack, and excels at stealth and 
  observation skills. Scouts are not the best at one-on-one combat, but 
  are unparalleled at ambush techniques for destroying groups of weak 
  sentries. Scouts are lightly armored, and heavy armor disrupts their 
  abilities. Unlike most characters, scouts are not at home in cramped 
  corridors; in open areas they can dodge attacks effectively, but 
  being confined severely hampers their defensive abilities.

Hybrid
  Chaos-Warrior
  Chaos-Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon Lords of 
  Chaos. Every Chaos-Warrior has a patron demon, who may give him a 
  reward on level-up; the Chaos-Warrior may be healed or polymorphed, 
  have his stats increased, or be rewarded with an awesome weapon. On 
  the other hand, though, he might be severely punished or simply 
  ignored by the patron; the Demon Lords of Chaos are unpredictable 
  indeed, although rewards are thankfully more common than punishments. 
  The exact reward will not depend on anything the player does, and is 
  up entirely to random chance and the patron; each patron gives out 
  different rewards and punishments.
   
  Chaos-Warriors select one spell realm, either Chaos or Daemon; they 
  have no interest in other forms of magic. They can learn every spell 
  in their chosen realm. At level 40 they gain the powerful ability to 
  emit confusing lights, with the potential to stun, scare and confuse 
  every creature in sight.

  Disciple
  Trusted followers of mysterious ancient spirits known as the 
  'Purples', the Disciples roam the world running errands for their 
  masters, learning mighty spells and receiving rare items as rewards 
  for their work. There are three main flavors of Purple Disciples - 
  disciples of Karrot, disciples of Yeqrezh, and disciples of a group 
  of Purples known as the Troika. Each of the Purples expects different 
  things of their Disciples, and each helps them achieve their ends in 
  very different ways.
  
  See [g] for more details on disciples.

  Ninja-Lawyer
  The Ninja-Lawyer moves silently in the night, combining the stealth, 
  agility and offensive power of the ninja with the subtle practical 
  tools of the lawyer. Ninja-Lawyers, like specialist ninjas, prefer 
  light armor and stabbing weapons and acquire the powerful 'Quick 
  Walk' class power. A ninja-lawyer relies on both wisdom and 
  dexterity, requiring the former for legal tricks and the latter for 
  ninjutsu.

  Paladin
  A Paladin is a combination of a warrior and a priest. Paladins excel 
  as melee fighters, but are only middling in ranged combat; their 
  stealth, perception, and device skill are likewise mediocre, though 
  their divine alliance gives them a decent saving throw. Wisdom 
  determines a Paladin's success at praying to his deity.
   
  Paladins can select a realm from Life, Crusade, Daemon and Death. 
  Like priests, they cannot select which prayers to learn, but are 
  rewarded with new prayers by their deities. They can learn all 
  spells, but not as fast as priests. They detest paganism so strongly 
  that they even gain experience for destroying high-level pagan 
  spellbooks: 'pagan' means Life or Crusade spellbooks for a 
  Death/Daemon Paladin, and all spellbooks other than Life or Crusade 
  for a Life/Crusade Paladin. Paladins receive one class power, 'Holy 
  Lance' or 'Hell Lance', depending on the alignment of their realm.

  Ranger
  A Ranger is a seasoned wanderer from the plains or woods, attuned to 
  the natural world. Rangers have few weak points; like mages they are 
  excellent with magic devices, yet they are also fairly good at using 
  bows and melee weapons. Their stealth, searching and perception have 
  been sharpened by their time in the wilderness, and their alliance 
  with the spirits of nature even gives them a good saving throw.
   
  All rangers are trained in Nature magic, and all Nature spells are 
  available to them; they even learn these spells almost as fast as 
  mages. They can also select a secondary realm (Sorcery, Chaos, Death, 
  Trump, Arcane, and Daemon); but they are slow learners here, and may 
  find themselves unable to learn some of the highest level spells. 
  Another downside is that rangers, like the priestly classes, lack the 
  ability to choose their own spells; they will learn whatever the 
  capricious nature gods choose to teach them.
  
  Rangers have a class power, 'Animal Companion', which allows them to 
  summon an animal to assist them.The magical powers of a ranger depend 
  on Wisdom.

  Red-Mage
  Red-Mages make better fighters than most mages, and are also 
  versatile spellcasters who can use many realms without needing to 
  specialize in only one or two. The downside of this wide scope is 
  that Red-Mages' magic is fairly shallow; they have high fail rates, 
  minimum levels and mana costs, and are limited to the first two 
  spellbooks in each realm except for Arcane.
  
  Red-Mages have a class power, 'Double Magic', which allows them to 
  cast two spells at once. As with regular mages, their spellcasting 
  stat is Intelligence.

  Warrior-Mage
  A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross between a 
  warrior and a mage. To support their good-for-mages combat abilities, 
  Warrior-Mages begin the game with Arcane magic and can freely select 
  another spell realm. Although they do not gain new spells as fast as 
  regular mages, they will eventually learn every spell in both realms, 
  thus making them a very competitive choice for those who appreciate 
  Arcane spells. Their class powers allow them to convert either HP to 
  mana, or mana to HP, as needed.

Riding
  Beastmaster
  Beastmasters see the fierce creatures of the world as opportunities 
  rather than threats, and their riding skills are almost unparalleled. 
  Between their class powers and access to Trump magic, they have many 
  ways to summon or charm living creatures to serve as their hands and 
  feet. Beastmasters are some of the best shooters outside archery 
  specialists, and their melee skills are good enough to get by on. 
  Charisma determines the spellcasting prowess of a Beastmaster.

  Cavalry
  Cavalry are masters of horsemanship and enjoy riding to battle. Being 
  good at both melee and archery, they take pride in their overwhelming 
  offensive strength on horseback; but spellcasting is a closed book to 
  them, and magical devices difficult to use. High-level Cavalry learn 
  to forcibly saddle and tame wild monsters with their 'Rodeo' class 
  power.

Mind
  Mindcrafter
  Mindcrafters rely not on book magic, but on the powers of the mind. 
  These mind powers are specific to this class, and range from 
  extrasensory perception to psychic attacks and the mental domination 
  of others. Most mind powers become accessible fairly early, but gain 
  in strength with more experience. Wisdom determines a Mindcrafter's 
  ability to use mind powers.
   
  Mindcrafters' combat skills are reasonably good but far from 
  outstanding; a combination of physical and mental attacks often works 
  better for them than either one alone. A seasoned mindcrafter is very 
  hard to confuse, and can effortlessly detect the minds of others. 
  Mindcrafters have a class power, 'Clear Mind', which allows them to 
  rapidly regenerate mana.

  Mirror-Master
  Mirror-Masters are spellcasters; like mages, they must live by their 
  wits. They can create magical mirrors, which they use to support 
  their special Mirror-Magic spells. Intelligence determines a 
  Mirror-Master's spellcasting ability.
   
  Mirror-Masters gain more spells with experience, and their spells 
  also become more powerful over time. Much of their magic relies on 
  the careful placement of mirrors, which can be used for both offense 
  and defense. Mirror-Masters' abilities are also enhanced by standing 
  on a mirror; for example, they can perform quick teleports from there 
  or rapidly regenerate their mana. Nevertheless, not all Mirror-Magic 
  requires a physical mirror; many effects rely simply on light or 
  mirror-shards, or on uncertainty, reflection and illusion. The 
  maximum number of Mirrors which can be controlled simultaneously 
  depends on the player's level; sometimes, unnecessary mirrors may 
  need to be broken.

  Psion
  Psions, like Mindcrafters, rely on their innate mental powers; 
  indeed, some of these powers resemble those of Mindcrafters. Unlike 
  Mindcrafters, though, Psions can select which powers they wish to 
  learn; together with their natural aptitude in a fairly broad range 
  of skills, this makes Psions one of the most versatile classes. Most 
  psionic powers are extremely strong, but the number of powers a Psion 
  can learn is very limited: one each at levels 1, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 
  40 and 50.
  
  The potency of psionic powers can be scaled up or down as needed, 
  within limits; the more mana is spent, the more powerful the effect. 
  All psionic powers require great concentration, leaving the Psion 
  little time for pets. Psions do not have one fixed spell stat; they 
  can use either Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma, whichever is the 
  highest. In this respect they are truly unique!

  Time-Lord
  Time-Lords are masters of temporal magic, altering the flow of time 
  to their advantage. They gain new powers as their experience grows, 
  and are unique in their ability to use time-based spells against 
  monsters. Not only do these attacks damage a foe, they also inflict a 
  wide variety of possible effects, from slowing to amnesia, from 
  evolution to devolution, from weakening to stasis. In addition to 
  temporal attacks, Time-Lords gain great powers of speed, and become 
  naturally faster with experience. Legend has it that masters of time 
  can even see into the future, avoiding attacks that would otherwise 
  prove fatal!
   
  Time-Lords are fairly proficient with magical devices, but are 
  mediocre fighters and not good at archery at all. At high levels, 
  they become resistant to time. Time-Lords' primary stat is Wisdom.

  Warlock
  Warlocks are a magical class; they derive their spells and powers not 
  from books, but from an eldritch pact made with a given class of 
  monsters. This pact is irrevocable and is made at the outset of the 
  Warlock's career. Depending on the class of monsters with whom they 
  ally, the warlock will gain unique bonuses, abilities and magical 
  powers; for example, alliance with the forces of the netherworld 
  grants resistances to poison and nether, enhanced constitution and 
  spells to control and conjure the unliving, as well as spells to 
  access the damaging forces of the netherworld directly. Each such 
  alliance has thematic bonuses and powers, and you can read the 
  details in the respective help sections.
  
  Allying with a given class of monsters dramatically reduces the 
  warlock's ability to fight these foes. Instead, the warlock seeks 
  cooperation with their brethren, or perhaps domination over them; 
  direct assaults are rarely successful.
   
  In addition to pact-related spells, all warlocks gain access to the 
  unique power of the Eldritch Blast. Their primary spell stat is 
  Charisma, since they seek dominion and alliance with their chosen 
  kin, and these monsters tend to have a strong will of their own.
  
  See [h] for more details on warlock pacts.

  Archaeologist
  The Archaeologist is an erudite treasure hunter, seeking out the most 
  valuable prizes that the dungeon has to offer. At home in 
  subterranean caverns and vaults, he is rarely lost or snared in 
  traps. His powers of perception and detection are very great, as is 
  his skill with arcane devices. At high levels he can use the dark 
  magic of the entombed Pharaohs. The powers of the Archaeologist are 
  enhanced by Wisdom.

  Bard
  Bards are traditional musicians, and songs and sound are the 
  foundation of their magic. Four songbooks are available to a Bard, 
  two of them sold in towns. Some songs are over in a quick yelp, 
  consuming no more time than a magic spell would; but most continue to 
  be sung, with continuing effects, until the bard either chooses to 
  stop or runs out of mental energy. A bard can only ever sing one tune 
  at a time. The primary spell stat of a bard is Charisma.

  Imitator
  Imitators have enough fighting skills to survive, but rely on their 
  unique technique - 'Imitation' - which imitates monster 
  spells/techniques including their damage and duration. Dexterity 
  determines general imitation ability, but a stat related to the 
  specific action is often also taken into account.
   
  To use imitation, Imitators must see monster's spell at first. When a 
  viewable monsters uses a spell, it is added to a temporary spell list 
  which the imitator can choose from. Spells should be imitated 
  quickly, because timing and situation are everything. An imitator can 
  only repeat a spell once each time he observes it. They only have a 
  small long-term memory for spells, which ranges from one to three, 
  depending on their level. When they memorize more spells than this, 
  they will forget the oldest spell in the list. They have a class 
  power - 'Double Revenge' - which allows them to imitate spells at 
  double damage or duration.

  Lawyer
  Known for his unsurpassed expertise in the mysterious realm of Law, 
  the Lawyer has a comprehensive skillset that allows him to set and 
  detect traps, to slow or mystify his enemies, to quietly escape or 
  avoid dangerous fights, to acquire knowledge about the world around 
  him, and to make friends and influence people. As he relies on his 
  familiarity with Law and with tricks and approaches that have worked 
  in the past, the lawyer uses Wisdom as his spellcasting stat.

  Politician
  Politicians are masters of spinning and manipulation, seeking to 
  convert others to their cause and to destroy those they cannot 
  convert. They are not very good at either direct combat or at using 
  magical devices, and rely on their savvy and special skills and on 
  the help of their friends to win fights. They have the ability to 
  toggle between hit points, wealth and experience as the source of 
  their power, although the latter two only become available at higher 
  levels. Charisma is a key stat for Politicians.

  Rage-Mage
  Rage-Mages are part of a secret sect, originally founded by 
  Barbarians in response to their natural foes, the mages. With the 
  passing of time, other races have also begun to study these arts.
  
  Rage techniques are learned from books, but differ from normal spells 
  in many ways. First of all, the Rage-Mage must perform a special 
  Ritual of Anger to learn a power, and this ritual destroys the book; 
  as a result, it may take a long time for the Rage-Mage to learn all 
  of their high-level powers. Books are required only for learning; the 
  powers, once learned, can be used without them.
  
  Another unique aspect of Rage-Mages concerns their mana pool. 
  Rage-Mage mana, unlike that of normal spellcasters, does not 
  regenerate on its own; in fact, it actually decreases rapidly each 
  turn, meaning Rage-Mages had better use their powers quickly while 
  they still can. A Rage-Mage gains mana whenever he is the target of a 
  magical spell; indeed, magic makes a Rage-Mage very angry! Rage-Mages 
  can also fuel their mana by hurting those around them, which can be 
  quite effective in crowded situations.

  Skillmaster
  The Skillmaster is not your ordinary class. Instead, you may design 
  your own class, on the fly, using a point-based skill system. Upon 
  birth, you will get 5 points to spend; use them wisely to set the 
  basic direction of your class. Every fifth character level, you will 
  receive an additional point to spend, for fifteen points overall. You 
  may use these points to learn melee, to master a spell realm, to 
  improve your speed or stealth, to increase your magic device skills, 
  to gain special techniques, to learn riding, dual-wielding or martial 
  arts... no other class, even Psion or Yeqrezh Disciple, offers as 
  much flexibility.
  
  Most skills allow the investment of multiple points for increased 
  proficiency, but some are abilities that you may buy with a single 
  point (e.g. Luck). This class is not recommended for beginning 
  players, despite being quite strong; you only have a limited amount 
  of points to spend, and your choices are irreversible.
  
  See [i] for more details on skillmasters.

  Tourist
  Tourists have visited this world for the purpose of sightseeing. 
  Their fighting skills are bad, and they cannot cast powerful spells. 
  They are the most difficult class to win the game with. Intelligence 
  determines a tourist's spellcasting ability.
   
  Tourists are always seeing more of the world to add to their stock of 
  information; no other class can compete with their identification 
  skills. They have a class power - 'Take a Photograph' Their magic is 
  based on Arcane, and - aside from identify - is very weak indeed.

  Wild-Talent
  Wild-Talents gain random talents and abilities as they level up. They 
  are good fighters, and decent with magical devices, but their true 
  forte is their vast array of potential random powers. Except you 
  never know what those might be!
   
  Wild-Talents do not have a spell stat. Instead, each ability that 
  they gain requires its own individual stat for the purposes of fail 
  rate calculation; for example, Tossing a Boulder requires Strength, 
  while Magic Missile requires Intelligence. Each spell requires mana 
  to cast, but the amount of mana available is not influenced by any 
  particular stat and is determined simply by experience.
