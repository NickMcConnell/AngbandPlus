The Classes

No decision is so important as which class to play. Below, the many 
available classes are loosely grouped by their principle playstyle: 
Melee, Archery, Martial Arts, Magic, Devices, etc. The hybrid classes 
generally combine melee with a bit of magic and are a good option for a 
balanced playstyle. In this document, the primary spell stat for each 
class is highlighted.

For details on the Primary Statistics, see [a]. For information about 
the various Skills, see [b]. The skill descriptions in this document 
are for comparison purposes only. For example, your fledgling berserker 
will not be born with Legendary[32] melee skill. In general, skills are 
influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. To compare the 
various classes at a glance, you might want to take a look at [c] the 
class tables below.

Melee
  Blood-Knight
  A Blood-Knight is a fighter who has delved into the dark arts and can 
  perform a limited number of offensive effects using his own health. 
  In addition to the HP cost, using an ability also causes 
  bleeding/wounds, with an amount proportional to the cost of the 
  ability. Their primary stat for abilities is Con.
   
  Blood-Knights are strong in melee, but are very unusual in the fact 
  that the more wounded they are, the stronger they become. When 
  damaged, they gain additional melee attacks and damage, and moreso 
  the more wounded and cut they become. Indeed, when on the brink of 
  death they are the strongest fighters imaginable, and stories of 
  their legendary feats abound. Of course, with great power comes great 
  risk of death, and you don't recall ever meeting one of these heroes 
  of legend in person!
   
  Since the Blood-Knight relies on their own blood for their power, 
  they are restricted to only certain races. No non-living race may 
  walk the red path.

  Duelist
  The duelist is the ultimate one-on-one fighter, but finds himself at 
  a severe disadvantage when facing numerous strong foes. When facing 
  an enemy, the duelist first issues a challenge, marking that foe for 
  a one on one duel. Of course, this wakes the monster up (There is no 
  honor in dueling a sleeping enemy). And while the duelist will honor 
  the fight as a one on one affair, many monsters have no such 
  scruples.
  
  Against a challenged foe, the duelist is very strong gaining a bonus 
  to saving throws, armor class, damage reduction and combat prowess. 
  On the other hand, due to the single-mindedness of their focus, the 
  duelist is quite vulnerable to unchallenged opponents. Most of the 
  techniques of this class aim at enforcing the sanctity of the duel.
  
  The duelist only ever gains a single attack in combat, but they make 
  the most of this blow by gaining enhanced effects as they gain 
  experience. Able to wound, stun, and even hamstring their foes, the 
  prowess of the duelist in a one on one encounter is legendary!
  
  Duelists favor light armors and cannot equip a shield. They gain no 
  extra bonus when wielding a weapon with both hands. For their 
  techniques the duelist relies on dexterity.

  Mauler
  The Mauler favors extremely heavy weapons, and possesses powerful 
  abilities whose effectiveness depends on the weight of the weapon. 
  While they only gain a limited number of blows which can never be 
  magically increased, they are capable of hitting opponents very hard 
  to make the most of each strike. The Mauler is required to use both 
  hands on a single weapon when wielding if they wish their talents to 
  function properly.

  Rune-Knight
  The Rune Knight is a mythical warrior who is dedicated to the 
  discovery of ancient runes that hold immense power. They may fix 
  mystical runes of various types to their equipment in order to gain 
  permanent bonuses, even on artifacts! Alternatively, they may conjure 
  a temporary rune which, when placed on their weapon, allows them to 
  attack with enhanced effects. They may also place temporary runes 
  directly on their person for one time or temporary bonuses. Finally, 
  they may even alter their surroundings with various runes of change.
   
  All runes (except {Absorption}) require mana for creation. However, 
  unlike ordinary spell casters, the Rune Knight does not regenerate 
  mana on their own. Rather, they must siphon mana from magical or 
  elemental attacks directed against them, and doing so requires a 
  special rune of {Absorption}. This rune should be worn at all times 
  (or at least kept handy).
   
  The Rune Knight does not play like an ordinary spell caster. Rather, 
  think of them as a cross between a a warrior and a weaponsmith that 
  can, on occasion, cast a useful spell. If you have mana available, 
  then consider using spells. Otherwise, play as a warrior and wait to 
  absorb mana. This can take time, depending on the foes you face, but 
  the Rune Knight's honor should prevent them from seeking out weak, 
  defensless spell casters.
  
  See [d] for more details on rune knights.

  Samurai
  Samurai, masters of the art of the blade, are the next strongest 
  fighters after Warriors, and can use various special combat 
  techniques. Samurai are not good at most other skills, and many 
  magical devices may be too difficult for them to use. Wisdom 
  determines a Samurai's ability to use the special combat techniques 
  available to him.
   
  Samurai use the art of the blade called Kendo (or Bugei). Books of 
  Kendo are similar to spellbooks, but Samurai don't need to carry them 
  around; the books are needed only when they study new combat 
  techniques. Samurai need a weapon wielded to use the techniques of 
  Kendo, and most techniques will add powerful special properties to 
  their blows; such as flaming, poisoning, vampiric, etc... Their 
  maximum spellpoints don't depend on their level but solely on wisdom, 
  and they can use the class power 'Concentration' to temporarily 
  increase SP beyond its usual maximum value. They have one more class 
  power - 'Assume a Posture'. They can choose different forms of 
  posture in different situations.

  Warrior
  A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his 
  problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back 
  on the help of a magical device. Unfortunately, many high-level 
  devices may be forever beyond their use.
   
  Warriors cast no spells. They hate magic. In fact, they even gain 
  experience for destroying high level spellbooks. They have a class 
  power - 'Sword Dancing' - which allows them to conduct a melee attack 
  in six random directions.

  Weaponmaster
  The weaponmaster is great with a single class of weapons. The 
  character gets combat bonuses and special powers depending on the 
  type of specialization. Alas, the weaponmaster is truly lousy when 
  using any weapon outside their chosen specialty so focus is key.
  
  See [e] for more details on weaponmasters.

  Weaponsmith
  A Weaponsmith can improve weapons and armors for him or herself. They 
  are good at fighting, and they have potential ability to become even 
  better than Warriors using improved equipment. They cannot cast 
  spells, and are poor at skills such as stealth or magic defense.
   
  A Weaponsmith extracts the essences of special effects from weapons 
  or armors which have various special abilities, and can add these 
  essences to another weapon or armor. Normally, each equipment can be 
  improved only once, but they can remove a previously added essence 
  from improved equipment to improve it with another essence. To-hit, 
  to-damage bonus, and AC can be improved freely up to a maximum value 
  depending on level. Weaponsmiths now use class powers for Smithing 
  commands.

Archery
  Archer
  Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best 
  class around with any bow, crossbow, or sling. They need a lot of 
  ammunition, but will learn how to make it from junk found in the 
  dungeon. An archer is better than a warrior at stealth, perception, 
  searching and magical devices.
   
  Archers have a class power - 'Create Ammo' - which creates stones or 
  shots from pile of rubble, and arrows and crossbow bolts from bones.

  Sniper
  Snipers are specialists in marksmanship, but not like archers who 
  fire off arrow after arrow in swift succession. They don't just 
  increase accuracy and power of shots by concentration, they can use 
  fearsome archery techniques.
   
  What they require is powerful bows or crossbows, good quality 
  ammunition and the fortitude to bear up without flinching under any 
  situation.
   
  Snipers know their enemies well and can shoot them from the shadows. 
  They have no time for magic.

Martial Arts
  Force-Trainer
  A ForceTrainer is a master of the spiritual Force. They prefer 
  fighting with neither weapon nor armor. They are not as good fighters 
  as are Monks, but they can use both magic and the spiritual Force. 
  Wielding weapons or wearing heavy armor disturbs use of the Force. 
  Wisdom is a ForceTrainer's primary stat.
   
  ForceTrainers use both spellbook magic and the special spiritual 
  power called the Force. They can select a realm from Life, Nature, 
  Craft, Death, and Crusade. The most important spell of the Force is 
  'Improve Force'; each time a ForceTrainer activates it, their Force 
  power becomes more powerful, and their attack power in bare-handed 
  melee fighting is increased temporarily. The strengthened Force can 
  be released at one stroke when a ForceTrainer activates some other 
  Force spell, typically an attack spell. They have a class power - 
  'Clear Mind' - which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.

  Monk
  The Monk character class is very different from all other classes. 
  Their training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with no 
  armor or weapons. To gain the resistances necessary for survival a 
  monk may need to wear some kind of armor, but if the armor he wears 
  is too heavy, it will severely disturb his martial arts maneuvers. As 
  the monk advances levels, new, powerful forms of attack become 
  available. Their defensive capabilities increase likewise, but if 
  armour is being worn, this effect decreases. Wisdom determines a 
  Monk's spell casting ability.
   
  The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas of magic. 
  They select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, Daemon and Death; their 
  choice may even influence their martial arts attacks! They will 
  eventually learn all prayers in the discipline of their choice. They 
  have two class powers - 'Assume a Posture' and 'Double Attack'. They 
  can choose different forms of postures in different situations, and 
  use powerful combinations of attacks for the finishing blow.

  Mystic
  Mystics are masters of bare handed fighting, like Monks. However, 
  they do not learn normal spells. Instead, they gain mystical powers 
  with experience, and these powers directly influence their martial 
  arts. In this respect, Mystics are similar to the Samurai. Indeed, 
  they even concentrate to boost their mana like the Samurai. Mystics 
  eschew weapons of any kind and require the lightest of armors in 
  order to practice their martial arts. The number of attacks are 
  influenced by dexterity and experience level while the mystic's mana 
  and fail rates are influenced by charisma. Mystics are in tune with 
  the natural forces around them and may even call on aid when 
  necessary. It has been whispered that mystics have even discovered 
  how to kill an opponent with a single touch, though they do not share 
  this knowledge with novices.

Magic
  Blue-Mage
  The Blue-Mage is not your ordinary mage. Rather than using 
  spellbooks, the blue-mage learns monster spells through direct 
  experience. With their special technique of Learning they have a 
  chance to learn spells every time they see a monster perform a spell. 
  The odds of learning the spell depend on the player's level and the 
  monster's level. Moreover, when performing learned spells, the 
  effectiveness depends upon the monster they learned the spell from; 
  breathing fire learned from a fire hound is much less effective then 
  the same learned from a Great Hell Wyrm! Finally, the blue-mage can 
  only remember a limited number of spells at a time. Learning a new 
  spell must replace an existing spell once this limit is reached.
  
  The Blue-Mage is weak in melee and archery, but not nearly so bad as 
  a normal mage would be. This is fortunate, since it may take a little 
  while to learn that first offensive spell. Starting players will need 
  to use melee and archery until an arsenal of good monster spells is 
  acquired.

  Gray-Mage
  The Gray-Mage casts spells from memory, rather than from a book.  
  Indeed, the spell book is only required for the initial learning 
  process. However, only a small number of spells may be learned at any 
  given time, and while the Gray-Mage may replace old spells with new 
  ones, they can only learn a fixed number of total spells (based upon 
  Intelligence and Experience).
   
  The Gray-Mage does not choose spell realms the way an ordinary spell 
  caster would. Instead, they choose a general bias towards one of 
  Good, Neutral or Evil magic. So while all Gray-Mages may learn spells 
  from the Arcane, Armageddon, Craft, Sorcery and Trump realms, only a 
  Good Bias allows access to Life and Crusade magic; only a Neutral 
  Bias allows access to Nature and Chaos magic; and only an Evil Bias 
  allows access to Death and Daemon magic. Still, it is obvious that 
  the Gray Mage will have an extremely large pool of spells from which 
  to choose. Like the Mage, Intelligence is the key stat.

  High-Mage
  High-mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of magic 
  and learn it very well - much better than the ordinary mage. A high 
  mage's prime statistic is intelligence as this determines his spell 
  casting ability.
   
  For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, High-mages gain 
  substantial benefits in the mana costs, power, minimum levels, and 
  failure rates of the spells in their speciality realm. They have a 
  class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves, or 
  rods.

  Mage
  A Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits as he cannot hope 
  to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. In 
  addition to his spellbooks, a Mage should carry a range of magical 
  devices to help him in his endeavors which he can master far more 
  easily than anyone else. A Mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as 
  this determines his spell casting ability.
   
  Mages have the least restrictions in choosing and learning spells. 
  They can freely choose any two realms when a character is created. 
  Their natural inclination makes Life magic fairly hard to learn. 
  Otherwise, a mage tends to learn and cast all the spells in his or 
  her realms better than any other character. The ability to choose 
  second realm of magic has a special meaning: Only the second realm 
  can be changed in the middle of the game. You can change second realm 
  by studying ('G') from a spellbook of new realm. They have a class 
  power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods.

  Necromancer
  A Necromancer attempts to gain both power and knowledge through 
  communion with the dead. They use powerful necromancy magic to summon 
  aid from the dead, whether directly in terms of undead servitude, or 
  indirectly through other-worldly knowledge. Necromancy also offers 
  myriad foul offensive spells, but all of these require the 
  Necromancer to physically touch his foe. To do so, the Necromancer 
  may wield neither weapon, nor gloves. But a powerful necromancer is 
  truly awe inspiring, and may even kill foes with a single deadly 
  touch! In addition, they forever hunt for the legendary Eye and Hand 
  of Vecna in order to complete their power.
  
  The necromancer can see in the dark and need not wear an ordinary 
  light source. Without a light source they can hide in shadows, but 
  this requires a necromantic spell.

  Sorcerer
  Sorcerers are the all-around best magicians, being able to cast any 
  spell from most magic realms without having to learn it. On the 
  downside, they are the worst fighters in the dungeon, being unable to 
  use any weapon but a Wizardstaff.
   
  Sorcerers can cast any spell from any spellbooks of all magic realms 
  with 'Master' proficiency level without having to learn it. They have 
  a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves 
  or rods.

  Yellow-Mage
  A Yellow Mage is a type of Mage who focuses on rapid spell casting. 
  Much as the Warrior gets multiple attacks per round, the Yellow Mage 
  may cast multiple spells per round. Their spell speed increases with 
  level. In addition, they may also cast low level spells more quickly 
  as they gain in experience (For example, a CL50 Yellow Mage casting a 
  L35 spell only requires 85% of the normal time, and this bonus 
  applies before their spells per round bonus).
   
  In all other respects, the Yellow Mage is similar to the Mage. They 
  may learn spells from two spell realms and use Intelligence as their 
  primary spell statistic. However, due to their focus upon hasty 
  casting, they are unable to learn the mightiest of spells in most 
  realms, especially as regards powerful offensive spells like Mana 
  Storm.

Devices
  Devicemaster
  Devicemasters are excellent with magical devices, but poor in most 
  other skills. They may shoot or use melee in a pinch, but this will 
  never be their forte. Instead, they must rely on their arsenal of 
  magical devices in order to survive.
   
  The Devicemaster chooses to specialize in a particular class of 
  devices and they gain extra bonuses when using devices from their 
  speciality. These bonuses include increased damage, increased speed 
  of activation, extra resistance to charge draining, and even the 
  ability to occasionally power these devices without consuming 
  charges. Each of these abilities becomes greater with experience. In 
  addition, they gain enhanced device skill with speciality devices.
   
  Devicemasters have a few magical abilities to enhance their utility 
  with devices. As expected, they gain a powerful talent of Recharging 
  very early on. Also, they may detect magical devices from a distance. 
  At higher levels, they gain the powerful ability to move effects from 
  one device to another (wand/rod/staff) or to move essence from one 
  potion/scroll to a lower level potion/scroll. As a final ability, the 
  Devicemaster may use multiple charges at once from a given device in 
  an act of desperation. This greatly increases the power of the 
  effect, but may destroy the device in the process.

  Magic-Eater
  The Magic-Eater can absorb magical devices. Once absorbed, these 
  devices will function like normal objects and can be used whenever 
  charges are available. In effect, it is as if the Magic-Eater had 
  extra inventory slots for devices. However, absorbed magic can not be 
  drained the way normal devices can, nor can these objects be 
  destroyed. There are fixed number of slots for each kind of device, 
  and the Magic-Eater will need to choose which object to replace once 
  the slots are all used. Absorbed magic can not be recharged the way 
  normal devices can. Instead, the Magic-Eater must rest to regain 
  charges the way a normal spellcaster must rest to regain mana. 
  Similarly, the Magic-Eater may quaff a potion to restore mana to 
  speed this process, though this will not necessarily restore all of 
  their absorbed magic.

Prayer
  Priest
  A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They 
  explore the dungeon in the service of their God. They are fairly 
  familiar with magical devices which they believe act as foci for 
  divine intervention in the natural order of things.
   
  There are three types of priests. If the priest chooses Life or 
  Crusade as their first realm, then they will follow the path of good. 
  As such, they may not choose an evil realm for their second realm. 
  Also, good priests abhor bloodshed, and therefore are not comfortable 
  with edged weapons. Wielding one will disrupt their ability to 
  concentrate during prayers. Should a priest choose Death or Daemon as 
  their first realm, however, then they will serve an evil god. As 
  such, they actually enjoy shedding blood, and suffer no such weapon 
  restriction. Of course, evil priests abhor good things, and are 
  unable to choose Life or Crusade for their second realm. Finally, 
  priests may serve Nature as a druid. Like good priests, they too 
  abhor bloodshed. For their second realm, they may choose neither good 
  nor evil prayers.
   
  Good priests have a strong affinity for Life prayers, and learn them 
  very well, even better than a High Mage. Conversely, evil priests 
  favor prayers of Death, and receive strong bonuses when choosing this 
  foul realm. Otherwise, priests learn spells less efficiently than a 
  Mage would. Also, they may not choose which spell to learn, but are 
  granted new prayers by the whim of their deity, presumably in order 
  to serve some greater divine plan of which the priest is not fully 
  cognizant. The priest's primary prayer stat is Wisdom.

  High-Priest
  Similar to the Priest, the High-Priest is a character devoted to 
  serving a higher power. However, the High-Priest specializes in a 
  single realm of prayer in order to gain awesome bonuses in casting 
  costs and fail rates. Service to the good involes choosing Life, 
  Crusade or Benediction magic, and these choices restrict the player 
  to using blunt weapons (unless otherwise 'blessed'). Service to evil 
  involves choosing one of Death, Daemon or Malediction, and the evil 
  priest is under no compunction concerning the spilling of blood. In 
  fact, they revel in it! Finally, a High-Priest may serve Nature, a 
  realm of balance. In this case, sharp weapons are prohibited as they 
  are kin to the much hated axe, feller of trees. Each realm choice 
  will grant additional abilities, skills or powers. Of course, wisdom 
  is the primary stat.
  
  Benediction and Malediction magic are quite unique and involve spells 
  that are chanted continuously to maintain an effect. Like the Bard, 
  the priest vocalizes spells in a continuous fashion granting 
  abilities as long as the chant is maintained. But unlike the Bard, 
  the priest may evoke multiple chants at once, weaving the rhythms in 
  an intricate display of musical prowess.

Stealth
  Ninja
  A Ninja is a fearful assassin lurking in darkness. He or she can 
  navigate effectively with no light source, catch enemies by surprise, 
  and kill with a single blow. Ninjas can use Ninjutsu, and are good at 
  locating hidden traps and doors, disarming traps and picking locks. 
  Since heavy armors, heavy weapons, or shields will restrict their 
  motion greatly, they prefer light clothes, and become faster and more 
  stealthy as they gain levels. A Ninja knows no fear and, at high 
  level, becomes almost immune to poison and able to see invisible 
  things. Dexterity determines a Ninja's ability to use Ninjutsu.
   
  A Ninja can use Ninjutsu for lurking and surprise attacks. They gain 
  more Ninjutsu techniques as they gain levels. They have a class power 
  - 'Quick Walk' - which makes their walking speed extremely fast.

  Rogue
  A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is 
  capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot. Rogues are good at 
  locating hidden traps and doors and are masters of disarming traps 
  and picking locks. A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneak 
  around many creatures without having to fight, or to get in a telling 
  first blow. A rogue may also backstab a fleeing monster. Rogues also 
  gain shooting bonuses when using a sling.
   
  Rogues can select one realm from Sorcery, Death, Trump, Arcane, 
  Craft, or Burglary. Except for this last realm, rogues have certain 
  limitations on which spells they can learn, and they do not learn new 
  spells very quickly. The Burglary Realm however is unique to the 
  rogue and offers spells for setting traps, picking pockets, 
  negotiating with other thieves, and escaping from a tight spot. 
  Burglary rogues are agents of the Black Market and receive favorable 
  pricing from that shop. A Burglary rogue uses DEX as their 
  spellcasting stat, and may learn spells beginning at level 1. For 
  other realms, however, the rogue uses INT as the spellcasting stat, 
  and won't be able to learn spells until level 5.

  Scout
  The scout is the vanguard of any attack, and excels at stealth and 
  observation skills. The scout is not the best at one-on-one combat, 
  but is unparalleled at ambush techniques to destroy groups of weak 
  sentries. The scout is lightly armored, and heavy armors disrupt 
  their abilities. Furthermore, the scout can only effectively dodge in 
  open areas, being confined severely hampers the scout's defensive 
  abilities.

Hybrid
  Chaos-Warrior
  Chaos Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon Lords of 
  Chaos. Every Chaos Warrior has a Patron Demon and, when gaining a 
  level, may receive a reward from his Patron. He might be healed or 
  polymorphed, his stats could be increased, or he might be rewarded 
  with an awesome weapon. On the other hand, the Patrons might surround 
  him with monsters, drain his stats or wreck his equipment or they 
  might simply ignore him. The Demon Lords of Chaos are chaotic and 
  unpredictable indeed. The exact type of reward depends on both the 
  Patron Demon (different Demons give different rewards) and chance.
   
  Chaos Warriors can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon. They are not 
  interested in any other form of magic. They can learn every spell. 
  They have a class power - 'Confusing Light' - which stuns, confuses, 
  and scares all monsters in sight.

  Paladin
  A Paladin is a combination of a warrior and a priest. Paladins are 
  very good fighters, but not very good at missile weapons. A paladin 
  lacks much in the way of abilities. He is poor at stealth, 
  perception, searching, and magical devices but has a decent saving 
  throw due to his divine alliance. Wisdom determines a Paladin's 
  success at praying to his deity.
   
  Paladins can select a realm from Life, Crusade, Daemon and Death. 
  Like priests, they cannot select which prayers to learn, but are 
  rewarded with new prayers by their deities. They can learn all 
  spells, but not as fast as priests. They detest paganism so strongly 
  that they will even gain experience for destroying high-level pagan 
  spellbooks: 'pagan' means Life or Crusade spellbooks for a 
  Death/Daemon Paladin and all spellbooks other than Life or Crusade 
  for a Life/Crusade Paladin. Depending on their realm, they have a 
  class power - 'Holy Lance' or 'Hell Lance'.

  Ranger
  A Ranger is a combination of a warrior and a mage who has developed a 
  special affinity for the natural world around him. He is a good 
  fighter and also excellent with a bow. A ranger has good stealth, 
  perception, searching and magical resistance. Also, rangers are 
  familiar with magical devices and use them well. Intelligence 
  determines a Ranger's spell casting ability.
   
  All rangers are trained in Nature magic, and all of these spells are 
  available to them. They even learn these spells almost as fast as 
  mages. They can also select a secondary realm (from Sorcery, Chaos, 
  Death, Trump, Arcane, and Daemon), but they are slow learners here, 
  and may find themselves unable to learn some of the highest level 
  spells. They have a class power - 'Probe Monster' - which allows them 
  to know a monster's HP, speed, and experience required to evolve.

  Red-Mage
  Red Mages are similar to Warrior-Mage; they are decent fighters and 
  spellcasters. Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower rank 
  spellbooks of all realms, but they cannot cast spells from higher 
  rank spellbooks, and they are extremely slow learners in them. They 
  are not bad at using magical devices and magic resistance, but are 
  bad at other skills. A red-mage's prime statistic is intelligence.
   
  Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower rank spellbooks of all 
  realms: first and second spellbooks of all realms and third and 
  fourth Arcane spellbooks, without having to learn it, but they cannot 
  cast spells from higher rank spellbooks; third and fourth spellbooks 
  for all realms other than Arcane. Since they use all realms at once, 
  they have large penalties in the mana costs, minimum levels, and 
  failure rates of spells. They have a class power - 'Double Magic' - 
  which allows them to cast two spells at once.

  Warrior-Mage
  A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross between 
  the warrior and mage classes. While their brothers, the rangers, 
  specialize in Nature magic and survival skills, true Warrior-Mages 
  attempt to reach the best of both worlds. As warriors they are much 
  superior to the usual Mage class. Intelligence determines a 
  Warrior-Mage's spell casting ability.
   
  Warrior-mages begin the game with Arcane magic, and they can freely 
  select another realm of magic. Although they do not gain new spells 
  as fast as regular mages, they will eventually learn every spell in 
  both realms, thus making them a very competitive choice for players 
  who appreciate Arcane magic. They have two class powers - 'Convert HP 
  to SP' and 'Convert SP to HP' - which allow them to heal HP using 
  mana or gain mana using HP.

Riding
  Beastmaster
  Beastmasters are in tune with the minds of the creatures of the 
  world. They are very good at riding, and have enough fighting 
  ability. They use monsters which have been summoned or dominated as 
  their hands and feet. Beastmasters can cast trump magic, and are very 
  good at summoning spells, but they can not summon non-living 
  creatures. Charisma determines a Beastmaster's spell casting ability.
   
  Beastmasters use Trump magic to make good use of their monster 
  domination and riding abilities. They are very good at summoning 
  living creatures, and they learn summoning spells quicker than Mages. 
  However, they cannot summon non-living creatures. They have two class 
  powers - 'Dominate a Living Thing' and 'Dominate Living Things'.

  Cavalry
  Cavalry ride on horses into battle. Although they cannot cast spells, 
  they are proud of their overwhelming offensive strength on horseback. 
  They are good at shooting. At high levels, they learn to forcibly 
  saddle and tame wild monsters. Since they take pride in the body and 
  the soul, they don't use magical devices well.
   
  Like Warriors and Archers, the cavalry don't use magic. Since they 
  are very good at riding, they have a class power - 'Rodeo' - which 
  allows them to forcibly saddle and tame wild monsters.

Mind
  Mindcrafter
  The Mindcrafter is a unique class that uses the powers of the mind 
  instead of magic. These powers are unique to Mindcrafters, and vary 
  from simple extrasensory powers to mental domination of others. Since 
  these powers are developed by the practice of certain disciplines, a 
  Mindcrafter requires no spellbooks to use them. The available powers 
  are simply determined by the character's level. Wisdom determines a 
  Mindcrafter's ability to use mind powers.
   
  Mindcrafters gain new mindcrafting powers and their existing ones 
  become stronger as they gain levels. They can use their power even 
  when blinded. They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which allows 
  them to rapidly regenerate their mana.

  Mirror-Master
  Mirror-Masters are spell casters; like other mages, they must live by 
  their wits. They can create magical mirrors, and employ them in the 
  casting of Mirror-Magic spells. Intelligence determines a 
  Mirror-Master's spell casting ability.
   
  Mirror-Masters gain more spells and each spell becomes more powerful 
  as they gain levels. They can use their spells even when blinded. For 
  Mirror-Masters, the arrangement of mirrors is very important: Some 
  attack spells reflect from mirrors, and some other spells are 
  effective only against monsters standing on a mirror. A Mirror-Master 
  standing on a mirror has greater ability and, for example, can 
  perform quick teleports. The maximum number of magical Mirrors which 
  can be controlled simultaneously depends on the level, and breaking 
  unnecessary mirrors is important work for them. They have two class 
  powers - 'Break Mirrors', which breaks all mirrors in current dungeon 
  level and 'Mirror Concentration', which allows them to rapidly 
  regenerate their mana on a mirror.

  Psion
  The Psion is like a Mindcrafter, and uses innate mental powers. 
  Unlike the Mindcrafter, however, Psions have the freedom to learn 
  powers that enforce their own styles. They learn very few powers, but 
  they can scale their powers to determine the SP cost and the powers' 
  potency. Psionic powers require great concentration, however, and 
  psions do not have the mind to spare to care for others. The Psion 
  gains powers a the following levels: 1, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 40 and 
  50. The Psion uses Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma as their primary 
  spell stat, which ever is currently highest. In this respect, Psions 
  are truly unique!

  Time-Lord
  Time-Lords are masters of temporal magic, altering the flow of time 
  to their advantage. They don't learn spells from books, but rather 
  gain new powers as they grow more experienced. They are the only 
  class that can affect monsters with time based attacks. Not only do 
  these damage their foes, but they also inflict a wide variety of 
  possible effects, from slowing to amnesia, from evolution to 
  devolution, from weakening to stasis. In addition to temporal 
  attacks, the Time-Lord gains great powers of speed, and they grow 
  faster with experience. It is said that masters of time can even see 
  the future, avoiding attacks that would otherwise prove fatal! Also, 
  legend has it that the greatest Time-Lords are able to take multiple 
  actions in a single turn.
   
  Time-Lords are mediocre fighters and not good at archery at all. They 
  are OK with magical devices, but nowhere near as proficient as are 
  mages. They have midling stealth. At high levels, they become 
  resistant to time. The Time-Lord's primary magic stat is Wisdom.

  Warlock
  A Warlock is a magical class but, unlike normal spellcasters, they 
  derive their powers, stats, skills and bonuses by making a pact with 
  a given class of monsters. This pact is irrevocable and is made at 
  the outset of the Warlock's career. Depending on the class of 
  monsters with whom they ally, the warlock will gain unique bonuses, 
  abilities and magical powers. For example, alliance with the forces 
  of the netherworld grants resistances to poison and nether, enhanced 
  constitution and spells to control and conjure the unliving as well 
  as spells to access the damaging forces of the netherworld directly. 
  Each such alliance has thematic bonuses and powers, and you can read 
  the details in the respective help sections. On final comment: 
  allying with a given class of monsters dramatically reduces the 
  warlock's ability to fight these foes. Instead, the warlock seeks 
  cooperation with their brethren, or, perhaps, domination over them. 
  But direct assaults are rarely successful.
   
  In addition to pact related spells, all warlocks gain access to the 
  unique power of the Eldritch Blast. Their primary spell stat is 
  Charisma since they seek dominion and alliance with their chosen kin, 
  and these monsters tend to have a strong will of their own, resisting 
  the binding forces which the warlock imposes to gain both mastery and 
  power.
  
  See [f] for more details on warlock pacts.

  Archaeologist
  The Archaeologist is an erudite treasure hunter, seeking out the most 
  valuable prizes that the dungeon has to offer. At home in 
  subterranean caverns and vaults, he is rarely lost or snared in 
  traps. His powers of perception and detection are very great, as is 
  his skill with arcane devices. At high levels he can use the dark 
  magic of the entombed Pharaohs. The powers of the Archaeologist are 
  enhanced by Wisdom.

  Bard
  Bards are something like traditional musicians. Their magical attacks 
  are sound-based, and last as long as the Bard has mana. Although a 
  bard cannot sing two or more songs at the same time, he or she does 
  have the advantage that many songs affect all areas in sight. A 
  bard's prime statistic is charisma.
   
  The songs are found in four songbooks, of which two are sold in town. 
  There is a special feature of music; many songs continue to be sung 
  until either the Bard chooses to stop, or he runs out of the energy 
  required to sing that type of song. Bards have a class power - 'Stop 
  Singing'.

  Rage-Mage
  The Rage Mage is part of a secret sect descending from the Barbarians 
  in response to their natural foes, the mages. As time passed, other 
  races have also begun to learn their arts. The powers of the Rage 
  Mage are spells learned from books, but they don't work the way 
  normal spells do. First of all, the Rage Mage must perform a special 
  Ritual of Anger to learn a spell, and this ritual destroys the spell 
  book in the process. As a result, it may take a long time for the 
  Rage Mage to learn all of their high level powers. Once learned, the 
  Rage Mage no longers requires the spell book in order to perform the 
  power.
   
  Another unique aspect of the Rage Mage concerns their Mana pool. 
  Unlike normal spellcasters, the Rage Mage's mana does not regenerate 
  on its own. In fact, their mana actually decreases rapidly each turn, 
  meaning that they had better use their powers quickly while they 
  still can. The Rage Mage gains mana whenever he is the target of a 
  magical spell. Indeed, magic makes the Rage Mage very angry! The Rage 
  Mage can also fuel their mana by hurting those around them. This can 
  be quite effective in crowded situations.

  Skillmaster
  The Skillmaster is not your ordinary class. Instead, you may design 
  your own class, on the fly, using a point based skill system. Upon 
  birth, you will get 5 points to spend and you should use these wisely 
  to set the basic direction of your class. Upon gaining every fifth 
  level, you will receive an additional point to spend, for fifteen 
  points overall. You may use these points to learn melee or to gain 
  access to spell realms. You can improve your speed or your stealth. 
  Or you may gain increased magic device skills. In addition, you may 
  learn riding skills, dual wielding or even martial arts. You will 
  have a lot of flexibility in how you choose to play this class.
   
  Most skills allow the investment of multiple points for increased 
  proficiency, but some are abilities that you may buy with a single 
  point (e.g. Luck). This class is not recommended for beginning or 
  immediate players. You only have a limited amount of points to spend, 
  and your choices are irreversible.
  
  See [g] for more details on skillmasters.

  Wild-Talent
  The Wild-Talent gains random talents and abilities as they level up. 
  They are good fighters, and decent with magical devices, but their 
  true forte is their vast array of potential random powers. Except you 
  never know what those might be!
   
  Wild-Talents do not have a spell stat. Instead, each ability that 
  they gain requires its own individual stat for purposes of fail rate 
  calculation. For example, Tossing a Boulder requires Strength while 
  Magic Missile requires Intelligence. Each spell requires mana to 
  cast, but the amount of mana available is not influenced by any 
  particular stat and is simply determined by experience.
