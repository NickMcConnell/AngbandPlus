Demigod Parentage

The term demigod is commonly used to describe mythological figures 
whose one parent was a god and whose other parent was human; as such, 
demigods are human-god hybrids and are quite powerful. Demigods receive 
special abilities depending on their parentage.

Athena
Athena is the great goddess of wisdom and the protector of Athens. She 
was born of Zeus and the Titan Metis, and her cunning far surpasses 
that of the other deities. You inherit great clarity of thought and 
magic and will be able to cast spells more reliably than other mortals. 
And should you fail to cast a spell, you will pay a reduced casting 
cost rather than the full amount. You also have a firm grip on your 
mental prowess.

Ares
Ares is the bold son of Zeus and Hera, whose very name is feared and 
respected by warriors and citizens alike. His legendary combat prowess 
exceeds that of Zeus and Poseidon, but he is less skilled in wiles than 
the other Olympians. You inherit exceptional bonuses to combat and have 
a firm grip on your strength. Later in life, you will be able to fly 
into a berserk rage on command. However, your lust for combat decreases 
your stealth as you call out challenges to all that you meet. And your 
resistance to magic is suspect as well.

Hermes
Hermes, the Messenger, is the extremely cunning diplomat used by the 
Olympians to negotiate truces. With his Winged Sandals and his powerful 
magic, there is no place barred from him, and there is no way to detain 
him. You inherit great powers of motion and will never become slowed. 
Your stealth is better than your brethren and your speed will increase 
with experience.

Hephaestus
Hephaestus was the god of technology, blacksmiths, craftsmen, artisans, 
sculptors, metals, metallurgy, fire and volcanoes. Like other mythic 
smiths but unlike most other gods, Hephaestus was lame, which gave him

the gods. You inherit powers of enchantment and protection. Your 
equipment will not suffer diminution by corrosion or magical attack.

Aphrodite
Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and 
procreation. You inherit her sex appeal. As such, your pets are more 
obedient and shopkeepers fawn over you in their efforts to please you.

slavish devotion, though sometimes this just angers them.
