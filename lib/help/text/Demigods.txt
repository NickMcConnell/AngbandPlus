Athena
Athena is the great goddess of wisdom and the protector of Athens. She 
was born of Zeus and the Titan Metis, and her cunning far surpasses 
that of the other deities. You inherit great clarity of thought and 
magic and will be able to cast spells more reliably than other mortals. 
And should you fail to cast a spell, you will pay a reduced casting 
cost rather than the full amount. You also have a firm grip on your 
mental prowess.

respected by warriors and citizens alike. His legendary combat prowess 
exceeds that of Zeus and Poseidon, but he is less skilled in wiles than 
the other Olympians. You inherit exceptional bonuses to combat and have 
a firm grip on your strength. Later in life, you will be able to fly 
into a berserk rage on command. However, your lust for combat decreases 
your stealth as you call out challenges to all that you meet. And your 
resistance to magic is suspect as well.

Your stealth is better than your brethren and your speed will increase 
with experience.

Aphrodite
Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and 
procreation. You inherit her sex appeal. As such, your pets are more 
obedient and shopkeepers fawn over you in their efforts to please you.

slavish devotion, though sometimes this just angers them.
