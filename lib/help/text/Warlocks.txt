Warlocks

Warlocks are a magical class; they derive their spells and powers not 
from books, but from an eldritch pact made with a given class of 
monsters. This pact is irrevocable and is made at the outset of the 
Warlock's career. Depending on the class of monsters with whom they 
ally, the warlock will gain unique bonuses, abilities and magical 
powers; for example, alliance with the forces of the netherworld grants 
resistances to poison and nether, enhanced constitution and spells to 
control and conjure the unliving, as well as spells to access the 
damaging forces of the netherworld directly. Each such alliance has 
thematic bonuses and powers, and you can read the details in the 
respective help sections.

Allying with a given class of monsters dramatically reduces the 
warlock's ability to fight these foes. Instead, the warlock seeks 
cooperation with their brethren, or perhaps domination over them; 
direct assaults are rarely successful.
 
In addition to pact-related spells, all warlocks gain access to the 
unique power of the Eldritch Blast. Their primary spell stat is 
Charisma, since they seek dominion and alliance with their chosen kin, 
and these monsters tend to have a strong will of their own.

Undead
The undead are tough creatures, each having already survived death at 
least once. Warlocks who make a pact with Undead will find themselves 
gaining additional resistances such as cold, poison, darkness and 
nether. In addition, they will be able to see invisible monsters and 
gain resistance to life-draining forces. They will also gain access to 
undeadly powers, which typically involve detection and control over the 
forces of the netherworld. Eventually, this pact will allow its 
practitioners to destroy monsters with a single word, and, perhaps, to 
even partially leave the world of the living altogether. Of course, 
allying with the undead substantially reduces the warlock's ability to 
fight these creatures.

Dragons
The bond between a Dragonrider and a Dragon is one of the strongest and 
most enduring ties seen the world over. Each draws strength, power, and 
encouragement from the other, and together they make a formidable foe. 
An alliance with Dragonkind enables this bond to form, and the Warlock 
of this pact gains impressive powers for mounted combat. Indeed, they 
are among the elite riders of the world, only slightly inferior to 
Cavalry and Beastmasters. But where they have a slight deficiency in 
skill (and perhaps in melee as well), they have a strong advantage in 
riding techniques and magical enhancements. Dragonriders favor the 
lance above all other weapons, and seek continuously the legendary 
'Dragonlance' which they view as their long-lost birthright.

Archons
Archons are astral beings who use a variety of techniques to smite 
those they view as evil. Warlocks who make pacts with Archons will also 
find their saving throws significantly improved, and (eventually) their 
body almost immune to bolt-like effects. Since Archons are strongly 
aligned with the forces of good, making a pact with Archons will reduce 
damage done to all good monsters by a substantial amount.

Demons
Demons are crafty creatures of Hell, using whatever means at their 
disposal to bring down their enemies. Warlocks who make pacts with 
Demons will find their abilities to use all magical devices improved, 
and learn the ability to Recharge these devices at will. Eventually, 
Demon Warlocks attain the ability to crush walls beneath their 
footsteps, and even gain immunity to fire. Making a pact with Demons 
will reduce damage done to all demons by a substantial amount.

Hounds
An alliance with hounds is sneakily strong: hounds are fast, stealthy 
and nimble, and the warlock will gain these attributes as well, in 
addition to basic elemental resistances. They also gain decent melee, 
and the ability to channel the unpredictable powers of the aether. Of 
course, Hound Warlocks may also call on their kin for assistance, 
though this may not be enough against the more difficult foes of the 
world. Still, wouldn't it be fun to have some of those annoying hounds 
on your side for a change?

Spiders
Of all the icky, crawling things in the world, you have chosen to make 
an alliance with spiders? Sure, they are stealthy, and fast, and very 
adept at hiding. Able to extrude a fine sticky substance to ensnare the 
unwary, the spider lurks nearby, or so you assume since you very seldom 
see them. Moreover, many spiders are adept at the powers of 
teleportation, able to jump quickly from one location to another, which 
can be quite baffling to a would be predator. They are comfortable with 
both poison and nexus. They are a bit on the squishy side, though - 
that is, if you manage to catch one!

Giants
An alliance with giants and titans grants impressive physical strength 
and fortitude, but other stats will generally suffer. Later in life, 
you will gain giant-like resistances including sound, shards and chaos. 
Your combat will be impressive; and like giants, you will favor heavy 
weapons. Oh, and you won't mind tossing a boulder or two should the 
need arise! This alliance offers much in the way of physical 
advantages, but very little in the way of magical abilities or skill. 
Warlocks with this alliance are excellent fighters, being nearly 
indistiguishable in skill from Warriors!
