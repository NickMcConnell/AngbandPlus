Draconians

Draconians are a humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. There are 
several subtypes of draconians with different resistances, breaths and 
attributes. For example, Red Draconians are resistant to fire which 
they may also breathe at will, while White Draconians breathe and 
resist cold instead. All draconians levitate. In addition, when they 
mature enough, they may choose a special draconian power.

Red
Red Draconians have an affinity for fire, which they both breathe at 
will and resist. Together with their White kin, they are the strongest 
in combat of the draconians. But they are not so good with magic and 
their stealth is quite poor. Should they choose the power of Dragon 
Skin, they will gain a fiery aura as well. Should they choose the power 
of Dragon Strike, their blows will burn their enemies.

Bronze
Bronze Draconians are the most intelligent of their kind, and the best 
with magic as well. They are seldom confused, though the same may not 
be said of their enemies. With the power of Dragon Strike, even the 
melee attacks of the Bronze Draconian will baffle their enemies.

Crystal
Hard of skin, the Crystal Draconian is difficult to hit in melee. But 
their agility suffers and they are not the brightest of their kind. 
They resist shards, which they may also breathe on command. With the 
power of Dragon Skin, they gain an aura of shards as well. With the 
power of Dragon Strike, even their melee attacks will shred their 
enemies.

Gold
The wisest of their kind, Gold Draconians are resilient in the face of 
magical attacks. They are resistant to sound which they may also 
breathe at will, stunning their enemies. With the power of Dragon 
Strike, even their melee attacks will stun their enemies.

Shadow
Lithe, stealthy and nimble, the Shadow Draconian is seldom seen in this 
world. They are resistant to the forces of nether which they may also 
breathe. They are the weakest of the draconians, and the poorest in 
melee. But they are better than average with magic. With the power of 
Dragon Strike, they may steal life from their enemies in melee.
