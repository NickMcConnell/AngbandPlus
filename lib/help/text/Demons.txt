Demons

Demons are powerful servants of evil and come in many forms. Being 
monsters, they may not choose a normal class. Instead, they rely on 
their devilish powers or their brutish strength to survive.
 
The various demonic races include the Balrog, powerful demons of fire; 
the Sevants of Khorne, mighty warriors of destruction; the Tanar'ri, 
weaker demons whose ultimate form has three sets of arms, but prefers 
to fight naked; and Cyberdemons, whose firepower is unsurpassable.
 
All demon races cannot eat normal food, but must feast upon the remains 
of their human enemies. They are unaffected by the Eldritch Horror.

Balrog
Balrogs are demons of shadow and flame. Their evil knows no bounds. 
Their spells are the most powerful of all demonkind and at very high 
levels they may even call forth fires directly from hell.

Tanar'ri
Tanar'ri were originally slave demons, but rose up to overthrow their 
masters. They generally take on a humanoid form and are classic demons 
full of malice and cruelty. The ultimate form for this demon is the 
Marilith, a female demon with three sets of arms and a serpent body 
capable of attacking with six melee weapons!

Servant of Khorne
Khorne's servants come in many forms and are powerful forces of melee. 
They know nothing save melee, and strike at all that dare oppose the 
will of their master. As they gain experience, Khorne rewards his 
servants with new and more powerful forms.

Cyberdemon
Cyberdemons are giant humanoid forms, half demon and half machine. They 
are a bit slow and move erratically, but their immense bodies and 
unsurpassable firepower more than make up for this. The walls of the 
dungeon reverberate with their heavy steps!
