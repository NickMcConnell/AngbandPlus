Options and Effects

Most of the options are accessible through the = command, which 
provides an interface to the various sets of options available to the 
player.

In the descriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary 
which is shown on the options screen, plus the internal name of the 
option in parenthesis, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref 
files to force the option to a given setting (see [a] for more info).

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including 
disturb (cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are 
in progress), flush (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress 
queue, including any macros in progress), and fresh (dump any pending 
output to the screen).

Birth options

The birth options can only be accessed while creating a new character 
(press = while creating the character). There is no way to turn them 
off after the creation is finished!
  
  Monsters learn from their mistakes (smart_learn)
  Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to, and 
  to use this information to choose the best attacks.
  
  Monsters exploit players weaknesses (smart_cheat)
  Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, and 
  to use this information to choose the best attacks.
  
  
Input Options
  
  Rogue-like commands (rogue_like_commands)
  Selects the roguelike command set which is an alternative way of 
  mapping keystrokes to underlying game commands. (see [b] for info).
  
  Pick things up by default (always_pickup)
  Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it 
  up. Otherwise, you must use the g command, or the - command while 
  walking. Combined with carry_query_flag, allows you to selectively 
  pick up all items which you step on.
  
  Activate quick messages (quick_messages)
  Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the -more- prompt 
  (useful for monster farming). Allows most keys to mean "no" to any 
  "(y/n)" prompt.
  
  Enable command selection menu (command_menu)
  The command selection menu is a helpful tool for beginning players. 
  By pressing ENTER, this option displays a menu of all available 
  commands, which the user may drill into with the arrow keys. This 
  makes it easier to discover the keypress required to do a specific 
  action:
  
    +----------------------------------------------------+
    |   Magic/Special         > Action                   |
    |   Item+----------------------------------------------------+
    |   Equi| > Rest(R)                 Disarm a trap(D)         |
    |   Info|   Search(s)               Look(l/x)                |
    |   Othe|   Target(*)               Dig(T/^t)                |
    +-------|   Enter global map(<)     Go down stairs(>)        |
            |   Command pets(p)         Search mode ON/OFF(S/#)  |
            +----------------------------------------------------+
  
  
  Use old target by default (use_old_target)
  This option forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to 
  use the current target if there is one. Use of this option can be 
  dangerous if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear 
  them when done. Actually, position targets now automatically clear 
  when they are no longer valid (e.g. after a teleport). Pay attention 
  to the character info section of your screen as it always shows your 
  current target, whether monster or location.
  
  Automatically target nearest monster (auto_target)
  With this option enabled, every offensive spell you cast or device 
  you use will automatically target the closest monster if there is not 
  already a valid target selected. If you use this option, then it is 
  highly recommended that you also enable the use_old_target option. 
  That way, if you are in a situation where the automatic targeting is 
  not what you want, you can just select a target up front before 
  casting your spell.
  
  Repeat obvious commands (always_repeat)
  Tells the game that when you attempt to open a door or chest, bash a 
  door, tunnel through walls, or disarm traps or chests, that you wish 
  to repeat the command 99 times (see [c]).
  
  Prompt for destruction of known worthless items (confirm_destroy)
  Normally, no confirmation will be asked if you attempt to destroy an 
  object which you know to be worthless. If this option is set, the 
  Destroy command always asks for confirmation.
  
  Confirm to wear/wield known cursed items (confirm_wear)
  Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find 
  themselves wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this option 
  is set, you should be safe from such typing mistakes: you will be 
  prompted if you attempt to wear or wield an item if your character 
  knows it is cursed.
  
  Allow targetting pets (target_pet)
  Normally, the program doesn't automatically choose pets as target in 
  the targeting mode of attack spells. If this option is set, the 
  program always chooses every monster in sight as target.
  
  Automatically open doors (easy_open)
  Makes it easy for your character to open a door: simply by walking 
  into it! Also the open command will automatically select one 
  direction if only one door is near you.
  
  Automatically disarm traps (easy_disarm)
  Makes it easy for your character disarms a trap: simply by walking 
  into it! Also the disarm command will automatically select one 
  direction if only one known trap is near you.
  
  Automatically get nearby ammo (auto_get_ammo)
  This option instructs the Auto-Get Objects command (^G) to 
  automatically travel to nearby, visible ammo which is inscribed with 
  =g (i.e., ammo which you have instructed the autopicker to 
  automatically pickup). This enhancement is useful for archer builds 
  after all nearby monsters have been slain. You might consider using 
  the stronger auto_get_objects option instead.
  
  Automatically get nearby objects (auto_get_objects)
  This option instructs the Auto-Get Objects command (^G) to 
  automatically travel to nearby visible objects which you have 
  registered to either pickup or destroy. This option subsumes (and 
  extends) the auto_get_ammo option since ammo inscribed with =g is 
  certainly registered for auto-pickup.
  
  Automatically detect traps while running (auto_detect_traps)
  With this option enabled, the game will attempt to automatically 
  detect traps whenever you run outside a trap-detected region. Use the 
  view_unsafe_grids to make trap detected regions more visually 
  obvious. For this option to work, you must be carrying a scroll, 
  staff or rod able to detect traps. The game will use the object for 
  you automatically, consuming a scroll or a single charge from an 
  appropriate device.
  
  Use numpad keys as cursor keys in editor mode (numpad_as_cursorkey)
  This option makes numpad keys work as cursor movement keys while text 
  editing mode. Which include auto-picker editor, inputing an 
  inscription, a macro action, and etc.
  
  Use and Display Inventory Slots (use_pack_slots)
  With this option, the object prompt will use and display the current 
  inventory slot for objects in question. For example, if your food 
  happens to currently be in slot h), the the Eat command will require 
  you to press h to use this item. Without this option, each object 
  prompt will begin labels at a). Some players prefer to keep the 
  inventory slot, even though it constantly shifts as you add and 
  remove new objects to your pack. Other players prefer to have 
  commands use the same labels for the same objects upon successive 
  calls (For example, pick up a spellbook and your food is now in the 
  i) slot. This may puzzle you, since the last time you were hungry you 
  pressed Eh, but now you need to press Ei. With this option turned 
  off, eating rations of food will always be Ea ... at least until you 
  pick up some mushrooms! However, if you do, then your eye will 
  quickly perceive the presence of two items in the object prompt next 
  time you Eat).
  
Map & Screen Options
  
  Center map while walking (center_player)
  With this option enabled, the map window automatically recenters on 
  the player as you walk. I find this rather disturbing, but it helps 
  if you are on a small monitor and worried about off screen monsters.
  
  Centering even while running (center_running)
  Normally, the map does not center on the player if the player moves 
  with the "run" command, only when the running finishes. If this 
  option is set, the map always centers on the player.
  
  Use special graphics for lighting (view_light)
  This option causes special graphics to be used to indicate the 
  lighting level. Lighting is a super-position of player light (or 
  darkness), monster light (or darkness) and terrain light (or 
  darkness). This option is further refined by sub-options to "View 
  Daylight" (not recommended) and to "View Grid Light", both described 
  below.
  
  Use special graphics for surface daylight (view_daylight)
  Enabling this option will include surface daylight in the lighting 
  level for displaying special graphical lighting with the view_light 
  option. It is not recommended. In the daytime, the surface level has 
  an ambient ligthing level of 5 which is quite bright and washes out 
  any further lighting effects (for example, the player's torch or a 
  shopkeeper's entrance).
  
  Use special graphics for lit rooms (view_gridlight)
  Enabling this option will include room lighting in the lighting level 
  for displaying special graphical lighting with the view_light option. 
  There are situations when this information is important (e.g. 
  Vampires and Ninjas). You may also prefer this display but I usually 
  disable this option. Without it, there is no display difference 
  between a lit room and an un-lit room.
  
    Lighting options work best when playing with graphics 
    enabled since we currently have terrain graphics for 
    lighting levels between -5 and +5 inclusive (and more 
    can be added). For ASCII display, the game can only 
    indicate darkness (light < 0), lack of light (light = 
    0) and presence of light (light > 0) providing less 
    useful information. Also, some terrain does not 
    indicate lighting at all in ASCII mode, and the 
    presence of a monster, the player or an object will 
    hide the lighting display of the underlying terrain.
  
  Map remembers all perma-lit grids (view_perma_grids)
  Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player. This 
  option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids were 
  perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids, 
  unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids. Turning off this option 
  allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line of 
  sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite" 
  option. Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player are 
  always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is 
  memorized independently from the memorization of the grid itself.
  
  Map remembers all torch-lit grids (view_torch_grids)
  Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player. 
  This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids 
  have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use 
  of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display of 
  floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray","lit" 
  grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite" option is 
  set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in 
  "orange". Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit" are 
  considered to be "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless the 
  "view_yellow_lite" option is set, in which case they are drawn in 
  "yellow".
  
  Map marked by detect traps (view_unsafe_grids)
  Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a 
  detect trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This 
  allows you to determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect 
  traps, but does not ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x' are 
  trap free. This option has no effect on surface grids, but outdoor 
  locations cannot be trapped.
  
  Flush output while continuous command (fresh_before)
  This option forces the game to flush all output before every command. 
  This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game 
  somewhat. Note that this option is only useful when using macros, 
  resting, running, or repeating commands, since the output is always 
  flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the user.
  
  Flush output after monster's move (fresh_after)
  This option forces the game to flush all output after not only every 
  player command, but also after every round of processing monsters and 
  objects, which will give you maximal information, but may slow down 
  the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on faster machines 
  you normally do not have a chance to see the results anyway.
  
  Flush output after every message (fresh_message)
  This option forces the game to flush all output after every message 
  displayed by the game. This will give you maximal information, but 
  may slow down the game somewhat.
  
  Hilite the player with the cursor (hilite_player)
  Place the visible cursor on the player. This looks fine on some Unix 
  machines, but horrible on most graphics machines. Note that only some 
  machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, 
  hiding the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.
  
  Display actual path before shooting (display_path)
  When this option is set, the targeting mode will show path from you 
  to current target point continuously.
  
Text Display Options
  
  Plain object descriptions (plain_descriptions)
  This option disables "full" names for identified 'flavored' objects, 
  in other words, if this option is not in use, an identified Potion of 
  Speed could be listed (for example) as a Blue Potion of Speed. If you 
  prefer simpler, less verbose descriptions, set this option.
  
  Always show list when choosing items (always_show_list)
  When this option is set, all commands which lets you to choose an 
  item from inventory or equipment list will automatically show list 
  when activated.
  
  Show dungeon level in feet (depth_in_feet)
  Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as an actual level. 
  This also affects the monster memory display.
  
  Show labels in object listings (show_labels)
  Display the labels for objects in the equipment list, and in any 
  special window which is displaying the equipment. These labels 
  indicate what the player is using the object for, such as "wielding" 
  or "wearing" (in a given location). After you have played for a 
  while, this information is no longer useful, and can be annoying.
  
  Show weights in object listings (show_weights)
  Display the weights of objects in the inventory and equipment lists, 
  and in stores, and in any special window which is displaying any of 
  these lists.
  
  Show discounts in object listings (show_discounts)
  Display the discount of the object, if any, as part of its 
  inscription. Disabling this option won't remove the object's 
  discount. Rather, this information will no longer be displayed to the 
  player.
  
  Show items graphics (show_item_graph)
  Displays small icons of the items in your inventory list, equipment 
  list and stores.
  
  Display 'equippy' chars (equippy_chars)
  This option will show you a graphical representation of your worn 
  equipment on the main screen. The 'equippy' chars will use the 
  standard symbols of the respective items.
  
  Display player hp bar (display_hp_bar)
  This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current health. For example:
    @ 52%
  
  Display player sp bar (display_sp_bar)
  This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current mana. For example:
    ?  3%
  
  Display detailed food status (display_food_bar)
  This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current state of hunger. For example:
    , 15%
  
  Compress messages in savefiles (compress_savefile)
  Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages" that 
  the player has received. This can cut the size of the savefile by a 
  drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.
  
  Describe obj's extra resistances by abbreviation (abbrev_extra)
  When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string 
  for the object's extra resitances and extra abilities are added as 
  fake inscriptions of the object.
  
  A word "EXTRA" means that the ability must not be obvious from the 
  objects name. For example, a pair of boots of Levitation sometimes 
  has EXTRA shard resistance. But fire resistance of an armor of Resist 
  Fire is not an EXTRA resistance.
  
  The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are 
  described in [d].
  
  Describe obj's all resistances by abbreviation (abbrev_all)
  When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string 
  for all the object's resitances and abilities are added as fake 
  inscriptions of the object.
  
  The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are 
  described in [e].
  
  Show the experience needed for the next level (exp_need)
  Setting this option to yes alters the display of experience on the 
  left of the main screen to the experience needed to reach the next 
  character level, instead of the character's current total experience.
  
  Ignore actions of out of sight monsters (ignore_unview)
  With this option, you won't receive messages when out of sight 
  monsters fight one another. This is useful if you are playing with 
  lots of pets and don't wish to read a blow by blow account of the 
  battle raging around you.
  
  Player character depends on their race (display_race)
  With this option a player who plays as a Quylthulg, for example, will 
  be represented by a Q. If the option is turned off the player will 
  always be @. 
  
Game Play Options
  
  Merge inscriptions when stacking (stack_force_notes)
  Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty 
  inscription and the other does not. The resulting stack keeps the 
  non-empty inscription.
  
  Merge discounts when stacking (stack_force_costs)
  Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have 
  different discounts. The resulting stack keeps the largest discount. 
  This option may cause you to lose "value", but will give you optimal 
  pack usage.
  
  Expand the power of the list commands (expand_list)
  Expand the "listing" commands so that they "wrap" at the "edges" of 
  the appropriate list. This allows the "look" and "target" commands to 
  "cycle" through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify 
  symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.
  
  Leave last words when your character dies (last_words)
  Display a random line from the "death.txt" file when your character 
  dies and then allow you to rewrite these last words. If this option 
  is not selected, the "You die." message is displayed instead.
  
  Allow use of debug/cheat options (allow_debug_opts)
  Since use of debug command(^A), wizard mode(^W), and Cheating options 
  ('C' in options panel) mark the player as "Cheater" who can't 
  register their score, these debug/cheat options are forbidden by 
  default. The allow_debug_opts option removes these restrictions, and 
  allow the player to become "Cheater". But perhaps you just want to 
  test?
  
Disturbance Options
  
  Run past stairs (find_ignore_stairs)
  Ignore stairs when running.
  
  Run through open doors (find_ignore_doors)
  Ignore open doors when running.
  
  Run past known corners (find_cut)
  Cut sharply around known corners when running. This will result in 
  faster running, but may cause you to run into a lurking monster.
  
  Check for user abort while continuous command (check_abort)
  Turning this option off will avoid checking to see if the user has 
  pressed a key during resting or running or repeated commands. This 
  not only makes the game much more efficient (on many systems), but 
  also allows the use of certain obscure macro sequences, such as 
  turning this option off, resting until done, turning this option on, 
  and casting a spell. Resting for long periods of time with this 
  option turned off is dangerous since the resting may not stop until 
  the user takes damage from starvation.
  
  Flush input on various failures (flush_failure)
  This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever 
  various "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to 
  use a wand, etc. This is very useful if you use macros which include 
  "directional" components with commands that can fail, since it will 
  prevent you from walking towards monsters when your spells fail.
  
  Flush input whenever disturbed (flush_disturb)
  This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the 
  character is "disturbed". This is useful if you use macros which take 
  time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while 
  being attacked by a monster.
  
  Disturb whenever any monster moves (disturb_move)
  Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears. 
  This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so 
  you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near 
  such monsters.
  
  Disturb whenever high-level monster moves (disturb_high)
  Disturb the player when any monster whose level is higher than the 
  player moves, appears, or disappears. This includes monsters which 
  are only visible due to telepathy.
  
  Disturb whenever viewable monster moves (disturb_near)
  Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any 
  monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any 
  viewable monster becomes no longer viewable. This option ignores the 
  existence of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether a 
  monster is "viewable". See also the "view_reduce_view" option.
  
  Disturb when visible pets move (disturb_pets)
  The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not apply 
  to pets: for example, it can be annoying if your rest is always 
  disturbed by a pet dog who pops in every now and then. By default, 
  pets do not disturb you even if full monster disturbance options are 
  set. If you want your pets to disturb you like normal monsters, set 
  this option.
  
  Disturb whenever map panel changes (disturb_panel)
  This option causes you to be disturbed by the map scrolling, as it 
  does automatically when you get close to the edge of the screen.
  
  Disturb whenever player state changes (disturb_state)
  This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state 
  changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.
  
  Disturb whenever boring things happen (disturb_minor)
  This option causes you to be disturbed by various bring things, 
  including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and 
  beginning to run out of fuel.
  
  Audible bell (on errors, etc) (ring_bell)
  Attempt to make a bell noise when various errors occur.
  
  Disturb when leaving trap detected area (disturb_trap_detect)
  This option causes you to be disturbed when the player is running out 
  of trap-detected area.
  
  Alert when leaving trap detected area (alert_trap_detect)
  This option alerts you with message when the player is moving out of 
  the trap-detected area.
  
Easy Auto-Destroyer Options
  
  Use easy auto-destroyer (destroy_items)
  This option turns The Easy Destroyer on and off. If enabled, The Easy 
  Destroyer will destroy all objects unless the object is protected by 
  one or more of the leave_* options discussed below.
  
    Note: The Easy Auto-Destroyer is a simpler to use 
    version of the full featured Mogaminator discussed in 
    [f]. It is designed for those who feel the full version 
    is too complicated to use. However, you really should 
    only use one or the other. So if you are using the full 
    version, then you should not also enable the easy 
    version.
  
  Apply auto-destroy on sensing an item (destroy_feeling)
  If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy 
  Destroyer will take actions whenever the player senses the quality of 
  an object (i.e., whenever pseudo-id kicks in).
  
  Apply auto-destroy on identifying an item (destroy_identify)
  If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy 
  Destroyer will take actions whenever the player identifies an object, 
  whether with a spell or with a magical device (but, alas, not via a 
  town service).
  
  List the rule used when applying the Mogaminator (destroy_debug)
  This is a debugging option when using the full-featured Mogaminator. 
  Enabling this option results in the reporting of the rule used 
  whenever an action is taken, such as pickup, auto-identify or 
  destroy. The rule in question will appear in the message line. For 
  example:
    You have 26 charges remaining. (AutoID:~?unidentified rods) You see a 
    Rod: Frost Ball (1/3 charges). (Destroy:(!rods:frost ball$)
    Auto-destroying.
  
  In addition, the matching rule will be displayed when inspecting 
  objects. For example:
    an Amulet (Defender) [+12]
      Resist Acid, Electricity, Fire, Cold, Poison
      Free Action; See Invisible; Levitation
      It cannot be harmed by the elements.
      Autopick: ~*identified* amulets more value than 10000
    
  Auto-destroyer leaves known worthy items (leave_worth)
  This option protects known objects that can be sold in stores from auto-destru
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves weapons and armour (leave_equip)
  This option protects all weapons and armour from auto-destruction by The Easy
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves closed chests (leave_chest)
  This option protects all chests which are not yet opened from auto-destruction
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves wanted corpses (leave_wanted)
  This option protects corpses of monsters wanted at the Hunter's office from au
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves corpses and skeletons (leave_corpse)
  This option protects all corpses and skeletons from auto-destruction by The Ea
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves junk (leave_junk)
  This option protects all 'junk', such as Shards of Pottery or Broken Stick, fr
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves items your race/class needs (leave_special)
  This option protects specific items which are normally worthless, but very imp
  
  Delay Factor
  
  Delay Factors, if non-zero, are used to slow down the game, which is 
  useful to allow you to observe the animations of bolt, beam, and ball 
  attacks. The game now prompts you for two separate delay factors. The 
  first, called the Animation Delay, is applied whenever the game is 
  animating an effect, such as a player's fire ball spell or a dragon's 
  deadly breath. The second, called the Running Delay, is applied 
  whenever the player is using the run or travel commands. Computers 
  have simply become too fast, and you will need to slow down running, 
  especially in the wilderness. Enter values in milliseconds.
  
  Hitpoint Warning
  
  The hitpoint_warn value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal 
  hitpoints at which the player is warned that he may die. It is also 
  used as the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.
  
  Autosave Options
  
  Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not 
  needed at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which 
  it, to be frank, probably is not), the user might forget to save and 
  his hardware could fail him. For all of these reasons, you may want 
  to use these options:
    
    Autosave when entering new levels (autosave_l)
    If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your 
    character every time before creating a new dungeon level.
    
    Timed autosave (autosave_t)
    If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your 
    character every n game turns, where n is the "frequency". To set 
    the frequency press F. It will increase the frequency to the next 
    category (and from 25000 to 0), the categories being every 50, 100, 
    250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 and 25000 turns. Note that the 
    frequency must be higher than 0 and the "Timed autosave" set to 
    "yes" for timed autosaves to take place.
    
  Window Flags
  
  These options select what kind of information is displayed in which 
  window. Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which 
  can be used to display useful information generally available through 
  other means. The best thing about these windows is that they are 
  updated automatically (usually) to reflect the current state of the 
  world. The "window options" can be used to specify what should be 
  displayed in each window. The possible choices should be pretty 
  obvious.
    
    Display inven/equip
    Display the player inventory (and sometimes the equipment). Note 
    that you can toggle between Inventory and Equipment by pressing ^I.
    
    Display equip/inven
    Display the player equipment (and sometimes the inventory). Note 
    that you can toggle between Inventory and Equipment by pressing ^I.
    
    Display World Map
    Displays the surface map. Since the player must learn the 
    wilderness layout through exploration, this is a very useful 
    display option. You can also access the world map by pressing M 
    from the normal map display (so press MM from the top level).
    
    Display Object List
    This option displays the results of the Object List command (]). 
    For example:
    
      There is 1 wanted object:
       ! a Potion of Resistance               S 17 E 29
    
      There are 4 other objects:
       | a Two-Handed Sword (3d6)             S 18 E 30
       \ a Lead-Filled Mace (3d4)             S 18 E 28
       ] a Pair of Metal Shod Boots [6]       S 18 E 29
       / an Awl-Pike (1d8)                    S 19 E 29
    
    Display Monster List
    This option displays the results of the Monster List command ([). 
    For example:
    
      You are aware of 4 monsters, 4 are awake:
       t Aimless looking merchant (2 awake)
       t Agent of black market                N  9 W 54
       t Singing, happy drunk                 S 22 E 72
    
    Display messages
    Display the most recently generated messages (cf The ^P command).
    
    Display overhead view
    Display an overhead view of the entire dungeon. This is very slow 
    and gives the same results as the M command.
    
    Display monster recall
    Display a description of the most monster which has been most 
    recently attacked, targeted, or examined in some way.
    
    Display object recall
    Display a description of the most recently selected object. 
    Currently this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks. This window 
    flag may be usefully combined with others, such as "monster 
    recall".
    
    Display dungeon view
    Display a copy of dungeon map.
    
    Display borg messages
    This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not 
    currently supported in this variant.
    
    Display borg status
    This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not 
    currently supported in this variant.
