Options and Effects

Most of the options are accessible through the = command, which 
provides an interface to the various sets of options available to the 
player.

In the descriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary 
which is shown on the options screen, plus the internal name of the 
option in parenthesis, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref 
files to force the option to a given setting (see [a] for more info).

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including 
disturb (cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are 
in progress), flush (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress 
queue, including any macros in progress), and fresh (dump any pending 
output to the screen).

Birth options

The birth options can only be accessed while creating a new character 
(press = while creating the character). There is no way to turn them 
off after the creation is finished!
  
  Easy Identify (easy_id)
  This option simplifies the identification of objects, making Identify 
  work just like *Identify*. However, this renders many spells (such as 
  Stone Tell in Nature and Identify True in Sorcery) and objects (such 
  as Staves of *Identify*) redundant or pointless. Also, some classes 
  (such as the Archaeologist) are designed with early access to 
  *Identify* as a principle bonus. Enabling this option removes the 
  advantages of these classes, making them less worthy of playing.
  
  In addition, this birth option will also affect the early game 
  pseudo-identification of objects. Normally, objects must be carried 
  in your pack for some time before you become aware of their quality. 
  The length of time is class dependent, as is the amount of 
  information revealed through pseudo-identification (see [b]). With 
  Easy Identify enabled, all players will get instantaneous and full 
  pseudo-identification of objects, making this aspect of gameplay much 
  easier as well.
  
  Easy Lore (easy_lore)
  With this option enabled, the player will be born with complete 
  knowledge of monster lore, including the various attacks and nasty 
  surprises that many monsters usually offer to the uninitiated. This 
  is a bit of a spoiler option, but is available for those who don't 
  enjoy learning each of the many monsters present in the game. Like 
  the Easy Identify option, Easy Lore also renders a few aspects of the 
  game non-functional or pointless, including the ability to Probe 
  monsters to learn about them as you encounter them, and the town 
  Beastmaster Lore service to learn about monsters before you see them 
  (for a price, of course).
  
  Monsters learn from their mistakes (smart_learn)
  Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to, and 
  to use this information to choose the best attacks.
  
  Monsters exploit players weaknesses (smart_cheat)
  Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, and 
  to use this information to choose the best attacks.
  
  Play without a wilderness (no_wilderness)
  This option disables the wilderness, forcing you to play with a 
  single special town level. As a result, the only dungeon that will be 
  available is the Pits of Angband. However, the town is relatively 
  well serviced and many, if not most, of the various fixed quests will 
  be available for your pleasure (see [c]).
  
  Stores are permanently closed (ironman_shops)
  This option closes all shops. Try to survive in the deeps of the 
  dungeon without supplies from town. Your Home still functions 
  normally, and various town services are still available.
  
  Always create unusually small dungeon levels (ironman_small_levels)
  If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than 
  usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option below.
  
  Disable recall and use of up stairs (ironman_downward)
  You are not allowed to climb upwards, or recall to town. All stairs 
  are downstairs and every time you teleport level, you'll teleport to 
  a deeper level.
  
  Always create empty 'arena' levels (ironman_empty_levels)
  If this option is enabled, then every level will be empty 'arena' 
  level. See the "Allow empty 'arena' levels" option below.
  
  Always generate very unusual rooms (ironman_rooms)
  If this option is enabled, every room becomes a vault. It is unclear 
  whether this makes the game harder or easier.
  
  Nightmare mode(it isn't even remotely fair!) (ironman_nightmare)
  If this option is enabled, all monsters become unusually powerful, 
  and fast. And there will be various unbelievable things happening in 
  various situations. Furthermore, at 12:00 every night, you will have 
  a real nightmare. You need to be crazy to turn this option on!
  
  Preserve artifacts (preserve_mode)
  In non-preserve mode, once a fixed artifact is generated (either on 
  the dungeon floor or in a monster drop), it will never be generated 
  again during that game. This means that if you miss the artifact by 
  leaving the level before you pick it up it is gone forever. On the 
  other hand, in preserve mode this behavior is only exhibited once you 
  have identified the artifact. It is therefor safer to leave a level 
  before it is completely explored as any fixed artifact can be 
  regenerated in subsequent levels.
  
  Allow use of autoroller for stats (autoroller)
  If you choose to use the auto-roller, you can specify minimum limit 
  of each stat. Once you have specified your desired statistics, the 
  computer will then randomly roll successive start-up characters and 
  compare them to your specified criteria. Each stat is rolled as a 
  number from 8 to 17, with a normal distribution, and is then 
  immediately modified based upon the race and class which you have 
  chosen. Once a character that matches or exceeds your expectations 
  has been rolled, the computer will display the character for you to 
  look at, and asks you whether you accept or not. You may press Enter 
  to accept. If you do not accept, you may press 'r' to resume rolling 
  and searching for the next match or, if this is not your first match, 
  'p' to return to the previous character which met your criteria.
  
  Increase capacity of your home (powerup_home)
  If this option is enabled, the capacity of your home will be expanded 
  to 20 pages. If not, capacity is only 2 pages.
  
Input Options
  
  Rogue-like commands (rogue_like_commands)
  Selects the roguelike command set which is an alternative way of 
  mapping keystrokes to underlying game commands. (see [d] for info).
  
  Pick things up by default (always_pickup)
  Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it 
  up. Otherwise, you must use the g command, or the - command while 
  walking. Combined with carry_query_flag, allows you to selectively 
  pick up all items which you step on.
  
  Prompt before picking things up (carry_query_flag)
  Forces the game to ask you if you want to pick something up when you 
  do something that would normally cause the item to be picked up.
  
  Activate quick messages (quick_messages)
  Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the -more- prompt 
  (useful for monster farming). Allows most keys to mean "no" to any 
  "(y/n)" prompt.
  
  Enable command selection menu (command_menu)
  The command selection menu is a helpful tool for beginning players. 
  By pressing ENTER, this option displays a menu of all available 
  commands, which the user may drill into with the arrow keys. This 
  makes it easier to discover the keypress required to do a specific 
  action:
  
    +----------------------------------------------------+
    |   Magic/Special         > Action                   |
    |   Item+----------------------------------------------------+
    |   Equi| > Rest(R)                 Disarm a trap(D)         |
    |   Info|   Search(s)               Look(l/x)                |
    |   Othe|   Target(*)               Dig(T/^t)                |
    +-------|   Enter global map(<)     Go down stairs(>)        |
            |   Command pets(p)         Search mode ON/OFF(S/#)  |
            +----------------------------------------------------+
  
  Prompt for floor item selection (other_query_flag)
  Forces the game to ask you before select an item on floor.
  
  Use old target by default (use_old_target)
  Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the 
  current target if there is one. Use of this option can be dangerous 
  if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear them when 
  done.
  
  Repeat obvious commands (always_repeat)
  Tells the game that when you attempt to open a door or chest, bash a 
  door, tunnel through walls, or disarm traps or chests, that you wish 
  to repeat the command 99 times (see [e]).
  
  Prompt for destruction of known worthless items (confirm_destroy)
  Normally, no confirmation will be asked if you attempt to destroy an 
  object which you know to be worthless. If this option is set, the 
  Destroy command always asks for confirmation.
  
  Confirm to wear/wield known cursed items (confirm_wear)
  Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find 
  themselves wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this option 
  is set, you should be safe from such typing mistakes: you will be 
  prompted if you attempt to wear or wield an item if your character 
  knows it is cursed.
  
  Prompt before exiting a quest level (confirm_quest)
  In the dungeon, you can freely climb up/down stairs and can return to 
  former floors normally. But in some quest level, including the random 
  quest, you can not return once you escaped from the level. If this 
  option is set, the program asks for confirmation before you go up the 
  stairs from such quest levels.
  
  Allow targetting pets (target_pet)
  Normally, the program doesn't automatically choose pets as target in 
  the targeting mode of attack spells. If this option is set, the 
  program always chooses every monster in sight as target.
  
  Automatically open doors (easy_open)
  Makes it easy for your character to open a door: simply by walking 
  into it! Also the open command will automatically select one 
  direction if only one door is near you.
  
  Automatically disarm traps (easy_disarm)
  Makes it easy for your character disarms a trap: simply by walking 
  into it! Also the disarm command will automatically select one 
  direction if only one known trap is near you.
  
  Display floor stacks in a list (easy_floor)
  Lets you select an item from a stack on the floor by browsing a list. 
  Also the look command will describe floor stack as "You see a stack 
  of n items.", when there is more than one item on a floor grid, and 
  display a list of items when you press 'x' at that time.
  
  Allow casting spells when short of mana (over_exert)
  Normally, you are prevented from casting spells when you don't have 
  enough mana since accidentally doing so can have very nasty 
  consequences, including death. If this option is set, then you are 
  permitted to cast spells at such dangerous times, with a warning 
  prompt, of course!
  
  Use numpad keys as cursor keys in editor mode (numpad_as_cursorkey)
  This option makes numpad keys work as cursor movement keys while text 
  editing mode. Which include auto-picker editor, inputing an 
  inscription, a macro action, and etc.
  
Map & Screen Options
  
  Center map while walking (center_player)
  With this option enabled, the map window automatically recenters on 
  the player as you walk. I find this rather disturbing, but it helps 
  if you are on a small monitor and worried about off screen monsters.
  
  Centering even while running (center_running)
  Normally, the map does not center on the player if the player moves 
  with the "run" command, only when the running finishes. If this 
  option is set, the map always centers on the player.
  
  Use special colors for torch-lit grids (view_yellow_lite)
  This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids in 
  certain situations (see the entries for"view_granite_lite" and 
  "view_special_lite"). Turning this option off will slightly improve 
  game speed.
  
  Use special colors for 'viewable' grids (view_bright_lite)
  This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable" grids 
  in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and 
  "view_special_lite"). When this option is set, floor grids which are 
  normally drawn in "white" but which are not currently "viewable" by 
  the player are instead drawn in "dark gray". This makes the 
  "viewable" grids to appear "brighter" than the others, allowing the 
  player to easily determine which floor grids are in "line of sight". 
  Turning this option off will probably increase the speed of the game.
  
  Use special colors for wall grids (view_granite_lite)
  This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids 
  which are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally 
  are). When the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid 
  is torch-lit, we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the 
  "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the "view_bright_lite" option is 
  set, and the grid is not in line of sight, or the grid is dark, or 
  the grid is only "partially" lit, then we use "gray", otherwise we 
  use the normal "white". Turning this option off will probably 
  increase the speed of the game. This option may not work well if the 
  attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed.
  
  Use special colors for floor grids (view_special_lite)
  This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids 
  which are normally drawn in "white" (as they normally are). When the 
  player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit, 
  we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" 
  option, else if the grid is "dark", we use "dark gray", else if the 
  "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line of 
  sight, we use "gray", otherwise we use the normal "white". Turning 
  this option off will probably increase the speed of the game. This 
  option may not work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have 
  been changed
  
  Map remembers all perma-lit grids (view_perma_grids)
  Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player. This 
  option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids were 
  perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids, 
  unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids. Turning off this option 
  allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line of 
  sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite" 
  option. Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player are 
  always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is 
  memorized independently from the memorization of the grid itself.
  
  Map remembers all torch-lit grids (view_torch_grids)
  Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player. 
  This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids 
  have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use 
  of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display of 
  floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray","lit" 
  grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite" option is 
  set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in 
  "orange". Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit" are 
  considered to be "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless the 
  "view_yellow_lite" option is set, in which case they are drawn in 
  "yellow".
  
  Map marked by detect traps (view_unsafe_grids)
  Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a 
  detect trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This 
  allows you to determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect 
  traps, but does not ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x' are 
  trap free. This option has no effect on surface grids, but outdoor 
  locations cannot be trapped.
  
  Flush output while continuous command (fresh_before)
  This option forces the game to flush all output before every command. 
  This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game 
  somewhat. Note that this option is only useful when using macros, 
  resting, running, or repeating commands, since the output is always 
  flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the user.
      
  Flush output after monster's move (fresh_after)
  This option forces the game to flush all output after not only every 
  player command, but also after every round of processing monsters and 
  objects, which will give you maximal information, but may slow down 
  the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on faster machines 
  you normally do not have a chance to see the results anyway.
      
  Flush output after every message (fresh_message)
  This option forces the game to flush all output after every message 
  displayed by the game. This will give you maximal information, but 
  may slow down the game somewhat.
  
  Hilite the player with the cursor (hilite_player)
  Place the visible cursor on the player. This looks fine on some Unix 
  machines, but horrible on most graphics machines. Note that only some 
  machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, 
  hiding the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.
      
  Display actual path before shooting (display_path)
  When this option is set, the targeting mode will show path from you 
  to current target point continuously.
  
Text Display Options
  
  Plain object descriptions (plain_descriptions)
  This option disables "full" names for identified 'flavored' objects, 
  in other words, if this option is not in use, an identified Potion of 
  Speed could be listed (for example) as a Blue Potion of Speed. If you 
  prefer simpler, less verbose descriptions, set this option.
  
  Always show list when choosing items (always_show_list)
  When this option is set, all commands which lets you to choose an 
  item from inventory or equipment list will automatically show list 
  when activated.
  
  Show dungeon level in feet (depth_in_feet)
  Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as an actual level. 
  This also affects the monster memory display.
  
  Show labels in object listings (show_labels)
  Display the labels for objects in the equipment list, and in any 
  special window which is displaying the equipment. These labels 
  indicate what the player is using the object for, such as "wielding" 
  or "wearing" (in a given location). After you have played for a 
  while, this information is no longer useful, and can be annoying.
  
  Show weights in object listings (show_weights)
  Display the weights of objects in the inventory and equipment lists, 
  and in stores, and in any special window which is displaying any of 
  these lists.
  
  Show discounts in object listings (show_discounts)
  Display the discount of the object, if any, as part of its 
  inscription. Disabling this option won't remove the object's 
  discount. Rather, this information will no longer be displayed to the 
  player.
  
  Show items graphics (show_item_graph)
  Displays small icons of the items in your inventory list, equipment 
  list and stores.
  
  Display 'equippy' chars (equippy_chars)
  This option will show you a graphical representation of your worn 
  equipment on the main screen. The 'equippy' chars will use the 
  standard symbols of the respective items.
  
  Display player hp bar (display_hp_bar)
  This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current health. For example:
    @[*******--]
  
  Display player sp bar (display_sp_bar)
  This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current mana. For example:
    ?[***------]
  
  Display detailed food status (display_food_bar)
  This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details 
  your current state of hunger. For example:
    ,[**-------]
  
  Compress messages in savefiles (compress_savefile)
  Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages" that 
  the player has received. This can cut the size of the savefile by a 
  drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.
  
  Describe obj's extra resistances by abbreviation (abbrev_extra)
  When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string 
  for the object's extra resitances and extra abilities are added as 
  fake inscriptions of the object.
  
  A word "EXTRA" means that the ability must not be obvious from the 
  objects name. For example, a pair of boots of Levitation sometimes 
  has EXTRA shard resistance. But fire resistance of an armor of Resist 
  Fire is not an EXTRA resistance.
  
  The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are 
  described in [f].
  
  Describe obj's all resistances by abbreviation (abbrev_all)
  When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string 
  for all the object's resitances and abilities are added as fake 
  inscriptions of the object.
  
  The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are 
  described in [g].
  
  Show the experience needed for the next level (exp_need)
  Setting this option to yes alters the display of experience on the 
  left of the main screen to the experience needed to reach the next 
  character level, instead of the character's current total experience.
  
  Ignore actions of out of sight monsters (ignore_unview)
  With this option, you won't receive messages when out of sight 
  monsters fight one another. This is useful if you are playing with 
  lots of pets and don't wish to read a blow by blow account of the 
  battle raging around you.
  
Game Play Options
  
  Merge inscriptions when stacking (stack_force_notes)
  Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty 
  inscription and the other does not. The resulting stack keeps the 
  non-empty inscription.
  
  Merge discounts when stacking (stack_force_costs)
  Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have 
  different discounts. The resulting stack keeps the largest discount. 
  This option may cause you to lose "value", but will give you optimal 
  pack usage.
  
  Expand the power of the list commands (expand_list)
  Expand the "listing" commands so that they "wrap" at the "edges" of 
  the appropriate list. This allows the "look" and "target" commands to 
  "cycle" through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify 
  symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.
  
  Allow unusually small dungeon levels (small_levels)
  This option enables the creation of levels of varying sizes. Levels 
  that are as small as the town level (i.e. 1 'screen') are possible, 
  yet they can be dangerous, especially for a low level character. Note 
  that this option has the side effect of enabling / disabling 
  'destroyed' levels (they are enabled if small levels are).
  
  Always create unusually small dungeon levels (always_small_levels)
  If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than 
  usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option above.
  
  Allow empty 'arena' levels (empty_levels)
  Normal dungeon levels consist mostly of rock. If this option is in 
  use, levels which have empty floor instead of solid rock may also be 
  created (somewhat reminiscent of Nethack's "big-room" levels). These 
  levels can be extremely deadly, especially with breathing monsters 
  (since there are few obstructions to shield). Arena levels may have 
  vaults, nests and pits in them like normal levels. Some arena levels 
  are dark when they are created, but most are lit.
  
  Boundary walls become 'permanent wall' (bound_walls_perm)
  If this option is set, boundaries of dungeon floors will explicitly 
  look like permanent walls. If unset, those will look like normal 
  walls, but still behave as permanent walls.
  
  Leave last words when your character dies (last_words)
  Display a random line from the "death.txt" file when your character 
  dies and then allow you to rewrite these last words. If this option 
  is not selected, the "You die." message is displayed instead.
  
  Allow use of debug/cheat options (allow_debug_opts)
  Since use of debug command(^A), wizard mode(^W), and Cheating options 
  ('C' in options panel) mark the player as "Cheater" who can't 
  register their score, these debug/cheat options are forbidden by 
  default. The allow_debug_opts option removes these restrictions, and 
  allow the player to become "Cheater". But perhaps you just want to 
  test?
  
Disturbance Options
  
  Run past stairs (find_ignore_stairs)
  Ignore stairs when running.
      
  Run through open doors (find_ignore_doors)
  Ignore open doors when running.
      
  Run past known corners (find_cut)
  Cut sharply around known corners when running. This will result in 
  faster running, but may cause you to run into a lurking monster.
  
  Check for user abort while continuous command (check_abort)
  Avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting or 
  running or repeated commands. This not only makes the game much more 
  efficient (on many systems), but also allows the use of certain 
  obscure macro sequences, such as turning this option on, resting 
  until done, turning this option off, and casting a spell. Note that 
  the use of this option may be dangerous on certain "graphic" 
  machines. Resting for long periods of time with this option set is 
  dangerous since the resting may not stop until the user takes damage 
  from starvation.
  
  Flush input on various failures (flush_failure)
  This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever 
  various "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to 
  use a wand, etc. This is very useful if you use macros which include 
  "directional" components with commands that can fail, since it will 
  prevent you from walking towards monsters when your spells fail.
  
  Flush input whenever disturbed (flush_disturb)
  This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the 
  character is "disturbed". This is useful if you use macros which take 
  time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while 
  being attacked by a monster.
      
  Disturb whenever any monster moves (disturb_move)
  Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears. 
  This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so 
  you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near 
  such monsters.
  
  Disturb whenever high-level monster moves (disturb_high)
  Disturb the player when any monster whose level is higher than the 
  player moves, appears, or disappears. This includes monsters which 
  are only visible due to telepathy.
  
  Disturb whenever viewable monster moves (disturb_near)
  Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any 
  monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any 
  viewable monster becomes no longer viewable. This option ignores the 
  existence of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether a 
  monster is "viewable". See also the "view_reduce_view" option.
  
  Disturb when visible pets move (disturb_pets)
  The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not apply 
  to pets: for example, it can be annoying if your rest is always 
  disturbed by a pet dog who pops in every now and then. By default, 
  pets do not disturb you even if full monster disturbance options are 
  set. If you want your pets to disturb you like normal monsters, set 
  this option.
  
  Disturb whenever map panel changes (disturb_panel)
  This option causes you to be disturbed by the map scrolling, as it 
  does automatically when you get close to the edge of the screen.
      
  Disturb whenever player state changes (disturb_state)
  This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state 
  changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.
  
  Disturb whenever boring things happen (disturb_minor)
  This option causes you to be disturbed by various bring things, 
  including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and 
  beginning to run out of fuel.
  
  Audible bell (on errors, etc) (ring_bell)
  Attempt to make a bell noise when various errors occur.
      
  Disturb when leaving trap detected area (disturb_trap_detect)
  This option causes you to be disturbed when the player is running out 
  of trap-detected area.
  
  Alert when leaving trap detected area (alert_trap_detect)
  This option alerts you with message when the player is moving out of 
  the trap-detected area.
  
Easy Auto-Destroyer Options
  
  Use easy auto-destroyer (destroy_items)
  This option turns The Easy Destroyer on and off. If enabled, The Easy 
  Destroyer will destroy all objects unless the object is protected by 
  one or more of the leave_* options discussed below.
  
    Note: The Easy Auto-Destroyer is a simpler to use 
    version of the full featured Mogaminator discussed in 
    [h]. It is designed for those who feel the full version 
    is too complicated to use. However, you really should 
    only use one or the other. So if you are using the full 
    version, then you should not also enable the easy 
    version.
  
  Apply auto-destroy as sense feeling (destroy_feeling)
  If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy 
  Destroyer will take actions whenever the player senses the quality of 
  an object (i.e., whenever pseudo-id kicks in).
  
  Apply auto-destroy as identify an item (destroy_identify)
  If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy 
  Destroyer will take actions whenever the player identifies an object, 
  whether with a spell or with a magical device (but, alas, not via a 
  town service).
  
  List the rule used when applying the Mogaminator (destroy_debug)
  This is a debugging option when using the full-featured Mogaminator. 
  Enabling this option results in the reporting of the rule used 
  whenever an action is taken, such as pickup, auto-identify or 
  destroy. The rule in question will appear in the message line. For 
  example:
    You have 26 charges remaining. (AutoID:~?unidentified rods) You see a 
    Rod: Frost Ball (1/3 charges). (Destroy:(!rods:frost ball$)
    Auto-destroying.
  
  In addition, the matching rule will be displayed when inspecting 
  objects. For example:
    an Amulet (Defender) [+12]
      Resist Acid, Electricity, Fire, Cold, Poison
      Free Action; See Invisible; Levitation
      It cannot be harmed by the elements.
      Autopick: ~*identified* amulets more value than 10000
    
  Auto-destroyer leaves known worthy items (leave_worth)
  This option protects known objects that can be sold in stores from auto-destrD
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves weapons and armour (leave_equip)
  This option protects all weapons and armour from auto-destruction by The EasyD
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves closed chests (leave_chest)
  This option protects all chests which are not yet opened from auto-destructioD
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves wanted corpses (leave_wanted)
  This option protects corpses of monsters wanted at the Hunter's office from aD
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves corpses and skeletons (leave_corpse)
  This option protects all corpses and skeletons from auto-destruction by The ED
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves junk (leave_junk)
  This option protects all 'junk', such as Shards of Pottery or Broken Stick, fA
  
  Auto-destroyer leaves items your race/class needs (leave_special)
  This option protects specific items which are normally worthless, but very ime
  
  Base Delay Factor
  
  The delay_factor value, if non-zero, is used to slow down the game, 
  which is useful to allow you to observe the animations of bolt, beam, 
  and ball attacks. The actual delay is equal to delay_factor cubed, in 
  milliseconds.
  
  Hitpoint Warning
  
  The hitpoint_warn value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal 
  hitpoints at which the player is warned that he may die. It is also 
  used as the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.
  
  Autosave Options
  
  Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not 
  needed at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which 
  it, to be frank, probably is not), the user might forget to save and 
  his hardware could fail him. For all of these reasons, you may want 
  to use these options:
    
    Autosave when entering new levels (autosave_l)
    If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your 
    character every time before creating a new dungeon level.
    
    Timed autosave (autosave_t)
    If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your 
    character every n game turns, where n is the "frequency". To set 
    the frequency press F. It will increase the frequency to the next 
    category (and from 25000 to 0), the categories being every 50, 100, 
    250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 and 25000 turns. Note that the 
    frequency must be higher than 0 and the "Timed autosave" set to 
    "yes" for timed autosaves to take place.
    
  Window Flags
  
  These options select what kind of information is displayed in which 
  window. Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which 
  can be used to display useful information generally available through 
  other means. The best thing about these windows is that they are 
  updated automatically (usually) to reflect the current state of the 
  world. The "window options" can be used to specify what should be 
  displayed in each window. The possible choices should be pretty 
  obvious.
    
    Display inven/equip
    Display the player inventory (and sometimes the equipment). Note 
    that you can toggle between Inventory and Equipment by pressing ^I.
    
    Display equip/inven
    Display the player equipment (and sometimes the inventory). Note 
    that you can toggle between Inventory and Equipment by pressing ^I.
    
    Display Object List
    This option displays the results of the Object List command (]). 
    For example:
    
      There is 1 wanted object:
       ! a Potion of Resistance               S 17 E 29
    
      There are 4 other objects:
       | a Two-Handed Sword (3d6)             S 18 E 30
       \ a Lead-Filled Mace (3d4)             S 18 E 28
       ] a Pair of Metal Shod Boots [6]       S 18 E 29
       / an Awl-Pike (1d8)                    S 19 E 29
    
    Display Monster List
    This option displays the results of the Monster List command ([). 
    For example:
    
      You are aware of 4 monsters, 4 are awake:
       t Aimless looking merchant (2 awake)
       t Agent of black market                N  9 W 54
       t Singing, happy drunk                 S 22 E 72
    
    Display messages
    Display the most recently generated messages (cf The ^P command).
    
    Display overhead view
    Display an overhead view of the entire dungeon. This is very slow 
    and gives the same results as the M command.
    
    Display monster recall
    Display a description of the most monster which has been most 
    recently attacked, targeted, or examined in some way.
    
    Display object recall
    Display a description of the most recently selected object. 
    Currently this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks. This window 
    flag may be usefully combined with others, such as "monster 
    recall".
    
    Display dungeon view
    Display a copy of dungeon map.
    
    Display borg messages
    This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not 
    currently supported in this variant.
    
    Display borg status
    This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not 
    currently supported in this variant.
    
  Cheating Options
  
  Using the cheating options marks your character as "Cheater" and you 
  won't get into the high-score list. Turning off the cheating options 
  later does NOT allow your character to get a highscore entry, so 
  think twice before using any cheat.
    
    Peek into object creation (cheat_peek)
    Cheaters never win. But they can peek at object creation.
    
    Peek into monster creation (cheat_hear)
    Cheaters never win. But they can peek at monster creation.
    
    Peek into dungeon creation (cheat_room)
    Cheaters never win. But they can peek at room creation.
    
    Peek into something else (cheat_xtra)
    Cheaters never win. But they can see debugging messages.
    
    Know complete monster info (cheat_know)
    Cheaters never win. But they can know all about monsters.
    
    Allow player to avoid death (cheat_live)
    Cheaters never win. But they can cheat death.
    
    Ask for saving death (cheat_save)
    Cheaters never win. But they can choose whether they save dead 
    character data or not when they die.
