The Personalities

Your personality is the way you see and act in the world, and has a 
small but significant effect on your stats and skills. In general you 
should pick a personality that complements the strengths and weaknesses 
inherent in your race and class. Your choice of personality is the 
least important decision you make when creating your character (after 
gender).

For details on the Primary Statistics, see [a]. For information about 
the various Skills, see [b]. The skill descriptions in this document 
are for comparison purposes only. For example, your fledgling munchkin 
will not be born with Legendary[20] melee skill. In general, skills are 
also influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. To compare 
the various personalities, you might want to take a look at [c] the 
personality tables below.
