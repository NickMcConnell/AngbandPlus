The Personalities

Your personality is the way you see and act in the world, and has a 
small but significant effect on your stats and skills. In general you 
should pick a personality that complements the strengths and weaknesses 
inherent in your race and class. Your choice of personality is the 
least important decision you make when creating your character (after 
gender).

For details on the Primary Statistics, see [a]. For information about 
the various Skills, see [b]. The skill descriptions in this document 
are for comparison purposes only. For example, your fledgling munchkin 
will not be born with Legendary[20] melee skill. In general, skills are 
also influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. To compare 
the various personalities, you might want to take a look at [c] the 
personality tables below.

talents nor stat adjustments.

The Combat personality favors melee and shooting at the expense of 
other skills such as disarming, devices, and saving throws. Strength 
and agility are enhanced, but intelligence and wisdom are decreased.

Sexy increases all of your stats and skills, but your haughty attitude 
will aggravate all monsters.

  Strength      +1        Disarming   Superb

Lucky
A Lucky person has poor stats but, surprisingly, can do all things 
well. For some reason, good things seem to happen more often to lucky 
players.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      -2        Disarming   Superb

Patient
A Patient person does things carefully. Patient people have high 
constitution, and high resilience, but poor abilities in most other 
skills. Also it directly influences your life rating.

  Strength      -1        Disarming   Very Bad

Craven
A Craven person is a coward, preferring to avoid a fight at any cost. 
Craven adventurers shoot and use devices well, their stealth is 
impressive, and they can move fast when not fighting; but their stats 
and other skills are somewhat wanting.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      -1        Disarming   Excellent

  Experience   100%       Bows        Superb       
  
Hasty
A Hasty person endeavors to do all things quickly. Speed, rather than 
skill and patience, are paramount, and the Hasty adventurer moves 
quickly through the dungeon, bungling much.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +0        Disarming   Very Bad

  Experience   100%       Bows        Bad          
  
Lazy
A Lazy person has no good stats and can do no action well. Also it has 
a direct bad influence on your spell fail rate.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      -2        Disarming   Very Bad

  Experience   100%       Bows        Very Bad     
  
Unlucky
An Unlucky adventurer looks impressive on paper and should, by rights, 
have an easy time - but somehow their fights don't go quite so 
smoothly, and the items they most need never seem to drop...

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +2        Disarming   Very Bad     
  Intelligence  +2        Device      Good

Chaotic
Chaotic adventurers are servants of the Demon Lords of Chaos, and often 
receive a reward - or punishment - from their patrons when they gain a 
level. Their strengths and weaknesses are unpredictable; even their 
stat bonuses are subject to change.

  Stats                   Skills

Mundane
Mundane adventurers have few talents to speak of, and are incapable of 
using spells and not very good with magical devices; but their 
anti-magic allows them to resist the effects of many dangerous magical 
attacks.

Munchkin
The Munchkin personality is for players who love being overpowered. It 
raises all your stats and skills; with this personality, you can win 
the game easily, but gain no honor in doing so.

  Stats                   Skills
