The Personalities

Your personality is the way you see and act in the world, and has a 
small but significant effect on your stats and skills. In general, you 
should pick a personality that complements the strengths and weaknesses 
inherent in your race and class. Most personalities only make a minor 
difference, but a few can change the game dramatically.

For details on the Stats, see [a]. For information about the Skills, 
see [b]. The skill descriptions in this document are for comparison 
purposes only; for example, your fledgling munchkin will not be born 
with Amber[25] melee skill. In general, skills are also influenced by 
level, race, class, stats and equipment. To compare the stat and skill 
boosts of each personality, take a look at the [c] personality tables 
below.

Ordinary
An ordinary person is average in every respect, gaining neither skills, 
talents nor stat adjustments.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +0        Disarming   Fair

Mighty
Mighty raises your physical stats, skills and stamina, but reduces your 
magical abilities and gives a slight penalty to your spell fail rates. 
It is the most warrior-like personality.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +2        Disarming   Bad          
  Intelligence  -2        Device      Bad

  Life Rating  102%       Melee       Superb       
  Experience   100%       Archery     Fair         
  
Shrewd
Being Shrewd does not give you an impressive physique, but good device 
handling embiggens the smallest man; this is the stereotypical Mage 
personality, yet can also help a warrior complement his weaknesses. 
Shrewdness has a direct positive influence on spell fail rates.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      -2        Disarming   Good         
  Intelligence  +2        Device      Excellent    
  Wisdom        +0        Save        Fair

  Experience   100%       Archery     Poor         
  
Pious
Pious deepens your faith in your God. It makes your physical ability 
average, and your stats suitable for a priest.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +0        Disarming   Bad          
  Intelligence  -1        Device      Fair         
  Wisdom        +2        Save        Good

  Experience   100%       Archery     Poor         
  
Nimble
Nimbleness is good for your skills and allows you to move less noisily; 
but your raw strength is somewhat lacking, and you cannot survive quite 
as many hits.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      -1        Disarming   Excellent    
  Intelligence  +1        Device      Fair         
  Wisdom        -1        Save        Poor

  Life Rating   99%       Melee       Fair         
  Experience   100%       Archery     Very Good    
  
Fearless
Being Fearless raises your melee skills and force of personality, 
besides helping you resist fear; but your constitution and hit points 
are negatively affected.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +1        Disarming   Bad          
  Intelligence  +0        Device      Fair

  Constitution  -1        Searching   Good         
  Charisma      +1        Perception  Bad

  Experience   100%       Archery     Fair         
  
Combat
Combative adventurers favor melee and shooting at the expense of other 
skills such as disarming, device-skill, or saving throw; yet this 
personality has more subtlety to it than the raw, untempered muscle of 
Mighty.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +1        Disarming   Poor

  Experience   100%       Archery     Good         
  
Sexy
Sexy adventurers have excellent stats and skills, but their haughty 
attitude aggravates all monsters.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +1        Disarming   Superb

  Experience   100%       Archery     Very Good    
  
Lucky
A Lucky adventurer has poor stats but, surprisingly, can do all things 
well. For some reason, good things seem to happen more often to lucky 
players.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      -2        Disarming   Superb

  Experience   100%       Archery     Excellent    
  
Patient
A Patient adventurer does everything with great care, but not always 
with great expertise. Patient characters have high constitution and 
resilience but fairly mediocre skills, and get a slight penalty to 
spell fail rates.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      -1        Disarming   Bad

  Experience   100%       Archery     Poor         
  
Craven
A Craven person is a coward, preferring to avoid a fight at any cost. 
Craven adventurers shoot and use devices well, their stealth is 
impressive, and they can move fast when not fighting; but their stats 
and other skills are somewhat wanting.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      -1        Disarming   Very Good    
  Intelligence  +1        Device      Very Good

  Life Rating   99%       Melee       Very Bad     
  Experience   100%       Archery     Very Good    
  
Hasty
A Hasty person endeavors to do all things quickly. Speed, rather than 
skill or care, is paramount, and the Hasty adventurer moves quickly 
through the dungeon, bungling much.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +0        Disarming   Bad          
  Intelligence  -1        Device      Bad

  Experience   100%       Archery     Poor         
  
Lazy
A Lazy person has no good stats and can do no action well. All fail 
rates are negatively impacted. Yet some whisper that the less hard you 
work, the greater the reward...

  Stats                   Skills

  Experience   100%       Archery     Poor         
  
Unlucky
An Unlucky adventurer looks impressive on paper and should, by rights, 
have an easy time - but somehow their fights don't go quite so 
smoothly, and the items they most need never seem to drop.

  Stats                   Skills

Chaotic
Chaotic adventurers are servants of the Demon Lords of Chaos, and often 
receive a reward - or punishment - from their patrons when they gain a 
level. Their strengths and weaknesses are unpredictable; even their 
stat bonuses are subject to change.

Mundane
Mundane adventurers have few talents to speak of, and are incapable of 
using spells and not very good with magical devices; but their 
anti-magic allows them to resist the effects of many dangerous curses.

  Stats                   Skills

Munchkin
The Munchkin personality is for players who love being overpowered. It 
raises all your stats and skills; with this personality, you can win 
the game easily, but gain no honor in doing so.

  Stats                   Skills
  Strength      +3        Disarming   Superb

Fragile
As a Fragile adventurer, you lack both self-confidence and physical 
toughness. Due to your incredibly low stamina, you are quickly 
exhausted by melee, or ranged combat, or magical combat, or any other 
strenuous activity. (Maybe you should just stay at home, quietly 
reading some book that isn't too heavy.)

  Stats                   Skills

Sneaky
Sneaky adventurers are stealthy and at home with light stabbing 
weapons; but face-to-face combat with heavier weapons plays against 
their strengths.

Noble
As a Noble person, you have the benefits of an upper-class upbringing 
(at least, you consider them benefits). You start with extra money, and 
seem to have a relatively easy time acquiring even more money; but 
whether other aspects of the adventuring life will come to you as 
naturally remains to be seen.

Split
You have multiple personalities, and inherit the upsides and downsides 
of each. At all times, one of your personalities is dominant, and you 
receive the full effects of that personality; the remaining 
personalities are either partially suppressed or fully suppressed. A 
partially suppressed personality gives reduced stat and skill bonuses, 
and some other effects (like the walking speed bonus of Craven or the 
aggravation from Sexy) will be absent entirely, but other parts of the 
personality apply normally. A fully dormant personality has no effect 
on you at the moment, but may resurface later! Level gains, and the 
trauma of taking heavy damage, can cause previously suppressed 
personalities to become dominant and vice versa.
