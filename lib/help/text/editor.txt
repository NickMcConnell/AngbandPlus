The Mogaminator

The Mogaminator is a rule based system for managing objects 
automatically. With this system, you can decide which objects to 
pickup, which to destroy, which to automatically identify, and which to 
display in the special full screen map. You can automatically inscribe 
certain objects to suit your tastes (for example, spellbooks or magical 
devices) and even enter conditional statements to handle the 
preferences of different classes.

This document describes this system in tutorial fashion, assuming you 
know nothing about it. Detailed reference material will appear towards 
the bottom of this document (see [a] if you really cannot wait!).

    This system is named after its original author. I got 
    rather tired of calling it the Automatic Pickup and 
    Destruction Preferences, which is not only a lot to 
    type, but sounds rather stuffy and boring as well. 
    Also, it was sometimes called The Auto-Destroyer, but, 
    as you are about to learn, automatic destruction is 
    only part of the story.

Review of Object Knowledge
There is no doubt about it: The game generates lots and lots of 
objects. Some are valuable and some are not. And what you consider 
worthy will even change based on your character's class and progress. 
Dealing with objects, especially later in the game, can become a bit of 
a nuisance. Fortunately, there are ways to handle the mountains of 
stuff that your character is likely to encounter.

First, let's do a quick review. When you find an object, it will 
generally be unidentified. You might know the basic kind of object it 
is (e.g. a sword), and perhaps its damage dice (if it is a weapon) or 
its base AC (if it is armor), but not much else. Carry the object 
around a bit in your pack, and you might eventually get a sense of the 
quality of the object: whether it is good, or excellent or even 
special, or just average or perhaps even terrible. Details depend on 
your class and this is called pseudo-id. See [b] for more information. 
If you are impatient, you can identify the object right away, provided 
you have a means to do so (spell, scroll or magical device). 
Identification tells you a little more about the object, including its 
obvious magical bonuses and its ego type or artifact name, should you 
be so lucky to find an excellent or special item. But Identify 
generally won't tell you everything about the object. You might need to 
*Identify* it as well to learn about all its attributes.

To recap: your knowledge of an object is in one of the following 
states:
  [1] Unknown
  [2] Pseudo-Identified
  [3] Identified
  [4] *Identified

Since Identify and *Identify* are scarce resources, you will need to 
excercise some restraint when using them. Actually, Identify is rather 
common and it is only *Identify* you really need to worry about, at 
least once you reach the middle part of the game.

For mushrooms, potions and scrolls, things are a little different. 
These objects come in flavors, and once you have learned the flavor, 
you will immediately recognize all future instances of that object. 
Indeed, all instances of the object are exactly alike, so the 
identification game is simply to discover and know the first instance 
of the object, and then decide, via your pickup and destroy 
preferences, what to do with future instances of this type of object. 
For these objects, Identify usually suffices.

For excellent objects, you also need to learn about the ego type 
itself. For example, the first time you encounter a (Pattern) weapon, 
your character will have no knowledge of its basic attributes. Once you 
*Identify* an instance of this ego, you become aware of future 
instances of this ego, just like with flavors of potions and scrolls. 
This will allow you to cut back on your use of *Identify*, but realize 
that many ego types also have some random bonuses in addition to their 
fixed attributes. When you learn an ego type, it is only the fixed 
attributes that you become aware of.

Managing Objects

So, how do you manage this? Well, you can certainly manage things 
manually, dealing with each object in isolation as you encounter it. 
For the early game, this is doable. But the first time you Ctrl+Arrow 
through a horde orcs or trolls, you will find this approach tedious. At 
this point, I recommend you bite the bullet and enable The Mogaminator. 
It is worth learning about if you plan on playing this variant for any 
length of time. There is also an Easy Destroyer approach to managing 
objects, but I'd prefer you not use it. The choice is yours, though, 
but one caution: Decide which system you are going to use and only use 
that system. In other words, if you turn The Mogaminator on, then turn 
off the Easy Destroyer, and vice versa. If you leave both systems on, 
then there are precedence issues (one system might destroy what is 
marked as desirable via the other system) and it can be hard to track 
down why some undesirable event is happening.

What is The Mogaminator? Basically, it is a rule based system for 
taking a given action each time you encounter a certain type of object. 
The default action is pickup, and this action is used whenever you fail 
to specify an alternative action. But you will also want to learn about 
destroying objects too, since much of what you find will be junk. Let's 
discuss the basics.

Basic Usage

In this section, I'll describe using The Mogaminator without knowing 
anything at all about it. So, I am assuming you are a new player. 
Please don't take offense :)

You turn on this system by pressing _, which also brings up an in-game 
editor where you can manage your preferences. It might look something 
like:

(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)         (0,10)
#***
#***  You have activated the Auto-Picker Editor for the first time.
#***  Since user pref file for autopick is not yet created,
#***  the default setting is loaded from lib/pref/pickpref.prf .
#***

potions:resist#!k!q
potions:resistance#!k!q
potions:stone skin#!k
potions:heroism
potions:speed#!k!q
potions:giant strength#!k

potions:enlightenment

potions:of strength#!k
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pickup and inscribe "!E" on all items which have "mushroom of restoring" as part
of its name.  Display these items when you press the M key in the full 'M'ap.


Since you are new, you probably want to run from this complexity as 
fast as you can. Notice the top line of the screen where it tells you 
how to get out: ^Q. That's fine and we'll discuss this file in detail, 
including its format and what each line means later on below. The 
important thing is that the first time you press _ turns this system 
on, and initializes it with some pretty nice default preferences.

Now, you will find much of the junk you encounter being destroyed. For 
example, all those corpses and skeletons that you are leaving behind as 
you hack and slash your way through the dungeon. That in itself is 
rather nice. But, you will still run into objects you consider useless. 
For example, suppose you took that all important first step on the road 
to slaying Morgoth, and bought a lantern at the General Store. Now, you 
don't really care about torches anymore. Use the k command (or ^D for 
the Roguelike keyset) and you get a prompt like:
  Really destroy Wooden Torches {unidentified}? [y/n/Auto]

Notice the Auto option. Choose that and you get a message that the 
object is destroyed, but the fact that you don't like torches is 
remembered by the system. The next time your character moves on top of 
one, it will automatically be destroyed.

And that is basically it. Keep registering stuff for automatic 
destruction as you encounter it, and you'll find objects becoming much 
easier to manage.

Correcting Mistakes

"Awesome! But what if I make a mistake and auto-register rings of 
speed?" Well, don't panic. You can easily fix things up, but doing so 
will require you to go back to the preference file editor. Press _ and 
then press END to move to the end of the document. This is where the 
game keeps track of any objects that you automatically register for 
destruction during the Destroy Object command. Your screen might look 
something like:

(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)         (0,199)
?:[GEQ $LEVEL 35]
!nameless common armors

?:[GEQ $LEVEL 30]
!nameless common weapons

?:[GEQ $LEVEL 20]
!average common weapons
!average common armors
?:1

?:[LEQ $LEVEL 34]
#(unidentified armors
#(unidentified weapons
?:1

~special items
!worthless items
#!unusable items
?:$AUTOREGISTER
# *Waring!* The lines below will be deleated later.
# Keep it by cut & paste if you need these lines for future characters.
(!unidentified lights:^wooden torch$

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Destroy unidentified light sources whose name is beginning with "wooden torch$".
Not displayed in the full map.  This line will be delete later.


You cannot tell from the picture above, but I placed the cursor on the 
very last line of the file. In my case, this is the line from when I 
auto-registered torches for destruction. Notice that at the very bottom 
of the screen, the game tells you exactly what each line means, and 
what will happen for the given rule. If you are curious, you can move 
the cursor around the default preference file and actually learn quite 
a bit about how the system works. For now, though, if you wish to undo 
any rules that you automatically added, simply delete the corresponding 
line from this file and then exit with the ^W option to save and apply 
your changes.

What About Stuff I Want?

That's correct: What you don't want is only half the story. Some 
objects you really, really want, such as stat potions and 5d5 long 
swords. Wouldn't it be nice if the game automatically picked these 
objects up for you whenever you encountered them? Or, even better, what 
if the game showed them to you in the Object List command and the Full 
Map Display? Then, assuming your detection was good, you could quickly 
see what worthy objects might be laying about on the current level.

Well, you can do all these things. At the moment, we still don't know 
anything about what those lines in the editor mean, but we have a vague 
notion that each line represents a single rule somehow. We also know 
that the auto-destroy lines from the Destroy Object command are being 
added to the bottom and are being displayed in a funny color. 
Generally, those lines are hands off: The game manages them for you, 
though, as we just saw above, it's fine to go ahead and delete them if 
you made a mistake with the auto-register option. And, we saw that the 
game comes with lots of rules already set up for you. You can ignore 
those for the time being, though you can also learn a bit by moving the 
cursor around in the default file and reading the detailed explanation 
at the bottom.

This is great, but let's say you really want a particular object. 
Suppose you want potions of Cure Critical Wounds (I'm trying to think 
of an example that isn't set in the default preferences). It's early in 
the game, and you find yourself getting hurt quite often. Wouldn't it 
be nice to be able to automatically display these potions? Well, you 
can easily do so by adding the following line to the top of the file:

(^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)       * (0,5)-(20,5)
#***
#***  You have activated the Auto-Picker Editor for the first time.
#***  Since user pref file for autopick is not yet created,
#***  the default setting is loaded from lib/pref/pickpref.prf .
#***

Here, you can see there is some sort of wanted potion in the Full 
Screen Map (M), though, unfortunately, you can tell what. Let's try the 
Object List (]) instead:

There are 7 wanted objects:                       ################# LEVEL      1
 ! 7 Potions of Cure Critical Wounds    S  1 E  1 ##..########.#### EXP       10
                                                  .........#.....#. AU       462
   [Press ESC to exit. Press ? for help]          ................. | }    [    

Bingo! You can even automatically travel to those delicious potions by 
pressing ` inside the Object List. What could be easier? With features 
like these, why isn't The Serpent of Chaos dead already?

To recap, adding the line "Cure Critical Wounds" means to automatically 
pick up any object having "Cure Critical Wounds" as part of its name. 
You don't have to type so much: "Crit" might work just as well. But the 
less you type, the more likely it is that your new rule will match 
other objects. For example, "Cure" would match potions of Cure Light 
Wounds, Cure Serious Wounds and Cure Critical Wounds. It might also 
pick up some magical devices that have some sort of Cure effect. 
Sometimes this is OK and even desirable. Other times, it behooves you 
to type more.

Introduction to Rules and Events

Let's begin to learn what is going on. Basically, the preference file 
is an ordered list of rules. Whenever a certain event happens, such as 
moving on top of an object, the rules are scanned, in order, and the 
first one that matches, if any, is applied. Every rule has an action 
associate with it that determines what to do whenever this rule 
matches.

It is very important to keep in mind that order matters, and that it is 
the first matching rule that gets used. Often times, you might add a 
line to do something really important, but place it too low in the file 
so that it never gets used in practice. The default preference file is 
very careful about the ordering of the rules it adds. With time and 
practice, you will be too! If you are adding a rule to automatically 
pickup a new kind of object, like we did with "Cure Critical Wounds" in 
the previous section, simply add it to the very top of the file. With 
that approach, you generally won't go wrong.

The second point was that each rule is a single line in the file. You 
probably noticed that not every line in the file corresponds to a rule, 
though. There are comments and blank lines, for example. There are also 
conditional tests, but we won't discuss those just now. Comments begin 
with a # key and are ignored by the system. They are displayed in 
green. The syntax of a rule is discussed in the next section.

The final point was the notion of an event, or a point in time when the 
game will attempt to apply a rule. In general, this happens whenever 
(1) the player moves on top of an object, (2) gets a pseudo-id for an 
object (see [c]) and (3) identifies an object (see [d]).

Rules

A rule is a single line that consists of an action to perform, a 
predicate to test matches, and an optional inscription to add. Let's 
discuss each of these in turn.

  Actions
  
  First of all, picking something up is the default action and is 
  inferred whenever you fail to specify an alternative. What are the 
  alternatives?
  
  !  Destroy
  ;  Prompt to Pickup
  ~  Leave on the Floor
  
  These are the primary actions. Pickup is assumed if you fail to type 
  !,; or ~.
  
  In addition there are the following command letters that augment the 
  primary action.
  
  (  Don't display this item in the Full Map
  ?  Automatically Identify this item
  
  The first one is not commonly used. Later in the game, your character 
  might have the power to map the entire level at once. If there is a 
  vault on the level, then many, many objects may match your pickup 
  rules. Were they all to be displayed in the Full Map view, there 
  would not be room to see them all, which can be annoying when that 
  5d5 long sword is not displayed but the potion of curing is. You'd 
  really, really prefer to hear about that sword! With the ( option, 
  you will still automatically pickup the matching object, it's just 
  that you won't get a text indicator in the Full Map screen. (But you 
  should probably use the Object List command too, since it shows all 
  matching objects in a scrollable list, sorted by object value).
  
  The second additional option (viz., ?) is very useful, since it 
  automatically identifies the matching object. This is a *HUGE* 
  timesaver ... when it works! But to work, you need to have either 
  scrolls or a device with the identify power. Spell casters are 
  currently out of luck :(
  
  All of the action command letters must be specified first in the line 
  for the rule, with one exception. The # letter indicates that you 
  wish to automatically inscribe matching objects, and it must occur at 
  the end of the rule, followed by the text to use for the actual 
  inscription. For example, #@ad!s!d!k at the end of a rule will 
  automatically inscribe @ad!s!d!k to any object matching the rule. If 
  you don't know what this inscription means, it is not really 
  important. You can see [e] for information about inscriptions.
  
  Matching
  Matching is the most important part of a rule. We saw above that 
  matching is by string comparison with the object name, but you can be 
  more specific than that if you want. To do so, use the following 
  keywords to construct a predicate used to test objects. The keyword 
  portion of the match consists of zero or more adjectives modifying a 
  noun that indicates the broad class of objects which should be 
  considered. In addition, you can specify a free form text comparison 
  string by adjoining : followed by text to search for. We'll put all 
  of this together in the examples section below.
  
  Let's do nouns first. A complete list is presented at the end of this 
  document, but some common nouns to get us started include:
  
  Items     Applies to everything. This is useful for very general 
            rules, such as ~?Unidentified Items to automatically 
            identify, but leave on the ground, everything not yet 
            identified.
  Weapons   Applies to all melees weapons, but not to missile weapons.
  Shooters  Applies to all missile weapons, including bows, slings and 
            crossbows.
  Armors    Applies to all forms of armor, including shields, helms, 
            cloaks as well as body armor.
  Wands     Applies to magical devices that are wands
  Staves    Applies to magical devices that are staves
  Rods      Applies to magical devices that are rods
  Potions   Applies to potions
  Scrolls   Applies to scrolls
  
  If you are using keywords to build a match predicate, then you must 
  specify exactly one noun. But you may use as many adjectives as you 
  like. The complete list of adjectives is given in the reference 
  section of this document, but here are some of the more common ones:
  
  Unaware      Applies to objects that the player is unaware of. In 
               practice, this currently only includes mushrooms, 
               potions and scrolls that the player has not yet 
               encountered.
  Unidentified Applies to objects that have not yet been identified.
  Ego          Applies to all excellent objects.
  Dice Boosted When used with Weapons or Shooters, this adjective 
               indicates that the object has higher damage dice than 
               usual. Archers in particular should be on the lookout 
               for Dice Boosted Shooters!
  Wanted       Combine with Corpses or Skeletons to indicated that the 
               corpse or skeleton belongs to a wanted monster. These 
               may be turned in at the Hunter's Office for a prize.
  
  As an example of using multiple adjectives, the phrase unidentified 
  ego weapons applies to, well, all melee weapons that are both 
  excellent and not yet identified. Of course this means that you must 
  have gotten a psuedo-id on the object in order to be aware that the 
  object is excellent, since it is not yet identified. Still, this is a 
  very useful phrase when combined with the ? command letter!
  
  Finally, use a search string to further refine the match. If you 
  don't use any adjective or noun keywords, then the entire text of 
  your rule (starting after any command letters, and including all text 
  up to the # inscription character) is used as the search string. If 
  you are using keywords, then you will need to mark the end of the 
  keyword section with the : separator letter. Examples are discussed 
  below.
  
  Examples
  
  There will be a quiz on this later, so make sure you understand the 
  following examples!
  
  !potions:apple juice
    Destroy potions of apple juice (Who would want those?). It uses the 
    ! command letter for destruction, the potions keyword to apply to 
    an entire class of objects, the : separator key, and an arbitrary 
    text field to use for a string match against the object name.
  
  ?unaware items
    Pickup and automatically identify unaware items (e.g. a potion 
    you've never seen before). Note that the pickup action is implied 
    since none of the other primary actions are indicated, and even 
    though there is a secondary action (to auto-id). This command uses 
    the adjective unaware to modify the noun items. You could narrow 
    down the applicability of this rule by using a more specific noun, 
    such as rings or potions.
  
  wanted corpses#Wanted!k!k!k
    Pickup wanted corpses. These are corpses that you may turn in at 
    the Hunter's Office for a prize. Automatically inscribe these 
    objects with Wanted!k!k!k. If you don't know what !k means, see [f] 
    (OK, it means to prompt the user when using the k command to 
    destroy objects. So, if you are paranoid and don't want to destroy 
    something by mistake, you inscribe !k on it. In this case, whoever 
    wrote this rule was really paranoid, since you will be prompted 
    three times to confirm destruction!).
  
  potions:resistance#!k!q
    Pickup all potions whose name contains the word "resistance". 
    Automatically inscribe !k!q on these objects. In effect, this rule 
    matches potions of resistance, but rather than using a string match 
    of "potion of resistance" on all items, it uses a string match of 
    "resistance" only on potions. Either approach would work equally 
    well in this instance, but sometimes it is better to use the 
    appropriate noun for the match, especially if you are dealing with 
    objects that might come as ego items, as the next example 
    indicates. Also, if you string match using "potions of resistance" 
    by mistake, your rule will not work. Why it fails is left as an 
    exercise for the reader!
  
  ?staves:destruction#@ud!s!d!k
    Pickup and automatically identify all staves whose name contains 
    the word "destruction". Inscribe these objects with @ud!s!d!k as 
    well. Note that using the noun staves with a string match on 
    "destruction" works more reliably then a string match on "staff: 
    destruction". Why this is the case will become apparent the first 
    time you find a "staff of power: destruction".
  

Scenarios

After that last section, you should have complete mastery over 
individual rules. Now, it is time to step up one level and apply 
multiple rules to accomplish common tasks. Ready?

  Scenario #1: Handling Objects
  
  In this scenario, you would like to handle the stream of objects in 
  the most efficient way possible. Let's begin with the following 
  rules:
    (unidentified armors
    (unidentified weapons
  
  These rules say to pickup all armor and weapons not yet identified. 
  That leaves out many types of objects, like potions and scrolls, but 
  this scenario is just focusing on objects for which you might receive 
  a pseudo-id. We use the ( command letter to prevent the Full Map 
  Screen from filling up with stuff not yet known to be desirable. But 
  the auto-pickup is very nice, since items need to be in your pack for 
  pseudo-id to kick in (until CL35, at least).
  
  Now, lets add the following rules:
    !average common weapons
    !average common armors
  
  In practice, we wouldn't want these right away since they say to 
  destroy common stuff. You can handle that with conditionals, which I 
  haven't discussed yet. For the moment, assume your character is 
  advanced enough to not want to keep average equipment. These rules 
  will fire once pseudo-id kicks in, destroying junk. (Of course, junk 
  is relative, and you may want to keep some stuff). The common 
  adjective prevents these rules from applying to rare average items, 
  like dragon scale mail, or blades of chaos.
  
  So, now our character is merrily picking up all equipment and then 
  auto-destroying the average stuff once pseudo-id kicks in. Can we do 
  more? Well, try adding:
    ?unidentified ego items
  
  Now, the egos are automatically being identified on psuedo-id as 
  well. Pretty sweet! Finally, eventually you will learn that some ego 
  types are junk, and perhaps would have auto registered some lines 
  like:
  
    (!common ego cloaks:of protection
    (!common ego weapons:of *slay* orc
    etc.
  
  So that even the junk excellent items are being toasted for you, 
  automatically, with nary a keystroke on your part. But, sometimes 
  egos become dice boosted, and the *slay* orc weapon might mean 
  something to you if it is really powerful. You can protect it with
    dice boosted weapons
  or perhaps even
    weapons more dice than 30
  but that last one is an advanced maneuver.
  
  In summary, the complete order of your rules might be:
    weapons more dice than 30
    ?unidentified ego items
  
    !average common weapons
    !average common armors
  
    (unidentified armors
    (unidentified weapons
  
    (!common ego cloaks:of protection
    (!common ego weapons:of *slay* orc
  
  New armors and weapons come down and hit rule 5 or 6 when your 
  character steps on them, so they get placed into your pack 
  automatically (Remember, matching is based on your current knowledge 
  of the object, not what it truly is. So, when you find, say, a dagger 
  (+0, +0), it is not immediately destroyed since it is unidentified 
  and not yet pseudo-identified: You don't yet know it is average!). 
  Eventually, pseudo-id will kick in revealing the object as average, 
  in which case it is destroyed by rule 3 or rule 4, or as excellent, 
  in which case it is processed by rule 2 which auto-identifies the ego 
  item and rescans the rules. If it is a cloak of protection, it is 
  destroyed by rule 7, while if it is a weapon of *slay* orc, it is 
  destroyed by rule 8. Unless it happened to be hugely dice boosted, in 
  which case it got protected by rule 1 (remember, rules are processed 
  in order). Easy, right? What happens to weapons/armors that psuedo-id 
  as {Good}? Or {Special}?
  
  Scenario #2: Flavored Objects
  This one is easier, and I'll give the full set of rules first:
    potions:healing#!k!q
    potions:of strength#!k
    potions:of intelligence#!k
    potions:of wisdom#!k
    potions:of dexterity#!k
    potions:of constitution#!k
    potions:of charisma#!k
    potions:augmentation#!k
  
    scrolls:artifact creation#!*
    ...
  
    ?unaware items
  
    collecting potions
    collecting scrolls
  
    ?:$AUTOREGISTER
    ...
    (!potions:^potion of restore charisma$
    (!scrolls:^scroll of treasure detection$
    ... <many more junk flavors auto-registered for destruction> ...
  
  Now, the pattern is wanted flavors on top for autopickup (and 
  inscription), unwanted flavors on bottom for autodestruction (these 
  are placed in your file automatically each time you press A while 
  destroying an object) and rules for collecting and unaware items in 
  the middle. Unaware items get automatically identified, at which 
  point one of the pickup or destroy rules might get a chance to act. 
  If this was a new flavor you find useless, destroy it and 
  autoregister it for destruction so you never see it again. As for the 
  collecting rules, those fire if you have another object of the same 
  flavor in your pack. Perhaps you are carrying potions of cure 
  critical wounds but don't have a rule specifically for this flavor. 
  In this case, the collecting rule will pickup these objects for you.
  
  Scenario #3: Spellbooks
  OK, this is the last one. See if you can figure this one out first:
    first realm's fourth spellbooks#@md!s!d!k
    first realm's third spellbooks#@mc!k
    ~first realm's second spellbooks#@mb!k
    ~first realm's first spellbooks#@ma!k
    second realm's fourth spellbooks#@mh!s!d!k
    second realm's third spellbooks#@mg!k
    ~second realm's second spellbooks#@mf!k
    ~second realm's first spellbooks#@me!k
    !first spellbooks
    !second spellbooks
    !third spellbooks:major arcana
    !fourth spellbooks:manual of mastery
    third spellbooks
    fourth spellbooks
  Did you figure it out? This scenario picks up high level spellbooks 
  from your player's realms of magics, leaves low level spellbooks from 
  your player's realms of magics, destroys all other low level 
  spellbooks, destroys all arcane magic spellbooks, but picks up high 
  level spellbooks from other realms (presumably to sell for gold). 
  Spellbooks from the player's realms are auto-inscribed to make 
  casting a spell from the appropriate book consistently use the same 
  letter to choose that book. Here, as elsewhere, order is very 
  important. Rules for the player's spell realms must come before the 
  general rules to destroy low level spellbooks. There is also an 
  unreadable adjective that would have made processing safer, and less 
  order dependant.
  
Which Rule is Being Used?

If you are ever unsure about which rule is being applied in a given 
situation, turn on the destroy_debug option (see [g]). With this option 
you can use the Inspect command for more information. For example:

  a Thieves' Guide [Burglar's Handbook]

    Autopick: (!unreadable first spellbooks

  6 Potions of Resist Cold
    You get temporary resistance to cold when you quaff it. This
    resistance is cumulative with equipment.

    Autopick: potions:resist#!k!q

In the first case, this is a line automatically added when I destroyed 
an unreadable spellbook using the k command. In the second case, this 
is a line that comes as a default setting. I may or may not like this 
behavior, and if I don't, now I know which line to change!

In addition, with debugging turned on, the rules used are printed in 
the message log as actions are taken, so you can see exactly why 
objects are being destroyed, picked up, left on the ground or 
auto-identified. For example:


  You have 26 charges remaining. (AutoID:~?unidentified rods) You see a 
  Rod: Frost Ball (1/3 charges). (Destroy:(!rods:frost ball$)
  Auto-destroying.

Also, you might want to check out the ~_ Knowledge Option. Like the 
editor, it displays the rules for you in the order they are processed. 
But it only displays the rules that are currently active, which can be 
a useful thing to see if you add a lot of conditional rules.

Conditional Rules

This is an advanced topic. If you play a lot, then you probably play 
many different types of characters. You probably have rules for objects 
that you would like to share across all of your characters. While other 
characters, depending on their class, might have special needs. 
Finally, you might have some rules that you use early in the game, and 
others that you would like to turn on towards the end of the game. You 
can accomplish all of this using conditional statements to guard your 
individual rule definitions. The conditions are evaluated each time 
your preference file is loaded to determine which rules to apply. Oh, 
and don't worry, the game automatically reloads the file for you each 
time your player gains an experience level, so your conditions get 
checked automatically without any intervention on your part.

Imagine scanning the entire preference file from top to bottom, 
building a list of all the player's rules. Imagine now that there 
exists a switch that can be turned on and off. If the switch is on, 
then every rule line you read gets added to the list of current rules. 
If the switch is off, then every rule line you read gets skipped. 
Finally, imagine there are lines in the file that can turn this switch 
on and off. If you can imagine all of that, then, aside from the fact 
you are probably a computer programmer, you can understand how 
conditional rules work.

The rule lines have already been discussed, and you are surely a master 
of them by now. So we really only need to consider those lines that can 
flip our global switch. These are called Conditional Lines and they 
always begin with the characters ?: followed by a (rather cryptic 
looking) expression.

Let's look at an example. Remember Scenario #1 above when we added 
lines to destroy average equipment? Well, in practice, you would 
probably want those rules to not be used in the early game. Perhaps 
once your character reaches a certain level, you would want to add 
them. Well, try the following instead:

  ?:[GEQ $LEVEL 20]
  !average common weapons
  !average common armors
  ?:1

Notice there are two lines colored in violet, each beginning with ?:. 
These are the Conditional Lines. The first one executes a funny looking 
expression while the second one is much simpler, albeit just as hard to 
fathom. In programming, one typically uses numbers to represent 
everything, and this case is no different. We represent the state of 
our global switch as a number. When it is 0, the switch is off. When it 
is nonzero, the switch is on. So the first conditional might or might 
not flip the switch. It depends on the value of $LEVEL (which you 
probably guessed is the player's current experience level) and whether 
or not it is >= 20. GEQ stands for greater than or equal to, and 20 is 
just a number. And the expression is presented in a funny order as [GEQ 
$LEVEL 20] rather than $LEVEL GEQ 20 (or even $LEVEL >= 20). You might 
not find this odd, but if that is the case, then you probably (like me) 
enjoy programming in LISP or Scheme. In these languages, functions are 
always expressed as (f x y z) to evaluate the function f with the 
arguments x, y and z. And >= is a function just like any other (it 
returns a number which we think of as a boolean value, being either 
non-zero for TRUE, or zero for FALSE). You can also nest calls. Perhaps 
x must be computed as (g u v) which calls function g with arguments u 
and v. Then, instead of (f x y z) you write (f (g u v) y z). Got it?

Now make those parentheses square as [f [g u v] y z], tag variables 
with a leading $ so our parser can figure things out, rename operators 
with three letter abbreviations, "turn up the volume" making everything 
uppercase, and you will finally understand [GEQ $LEVEL 20].

In contrast, ?:1 is easy. Like any good Scheme wannabe, literal values 
are self evaluating. Which is just a fancy way of saying that the value 
of 1 is itself, viz. 1. No confusion. And 1 means true, which means 
turn the switch back on in case the first Conditional Line turned it 
off. And in case it isn't obvious, the switch is always turned on 
before starting the scan, so you don't need a ?:1 at the top of the 
file.

Here's another, more complicated example:
  ?:[OR [EQU $CLASS Mage High-Mage Sorcerer] [EQU $RACE Beholder Lich] ]
  wizardstaff
  ?:1
That's a complicated expression to determine who wants to gather a 
wizardstaff, but I'm willing to bet you can figure it out without 
waiting for my explanation. In words, if the player's class is either a 
Mage, High-Mage or a Sorcerer; or if the player's race is either a 
Beholder or a Lich, then the player wants a wizardstaff (rather badly, 
actually). So we really have the expression (or a b) where a and b are 
computed values using subexpressions to test the player's class or race 
(and you should try playing a Beholder sometime; they are quite fun!).

So, we have expressions composed of functions, variables, literals and 
parentheses. What are the functions and variables we can use?

Function  Explanation
  IOR     Inclusive Or: [IOR a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of any 
          subexpression a, b, c, ... is TRUE.
  OR      Same as IOR. One day I was puzzled why my [OR ...] expression 
          wasn't working. Also, if you are going to have IOR, it 
          suggests you will have XOR (Exclusive Or) as well, and we 
          don't!
  AND     Logical And: [AND a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of all 
          subexpressions a, b, c, ... are TRUE.
  NOT     [NOT a] is TRUE if a is FALSE, and vice versa. Use this when 
          you want to take an action when something is not true.
  EQU     [EQU v a b c ...] is TRUE when the value of v is one of the 
          values a, b, c, ... Comparison is by string. Typically, you 
          use this with v being a built-in variable expression, like 
          $CLASS (see below) and the remaining arguments to EQU being 
          strings to test, like Warrior or Rogue. Note that string 
          literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain spaces.
  LEQ     [LEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is less than or 
          equal to the integer value of a. Note that while EQU treats 
          its arguments as strings, LEQ treats them as numbers.
  GEQ     [GEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is greater than 
          or equal to the integer value of a. Note that while EQU 
          treats its arguments as strings, GEQ treats them as numbers. 
          For example, use [GEQ $LEVEL 20] to test if the player's 
          current level is greater than, or equal to 20.

Variable  Explanation
$RACE     Returns the name of the player's race. For example, Snotling 
          or High-Elf.
$CLASS    Returns the name of the player's class. For example, 
          Warrior-Mage or Mindcrafter. Note, if you are playing in 
          Monster mode, then this variable always returns Monster, 
          while $RACE returns the actual monster race you are playing, 
          such as Lich or Dragon.
$REALM1   Returns the name of the player's first realm, if any. For 
          example, Chaos or Sorcery. If the player does not have a 
          first realm, then this variable returns none.
$REALM2   Returns the name of the player's second realm, if any. For 
          example, Life or Death. If the player does not have a second 
          realm, then this variable returns none.
$LEVEL    Returns the player's current level. Typically, you combine 
          this with GEQ or LEQ to test the level against a threshold, 
          such as [LEQ $LEVEL 34].
$MONEY    Returns the amount of gold the player has. Like $LEVEL, use 
          this with GEQ or LEQ to test whether your player is rich or 
          poor.

As mentioned before, all variables begin with a $ character to 
distinguish them from string literals.

Literal   Explanation
Number    Numbers are written like 105 or 32.
String    Strings are written like High-Mage or Beholder. Note that 
          string literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain 
          spaces.

Using the Editor

We've gotten this far, and I bet you've been using the built in 
preference editor just fine. It is pretty easy to use, and you can 
probably figure it out on your own. Like any text editor you have used, 
you move the cursor about with the arrow keys and then type when you 
have located the correct position. Navigation keys like HOME and END 
might not be standard, since they take you to the top or bottom of the 
document, rather than the beginning or end of the current line, but 
you'll get used to the various quirks.

I really don't feel a need to document the editor at all, since it has 
a complete menu structure which you can browse and learn all the 
commands. Simply press ESC to get started and then follow the various 
options. For example:

(a-j) Command:
#*** +---------------------------+
#*** | a) Help                   |Picker Editor for the first time.
#*** | b) Quit without save   ^Q |opick is not yet created,

#*** | d) Re| a) Left     (Left Arrow key)  ^B |
     | e) Ed| b) Down     (Down Arrow key)  ^N |

# Con| g) Mo| d) Right    (Right Arrow key) ^F |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This line is a comment.

Here, you can clearly see what commands to use to move the cursor about 
(And if you are running on the Curses platform, you'll notice that 
arrow keys don't work so you'll need to learn the control key 
alternatives).

One comment I will make on the editor is that it colors each rule line 
according to the syntax of the expression. I personally find this 
rather useful. However, sometimes the text displayed is not the same as 
the rule you actually typed in, even though the meaning is the same. 
For example, if you use multiple adjectives, then they might get 
reordered when they are drawn with syntax coloring. In order to avoid 
confusion, the current line (viz. the line under the cursor) is never 
syntax colored and always displays exactly what you typed.

Reference Tables

This section will give all the nitty gritty syntax details for The 
Mogaminator. But first, where are those preference files located 
anyway? The default preferences are initialized from 
lib/pref/pickpref.prf which is located in your game's directory 
structure. If you don't like the defaults that I have provided and 
would like to use your own, then this is the file to edit. Once you 
enable the system, your preferences are stored in a separate file in a 
system dependant location. On Windows, they will be stored in 
lib/user/pickpref-NAME.prf inside the game's directory structure, while 
on Linux, they can be found in 
~/.angband/PosChengband/pickpref-NAME.prf (outside the game's directory 
structure). Here, NAME is replaced with your player's current name. So 
if you want to edit your preferences using some other text editor, this 
is the file you need to change. If you do edit preferences outside of 
the game while you are playing, then be sure to use the $ command to 
force the game to reload the preference file.

OK, so I promised you reference tables. I'm a man of my word, so here 
they are. Enjoy!

Table I: Line Types in the Editor
  Type        Explanation
  Comment     These lines begin with a # and are ignored by the system. 
              Feel free to add them whenever you want to document what 
              you are trying to do so that you can better understand 
              the file in the future. I like to add comments to 
              visually break the file up into different sections, such 
              as Consumables, Weapons, Armor and Devices.
  
  Conditional These lines flip the global processing switch ON and OFF. 
              If the expression evaluates to TRUE, then the switch is 
              turned ON and any subsequent rules will be included. If 
              the expression evaluates to FALSE, the switch is turned 
              OFF and any subsequent rules will be ignored. Use 
              Conditional Lines so that your rule base adapts to the 
              variety of classes and situations that you encounter. If 
              this is gibberish to you, then you probably skipped the 
              section [h] above!
  
  Rule        Every other line, unless it is blank, is a rule. The 
              syntax of a rule is described in the following 5 tables.
  
Table II: Rules: Syntax
  Rules have one of the following two syntactic forms:
  [Commands] Adjective* Noun Special-Clause* [:Search-String] 
    [#Inscription-String]
  
  [Commands] Search-String [#Inscription-String]
  
  Square brackets denote optional syntactic elements. * is the 
  Kleene-Star and indicates that 0 or more of the preceding syntactic 
  elements may be specified. All rules must be specified on a single 
  line in your preference file.
  
  Syntactic Element  Explanation
  Commands           These are actions to take whenever this rule 
                     matches. They are built up with command leters as 
                     described in the next table. If this element is 
                     omitted, then this rule will pickup any matching 
                     objects.
  
  Adjective          These modify Nouns, further narrowing down the set 
                     of objects that will match this rule.
  
  Noun               A single noun is always specified for the first 
                     syntactic form and indicates the broad class of 
                     objects to which this rule shall apply.
  
  Special-Clause     These consist of further rule match refinements 
                     and are discussed below. They are like adjectives 
                     in that they modify nouns, but they also involve 
                     some sort of numerical comparison of an object 
                     attribute, and therefore require special syntax. 
                     They also always follow the Noun while Adjectives 
                     precede the Noun.
  
  Search-String      This is a free form text value to compare against 
                     the object's name. Comparison is by string and is 
                     case-insensitive. In addition, you may use the ^ 
                     special character at the beginning of a 
                     Search-String to force your match to the beginning 
                     of an object name, and the $ special character at 
                     the end of a Search-String to force your match to 
                     the end of the object name. For example, ^Foo will 
                     only match objects whose names begin with Foo, and 
                     will skip other objects that might have Foo 
                     somewhere in the name, but not at the beginning. 
                     Similarly, Bar$ only matches objects whose name 
                     ends with Bar and skips any that might have Bar 
                     someplace in the middle of its name. Finally note 
                     that an object's name is always in the singular. 
                     So, for example, Seeker Bolt would work for a 
                     string match, but Seeker Bolts would always fail.
  
  Inscription-String This is a free form text value that will be 
                     automatically inscribed on any object matching 
                     this rule.
  
  If you didn't understand some of that, you should probably review the 
  tutorial sections above, starting with [i]. The examples section 
  above, in particular, is probably the best way to learn what is going 
  on.
  
Table III: Rules: Command Letters
  Letter  Type       Explanation
    !     Primary    Destroy
    ;     Primary    Prompt to Pickup
    ~     Primary    Leave on the Floor
          Primary    Pickup is assumed if you fail to provide an 
                     alternative primary command letter. There is no 
                     command letter for this action, it is simply the 
                     default action to take unless overridden.
    (     Secondary  Don't display this item in the Full Map Screen.
    ?     Secondary  Automatically Identify this item. This requires 
                     you to carry scrolls or magical devices with the 
                     Identify power. It does not currently work for 
                     spellcasters.
    #     Terminal   Auto-inscribe matching objects with whatever text 
                     follows this key. Note that Primary and Secondary 
                     command letters must be placed at the beginning of 
                     a rule line, while Terminal command letters must 
                     be placed at the end of a rule line.
  
  Every rule must have one Primary action. It can have 0 or more 
  secondary actions, and the sole Terminal action is also optional.
  
Table IV: Rules: Nouns
  Noun       Explanation
  Items      Applies to everything. This is useful for very general 
             rules, such as ~?Unidentified Items to automatically 
             identify, but leave on the ground, everything not yet 
             identified.
  
  Weapons    Applies to all melees weapons, but not to missile weapons. 
             If you are a veteran player, then read that description 
             again. This noun used to include shooters, but I just 
             recently changed the semantics to accomodate archers who 
             are very interested in Dice Boosted Shooters but could 
             usually care less about Dice Boosted Weapons. Also, monks 
             may want to !Weapons since they usually fight bare-handed, 
             and having this rule also destroy shooters is quite 
             annoying.
  
  Favorite Weapons
             Applies to all weapons, including shooters, that are 
             desired by your class. For example, Weaponmasters 
             specialize in a given class of weapons, such as Axes or 
             Crossbows. Whatever their speciality, this "noun" will 
             apply to these preferred items. Calling this "keyword" a 
             noun is a bit of a misnomer, but it will help you to think 
             of Favorite Weapons as a single word that is a Noun, since 
             the code treats it that way! For example, saying Ego 
             Favorite Weapons is syntactically correct, while Favorite 
             Ego Weapons is not. (There is no adjective called 
             Favorite).
  
  Hafted Weapons
             Applies to all hafted weapons like Maces, Flails and War 
             Hammers. These weapons are preferred by Priests who 
             disdain other kinds of weapons, such as Swords or 
             Polearms. Like the Favorite Weapons "noun" above, it helps 
             to think of Hafted Weapons as a single word that is a 
             Noun, since the code treats it that way (There is no 
             adjective Hafted). If you are a priest interested in 
             excellent and artifact hafted weapons, you need to say Ego 
             Hafted Weapons or Artifact Hafted Weapons to get the job 
             done.
  
  Diggers    Applies to all digging implements, such as shovels and 
             picks. Digging is fun, but eventually you will probably 
             want to destroy these objects. Perhaps, you would like the 
             rule ~Dice Boosted Diggers:Mattock followed by the rule 
             !Diggers?
  
  Shooters   Applies to all missile weapons, including bows, slings and 
             crossbows. It also includes harps and guns. If you are a 
             Bard, then you might consider Shooters:Harp as a pickup 
             preference, while if you are ignoring archery altogether, 
             try Shooters:Gun instead since the guns are quite useful 
             for resistances and boosting stats.
  
  Ammo       Applies to all ammunition for missile weapons: arrows, 
             shots and bolts. Consider using Ammo:Seeker or 
             Ammo:Mithril or Ammo:Steel to pick out desirable ammo.
  
  Armors     Applies to all forms of armor, including shields, helms, 
             cloaks as well as body armor. You can narrow down the 
             range of armor objects by using a more specific noun from 
             the following list:
             Suits   Applies to body armor
             Shields Applies to shields
             Cloaks  Applies to cloaks
             Helms   Applies to helmets and crowns
             Gloves  Applies to gloves
             Boots   Applies to boots
             Consider using Armors:Dragon to pickup all the various 
             forms of dragon armor, including dragon boots, gloves, 
             helmets and wings. If you are playing a class with armor 
             weight restrictions, check out the More Weight Than NN 
             special clause below.
  
  Wands      Applies to magical devices that are wands. Use 
             Wands:Rockets to get all wands, including ego and artifact 
             wands, that can fire rockets (Trust me: You want them!). 
             Note: We no longer have a noun Magical Devices.
  
  Staves     Applies to magical devices that are staves. For example, 
             try Staves:Healing or Staves:Speed.
  
  Rods       Applies to magical devices that are rods.
  
  Potions    Applies to potions. There are many useful potions. If you 
             are trying to get stat potions, you might consider 
             Potions:of Strength rather than just Potions:Strength, 
             since the latter will also match potions of restore 
             strength.
  
  Scrolls    Applies to scrolls
  
  Rings      Applies to jewelry that are rings. Since rings are so 
             useful, I like the rule ?Unidentified Rings for all of my 
             characters.
  
  Amulets    Applies to jewelry that are amulets. Like rings, I prefer 
             to keep the rule ?Unidentified Amulets for all of my 
             characters.
  
  Lights     These are torches, lanterns and feanorian lamps, as well 
             as the various artifact light sources. If you are looking 
             for the Jewel of Judgment, try using Lights:Jewel.
  
  Spellbooks These are all the spellbooks, for all of the various 
             magical realms. If you are a spellcaster, you will 
             invariably want to make use of the numerous spellbook 
             specific adjectives described in the next table.
  
  Junk       Need I say more? You probably just need !Junk in your pref 
             file, though some junk might be useful for some players.
  
  Corpses    Corpses actually can be useful. For one thing, every 
             player can turn in Wanted Corpses at the Hunter's Office 
             for prizes. And then there are possessors, a monster race 
             that can actually possess the corpse of a slain foe and 
             gain the powers of that monster type. They will want to 
             make use of rules like ~Corpses More Level Than 20 which 
             uses a special form described below. Of course, they will 
             tweak the level threshold of corpses they wish to keep as 
             the game progresses, and they also need to be careful to 
             keep rather than pickup these desirable objects: Corpses 
             can be very heavy! Note that Skeletons no longer count as 
             corpses, mainly because Possessors cannot possess 
             skeletons so they require a more specific keyword. If you 
             are a hungry demon, you might consider Human Corpses.
  
  Skeletons  Like corpses, you may turn in Wanted Skeletons at the 
             Hunter's Office. Archers may also use skeletons to make 
             arrows and bolts, so this class of objects is not as 
             useless as you might have thought.
  
  If you are using keywords to build a match predicate, then you must 
  specify exactly one noun. But you may use as many adjectives as you 
  like.
  
Table V: Rules: Adjectives
  There are many adjectives, and perhaps it might be useful to group 
  them by kind?
  
  Object Knowledge
  Unsensed     Applies to objects that have not yet been identified nor 
               even pseudo-identified. In this sense, it is more 
               inclusive then the Unidentified adjective. Use a rule 
               like (Unsensed Weapons to (i) automatically pickup newly 
               dropped weapons so that you can pseudo-id them in your 
               pack in the early to mid game; and (ii) automatically 
               travel to newly dropped weapons in the remainder of the 
               game using the newly enhanced get objects command (Turn 
               on auto_get_objects).  If destroy_feeling is turned on, 
               the set of rules will be rescanned once the given item 
               is sensed, either in your pack at some future time 
               (prior to CL35) or by stepping on the same square as the 
               object (once you reach CL35).  If destroy_identify is 
               turned on, the set of rules will be rescanned once you 
               identify the object.
  
  Unidentified Applies to objects that have not yet been identified and 
               is a very useful adjective. For example, ?Unidentified 
               Items has to be my favorite rule of all time!
  
  Identified   Applies all objects that have been identified. You might 
               use this with a rule like !Identified Weapons, preceded 
               by rules to protect weapons you actually care about, 
               like dice boosted ego items, for example. But I think it 
               is almost always preferable to use a !Nameless Common 
               Weapons rule instead, since it is much safer (e.g. It 
               won't destroy rare objects like Blades of Chaos and 
               won't destroy egos either).
  
  *Identified* Applies to fully identified objects, and is rarely 
               needed. Perhaps you might consider a block of rules 
               like:
               ~*identified* rings more value than 5000
               ~*identified* amulets more value than 5000
               ~?unidentified rings
               ~?unidentified amulets
               !identified rings
               !identified amulets
               But this requires you to have a good sense of the value 
               threshold for jewelry you might want. Also note that 
               this rule set is safe because, in the current version, 
               identifying jewelry also *identifies* it. Do not try 
               this pattern with other types of objects!
  
  Unaware      Applies to objects that the player is unaware of. In 
               practice, this currently only includes mushrooms, 
               potions and scrolls that the player has not yet 
               encountered. A rule like ?Unaware Items will help you 
               learn all those flavors in the early game.
  
  Object Quality
  Average      Just like the name says, this adjective matches average 
               items. These are items that lack any form of magical 
               bonus or enhancment. This adjective is best combined 
               with the ! command letter at a very early point in the 
               game :)
  
  Good         Good items have a magical bonus of some kind, either a 
               combat bonus to hit or damage for weapons and shooters, 
               or an armor class bonus for armors. You might want to 
               hang on to these objects a bit longer since they can be 
               sold for gold in the town, but even here, you will want 
               to destroy them eventually. I usually use the rule 
               !Nameless Common Weapons rather than the Good adjective, 
               since Nameless will include average items as well, while 
               the Common adjective protects objects that are rare and 
               might still be useful, even if they are only Average or 
               Good (e.g. Dragon Scale Mail).
  
  Ego          Applies to all excellent objects. See [j] for more 
               information.
  
  Artifact     Artifacts are special items and are unique. Think of 
               them as super-ego objects that you can only find one of 
               in each game you play. I almost never use this 
               adjective, though, since you cannot destroy artifacts 
               anyway. Perhaps you might like to auto-identify them, 
               though, and a rule like ?Artifact Items would accomplish 
               this.
  
  Cursed       Cursed items aren't necessarily all bad. Still, you 
               might want rules to handle these objects, for example, 
               to destroy them. Also note that objects can be Cursed 
               Ego Items or even Cursed Artifact Items, so perhaps the 
               rule you are looking for is !Cursed Nameless Common 
               Items.
  
  Nameless     Nameless applies to any object that is neither an 
               artifact nor an ego item. This adjective is commonly 
               used to destroy stuff that you know won't be 
               particularly good, usually as a rule of the form 
               !Nameless Common Items.
  
  Rare         Rare items are special objects that don't show up often, 
               and might still be desirable even if they are Nameless. 
               For example, and hopefully this won't spoil too much, 
               weapons like Blades of Chaos and armors like Dragon 
               Scale Mail are considered Rare.
  
  Common       Common includes any object that is not Rare. So, a Long 
               Sword is common, but a Blade of Chaos is not. Metal 
               Scale Mail is common, but White Dragon Scale Mail is 
               not.
  
  Worthless    Any object whose value is 0 is considered Worthless. 
               This doesn't necessarily mean you want to destroy it, 
               though. For example, Corpses are worthless, but you 
               still want some of them. In general, you will want rules 
               to protect the worthless items you might want, and then, 
               at the very bottom of your preference file, you add a 
               rule !Worthless Items.
  
  Object Attributes
  Dice Boosted When used with Weapons or Shooters, this adjective 
               indicates that the object has higher damage dice than 
               usual. Archers in particular should be on the lookout 
               for Dice Boosted Shooters!
  
  See the Special Clauses below for more information about matching on 
  an object's attributes.
  
  Spellbook Adjectives
  Unreadable     This will match spellbooks that you cannot use, either 
                 because you are playing a non-magical class, or 
                 because you did not choose to learn that particular 
                 magical realm at birth. The most common use for this 
                 adjective is for destruction purposes, as in 
                 !Unreadable Spellbooks.
  
  First Realm's  This refers to your primary magical realm. For many 
                 players, this is their only magic realm. For example, 
                 if you are playing a High-Mage, Paladin, Monk, Rogue 
                 or Chaos-Warrior, then you can pick a single realm of 
                 magic at birth.
  
  Second Realm's This refers to your secondary magical realm. If you 
                 are playing a Mage, Priest or Ranger, then you can 
                 pick two realms of magic at birth. The most common 
                 reason to distinguish between your first and second 
                 realms of magic has to do with inscriptions. 
                 Typically, players inscribe @ma through @md, in order, 
                 on their first realm's spellbooks, and use @me through 
                 @mh, in order, on their second realm's spellbooks. Or 
                 you might use @m1 through @m8 if you prefer.
  
  First
  Second
  Third
  Fourth         Each realm of magic has four possible spellbooks. 
                 These adjectives refer to each of these possibilities. 
                 For every school except Arcane, only the first and 
                 second spellbooks are available in town, while the 
                 third and fourth spellbooks must be found in the 
                 dungeon. They can be quite rare, and are also valuable 
                 objects, so one typically wants to distinguish between 
                 first and second spellbooks on the one hand, and third 
                 and fourth on the other. Also, combine these 
                 adjectives with the First Realm's and Second Realm's 
                 adjectives discussed above in order to get your 
                 inscriptions setup properly (see Scenario #3 above).
  
  Corpse Adjectives
  Wanted       Combine with Corpses or Skeletons to indicate that the 
               corpse or skeleton belongs to a wanted monster. These 
               may be turned in at the Hunter's Office for a prize.
  
  Unique       Combine with Corpses or Skeletons to indicate that the 
               corpse or skeleton belongs to a unique monster. Not all 
               unique monsters are Wanted, so many players would 
               consider them to be junk (They are destroyed by the 
               default rule !Worthless Items). However, other players 
               enjoy collecting the corpses of unique monsters, and 
               placing them on display at the museum. For these 
               (strange?) folks, adding a rule like ~Unique Corpses 
               before the !Worthless Items will protect them from 
               default destruction.
  
  Human        And then there are those character's that require the 
               corpses of humans for either food, or as part of a 
               ritual to summon a powerful demonic ally. For these 
               situations, add a rule like ~Human Corpses to your 
               preferences, though ~Special Items also works.
  
  Miscellaneous
  Collecting   Collecting Items are stackable objects that you happen 
               to currently be carrying in your pack. Use this broad 
               adjective when you don't feel like adding a more 
               specific rule. For example, you might currently be 
               carrying Potions of Cure Serious Wounds, and would like 
               to collect those if you happen to find them. But since 
               these objects are only useful for a very small portion 
               of the game, you don't want to use a conditional rule to 
               handle this.
  
  Special      Special Items are objects your race or class needs; 
               objects that are usually considered junk by default. For 
               example, some players cannot eat normal food, but must 
               consume the corpses of humans (Yuk!). Other players use 
               corpses for various spells, and need to keep them 
               around. Archers use skeletons to make their own ammo. 
               And classes that ride pets into battle actually enjoy 
               using devices that haste monsters. All of these special 
               scenarios are handled with this adjective.
  
  Unusable     This adjective applies to wearable items that your 
               current character is unable to wear. Doe this sound 
               strange? It is, but remember that you have the option to 
               play the game as a Monster, and monsters often have 
               unusual body types. For example, a Dragon can wear 
               rings, amulets, lights, cloaks and helmets, but nothing 
               else. So weapons, shooters, body armor, shields, gloves, 
               and boots are all considered Unusable. Adding a rule 
               like !Unusable Items makes the game much more pleasant, 
               at least once the player is past the point of worrying 
               too much about gold. (They could also use a rule like 
               !Unusable Nameless Items if they wanted to keep egos for 
               resale purposes).
  
Table VI: Rules: Special Clauses
  In the following clauses, N refers to a numerical digit, 0 through 9. 
  The sequence NN means you may type one or two digits, and can 
  therefore enter any number between 0 and 99.  The sequence NNNNNN 
  means you may type from one to six digits, and can therefore enter 
  any number between 0 and 999999. If you enter too many digits, then 
  the parser will not recognize your special clause, and you will get 
  unsatisfactory results from your rule.
  
  Special Clause          Explanation
  More Dice Than NN       This clause applies to Weapons only, and is 
                          true whenever the maximum possible damage 
                          exceeds the number you enter. For example a 
                          (2d5) weapon will match More Dice Than 9 but 
                          will fail to match More Dice Than 10.
  
  More Bonus Than NN      An object's bonus is the largest of its pval, 
                          its bonus to hit, to damage and to armor 
                          class. Confused? Well, the rule Rings More 
                          Bonus Than 9:Speed will pickup rings of speed 
                          (+10) or better, but will not match other 
                          rings of speed. Another (sarcastic) example: 
                          Suits More Bonus Than 19:Power Dragon says 
                          that you would like Power Dragon Scale Mail, 
                          but only if its bonus to armor class is +20 
                          or better!
  
  More Level Than NN      This clause is intended to be used on Corpses 
                          so that Possessors can manage the mountains 
                          of dead bodies they create. You can also use 
                          it with other objects, in which case it 
                          corresponds to the level of the object, or 
                          its ego type. For devices, it matches against 
                          the power level of the device.
  
  More Weight Than NN     Some classes have weight restrictions on 
                          armor, like Monks, Scouts and Ninjas. Other 
                          classes, like Maulers, prefer very heavy 
                          weapons. This clause matches against the 
                          weight of the object, in pounds. So Weapons 
                          More Weight Than 39 will match weapons at 
                          least 39.1 lbs in weight (In practice, this 
                          means at least 40.0 lbs in weight).
  
  More Value Than NNNNNN This clause matches against the known value of 
                         the object. Use it with care, since unknown, 
                         or even un-*identified* objects may have 
                         disturbingly low known values.
  
Table VII: Conditional Lines: Syntax
  Conditional Lines have the following syntactic form:
  
  ?:Expression
  
  Conditional Expressions use the following (partial) grammar:
  
  Expression := Literal | Variable | [Function Expression*]
  Function   := IOR | OR | AND | NOT | EQU | LEQ | GEQ
  Variable   := $RACE | $CLASS | $REALM1 | $REALM2 | $LEVEL | $MONEY | 
                  ...
  Literal    := 23 | 52 | Rage-Mage | High-Elf | ... 
  
  Note that unlike above, square brackets are part of the syntax of 
  expressions and do not indicate optional elements in the grammar. 
  Rather, function application expressions are always surrounded with 
  square brackets.
  
  When the expression on a conditional line evaluates to FALSE or 0, 
  then any subsequent rules will be ignored. When the expression 
  evaluates to TRUE or non-zero, then any subsequent rules will be 
  applied.
  
  If none of this makes sense, see [k] above.
  
Table VIII: Conditional Lines: Functions
  Function  Explanation
    IOR     Inclusive Or: [IOR a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of any 
            subexpression a, b, c, ... is TRUE.
    OR      Same as IOR. One day I was puzzled why my [OR ...] 
            expression wasn't working. Also, if you are going to have 
            IOR, it suggests you will have XOR (Exclusive Or) as well, 
            and we don't!
    AND     Logical And: [AND a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of all 
            subexpressions a, b, c, ... are TRUE.
    NOT     [NOT a] is TRUE if a is FALSE, and vice versa. Use this 
            when you want to take an action when something is not true.
    EQU     [EQU v a b c ...] is TRUE when the value of v is one of the 
            values a, b, c, ... Comparison is by string. Typically, you 
            use this with v being a built-in variable expression, like 
            $CLASS (see below) and the remaining arguments to EQU being 
            strings to test, like Warrior or Rogue. Note that string 
            literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain 
            spaces.
    LEQ     [LEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is less than 
            or equal to the integer value of a. Note that while EQU 
            treats its arguments as strings, LEQ treats them as 
            numbers.
    GEQ     [GEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is greater 
            than or equal to the integer value of a. Note that while 
            EQU treats its arguments as strings, GEQ treats them as 
            numbers. For example, use [GEQ $LEVEL 20] to test if the 
            player's current level is greater than, or equal to 20.
  
Table IX: Conditional Lines: Variables
  Variable  Explanation
  $RACE     Returns the name of the player's race. For example, 
            Snotling or High-Elf.
  $CLASS    Returns the name of the player's class. For example, 
            Warrior-Mage or Mindcrafter. Note, if you are playing in 
            Monster mode, then this variable always returns Monster, 
            while $RACE returns the actual monster race you are 
            playing, such as Lich or Dragon.
  $REALM1   Returns the name of the player's first realm, if any. For 
            example, Chaos or Sorcery. If the player does not have a 
            first realm, then this variable returns none.
  $REALM2   Returns the name of the player's second realm, if any. For 
            example, Life or Death. If the player does not have a 
            second realm, then this variable returns none.
  $LEVEL    Returns the player's current level. Typically, you combine 
            this with GEQ or LEQ to test the level against a threshold, 
            such as [LEQ $LEVEL 34].
  $MONEY    Returns the amount of gold the player has. Like $LEVEL, use 
            this with GEQ or LEQ to test whether your player is rich or 
            poor.
  
  As mentioned before, all variables begin with a $ character to 
  distinguish them from string literals. Also, note there are other 
  variables like $SYS and $KEYBOARD which I haven't documented.
  
Table X: Conditional Lines: Literals
  Literal   Explanation
  Number    Numbers are written like 105 or 32.
  String    Strings are written like High-Mage or Beholder. Note that 
            string literals are not quoted and therefore may not 
            contain spaces.
  

The Easy Destroyer

If, after reading all of the above, you decide that The Mogaminator is 
too much for you to handle, you may, instead, use a simpler system to 
manage objects: The Easy Destroyer. I don't recommend this, but the 
choice is yours. This system is configured via options (see [l]). The 
option destroy_items turns The Easy Destroyer on and off. If you are 
using The Mogaminator, be sure to turn off The Easy Destroyer, and vice 
versa. (BTW, you "turn off" The Mogaminator but closing the game and 
deleting the pickpref-NAME.prf file whose location was indicated in the 
reference section).
