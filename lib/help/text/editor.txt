The Mogaminator

The Mogaminator is a rules-based system for automatic object handling, 
which you can activate or modify with the _ command. With this system, 
you can decide which objects to pick up, which to destroy, which to 
automatically identify, and which to display as wanted in the object 
list. You can automatically inscribe objects to suit your tastes, and 
even enter conditional statements to handle the preferences of 
different races and classes. Or you can just keep the default 
Mogaminator rules, which already do all of the above!

This document describes this system in tutorial fashion, assuming you 
know nothing about it. Detailed reference material will appear towards 
the bottom of this document (see [a] if you really cannot wait!).

The system is named after its original author, Hengband developer 
Mogami.

Review of Object Knowledge
There is no doubt about it: the game generates lots and lots of 
objects. Some are valuable, some are not, and some are only valuable in 
specific situations... The Mogaminator will help you untangle that 
mountain of loot.

First, a really quick review of what is explained in detail at [b]. 
When you find an object, it will generally be unidentified, but you 
might have (or soon receive) a rough sense of the object's quality, 
called object feeling or pseudo-ID. If the object looks promising, you 
probably want to identify it to reveal the basics and maybe *Identify* 
it to reveal special properties.

So your knowledge of an object is in one of the following states:
  [1] Unsensed
  [2] Sensed (pseudo-identified)
  [3] Identified
  [4] *Identified*

For mushrooms, potions and scrolls, things are a little different; 
these objects come in flavors, and once you have learned the flavor, 
you will immediately recognize all future instances of that object. 
Indeed, all instances of the object are exactly alike, so the 
identification game is simply to discover and know the first instance 
of the object, and then decide, via your pick-up and destroy 
preferences, what to do with future instances of this type of object.

Managing Objects

There are three ways to manage objects: manually, by using the Easy 
Destroyer ([c] below), and by using the Mogaminator. The Mogaminator is 
much more powerful than the Easy Destroyer, which simply destroys 
items, usually junk. The Mogaminator and the Easy Destroyer should only 
be used side-by-side if you have turned the always_pickup option on.

What is the Mogaminator? Basically, it is a rules-based system for 
taking a given action each time you encounter a certain type of object. 
The default action is pick up, and this action is used whenever you 
fail to specify an alternative action; but the Mogaminator can also 
destroy junk for you and identify and inscribe objects automatically. 
Let's discuss the basics.

Basic Usage

The Mogaminator is activated by pressing _, which also brings up an 
in-game editor where you can manage your preferences. It might look 
like this:

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This line is a comment.                                                        
 
If you are new, you probably want to run from this complexity as fast 
as you can. Notice the top line of the screen where it tells you how to 
get out: ^Q (and you can also exit through the ESC menu). The desire to 
exit immediately is understandable, and in fact not a problem: simply 
pressing _ turned the Mogaminator on and initialized it with default 
preferences, so it should do a good job without any further messing. 
(If you are very lazy, you can stop reading here and just happily play 
away with the default preferences for the rest of the game!)

So What Happened?

With the Mogaminator now on, you will find much of the junk you 
encounter being destroyed. For example, all those corpses and skeletons 
you leave behind as you hack and slash your way through the dungeon... 
except for wanted corpses, which are getting automatically picked up!

That's a good start; but you might still run into objects you consider 
useless. For example, suppose you bought a lantern at the General 
Store; now you don't really care about torches anymore. Use the k 
command (or ^D for the Roguelike keyset) and you get a prompt like:
  Really destroy Wooden Torches {unidentified}? [y/n/Auto]

Notice the Auto option. Choose that, and you get a message that the 
object is destroyed, but the fact that you don't like torches is 
remembered by the system. The next time your character moves on top of 
one, it will be destroyed automatically.

That's one simple way to use the Mogaminator: keep registering stuff 
for automatic destruction as you encounter it, and the loot mountain 
becomes easier to manage; but as we'll see later, auto-pickup is even 
better than auto-destruction.

Oops, I'm Auto-Destroying Rings of Speed

Ouch! Well, don't panic. You can fix the problem easily; but doing so 
will require you to go back to the preference file editor. Press _ and 
then press END to move to the end of the document. This is where the 
game keeps track of any objects that you automatically registered for 
destruction. Your screen might look something like:
 
 (^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)       * (0,268)            
                                                                                
 ?:[EQU $CLASS Tourist]

 ?:1                                                                            
                                                                                
 ~special items                                                                 
 !worthless items                                                               
 #!unusable items                                                               
 ?:$AUTOREGISTER                                                                
 # *Warning!* The lines below will be deleted later.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Destroy all light sources whose name begins with "wooden torch$", and which ar 
 neither ego-item nor artifact. Do not display as wanted.  This line will be    
 deleted later.
 
You cannot tell from the picture above, but I placed the cursor on the 
very last line of the file; in my case, the line from when I registered 
torches for destruction. Notice that at the very bottom of the screen, 
the game tells you exactly what the given rule means; if you are 
curious, you can move the cursor around the default preference file and 
actually learn quite a bit about how the system works. If you wish to 
simply remove this (or any other) rule, just delete the corresponding 
line and then exit with ^W to save and apply your changes.

What About Stuff I Want?

What you don't want is only half the story; some objects you really 
like. The two work nicely together, since interesting objects will 
appear at the top of the ] object list. This allows you to easily track 
the interesting stuff even if the junk has not been destroyed!

Suppose you want potions of Cure Critical Wounds (this is a random but 
reasonable example of an item not set to be picked up by default). 
Wouldn't it be nice if these potions were automatically picked up, as 
well as displayed near the top of the object list? This is accomplished 
by adding the following line to the top of the preferences file:
 
 (^Q:Quit, ^W:Save&Quit, ESC:Menu, Other:Input text)       * (0,0)              
 cure critical wounds

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Pick up all items which have "cure critical wounds" as part of their name.
 Display these items as wanted in object list.
 
I colored the new line yellow in the screenshot to make it stand out. 
Pay attention to the bottom of the screen: does it sound like it will 
work? The reason I had to put the new line at the top is that rules are 
processed in order of priority from top to bottom; so if I placed the 
new rule at the bottom, it might have been overridden by an earlier 
rule.

Now, let's press ] to activate the Object List - is there anything on 
this level that I want?

There are 4 wanted objects:                                         LEVEL      1

Bingo! You can even automatically travel to those delicious potions by 
pressing J inside the Object List. What could be easier?

To recap, adding the line "cure critical wounds" tells the Mogaminator 
to pick up any object that has "cure critical wounds" as part of its 
name. You don't have to type so much - "crit" might work just as well - 
but the less you type, the more likely it is that your new rule will 
also match other objects. For example, "cure" would match potions of 
Cure Light Wounds, Cure Serious Wounds and Cure Critical Wounds, and 
even Staves of Cure Wounds. Sometimes this is OK, but at other times, 
it is better to type more.

Introduction to Rules and Events

So how does all this work? Basically, the preference file is an ordered 
list of rules. Whenever a certain event happens (such as moving on top 
of an object), the rules are scanned from top to bottom, and the first 
one that matches (if any) is applied. Every rule has an action 
associated with it that determines what to do if the rule applies.

Each rule is a single line in the file; but not every line is a rule. 
Some lines are blank, some are comments, and some are conditionals that 
tell the game when to ignore rules.

Objects are tested against rules whenever a specific event happens; 
generally when the player (1) moves on top of an object, (2) gets a new 
object feeling (see [d]) or (3) identifies an object (see [e]).

Rules

A rule is a single line that consists of an action to perform, a 
predicate to test matches, and an optional inscription to add. Let's 
discuss each of these in turn.

  Actions
  
  First of all, picking something up is the default action and is 
  inferred whenever you fail to specify an alternative. What are the 
  alternatives?
  
  !  Destroy
  ;  Prompt to pick up
  ~  Leave on the floor
  
  These are the primary actions. Pick-up is assumed if the rule does 
  not begin with !, ; or ~.
  
  In addition, there are the following action letters that augment the 
  primary action:
  
  (  Don't display this item on the M map
  ?  Automatically identify this item
  
  The first of these is not commonly used, since the M map item display 
  has been completely obsoleted by improvements to the object list. The 
  second option (?) is very useful, though, since it automatically 
  identifies the matching object. This is a great time-saver, but 
  requires you to carry Scrolls or Staves of Identify.
  
  All of the action letters must be specified first in the line for the 
  rule, with one exception. The # letter indicates that you wish to 
  automatically inscribe matching objects, and it must occur at the end 
  of the rule, followed only by the inscription text itself. For 
  example, #@ad!sdk at the end of a rule will automatically inscribe 
  @ad!sdk to any object matching the rule. (See [f] for an explanation 
  of this inscription!)
  
  Matching
  We saw above that matching is by string comparison with the object 
  name, but you can be more specific than that if you want. To do so, 
  use the following keywords to construct a predicate used to test 
  objects. The keyword portion of the match consists of zero or more 
  adjectives modifying a noun that indicates the broad class of objects 
  which should be considered. In addition, you can specify a free form 
  text comparison string by adjoining : followed by text to search for. 
  We'll put all of this together in the examples section below.
  
  Let's do nouns first. A complete list is presented at the end of this 
  document, but some common nouns to get us started include:
  
  Items     Applies to everything. This is useful for very general 
            rules, such as ~?unidentified items to automatically 
            identify, but leave on the ground, everything not yet 
            identified; or even items to pick everything up!
  Weapons   Applies to all melee weapons, but not to ranged weapons.
  Shooters  Applies to all missile weapons, including bows, slings and 
            crossbows.
  Armors    Applies to all forms of armor, including shields, helms and 
            cloaks as well as body armor.
  Wands     Applies to magical devices that are wands
  Staves    Applies to magical devices that are staves
  Rods      Applies to magical devices that are rods
  Potions   Applies to potions
  Scrolls   Applies to scrolls
  
  If you are using keywords to build a match predicate, then you must 
  specify exactly one noun, but may use as many adjectives as you like. 
  The complete list of adjectives is given below at [g], but here are 
  some of the more common ones:
  
  Unaware      Applies to objects whose flavor has not yet been 
               identified.
  Unidentified Applies to any objects that have not yet been 
               identified.
  Unsensed     Applies to objects that have not been identified or 
               pseudo-identified.
  Ego          Applies to all excellent objects.
  Nameless     Applies to all non-ego, non-artifact objects.
  Wanted       Applies to corpses and skeletons of wanted monsters. 
               These may be turned in at the Hunter's Office for a 
               prize.
  
  As an example of using multiple adjectives, the phrase ?unidentified 
  ego weapons applies to, well, all melee weapons that are both 
  excellent and not yet identified. Of course this means you must have 
  pseudo-identified the object to know that it is an ego.
  
  Finally, use a search string to further refine the match. If you 
  don't use any adjective or noun keywords, then the entire text of 
  your rule (starting after any action letters, and including all text 
  up to the # inscription character) is used as the search string. If 
  you are using keywords, mark the end of the keyword section with the 
  : separator. Examples are discussed below.
  
  Examples
  
  !potions:apple juice
    Destroy potions of apple juice (as refreshing as they might be!). 
    It uses the ! action letter for destruction, the potions keyword to 
    apply to an entire class of objects, the : separator key, and a 
    text field for string matching against the object name.
  
  ?unaware items
    Pick up and automatically identify unidentified flavored items 
    (e.g. a potion you've never seen before). Note that the pickup 
    action is implied since none of the other primary actions are 
    indicated, and even though there is a secondary action (to 
    auto-id). This command uses the adjective unaware to modify the 
    noun items. You could narrow down the applicability of this rule by 
    using a more specific noun, such as scrolls or potions.
  
  wanted corpses#Wanted!kkk
    Pick up wanted corpses, and automatically inscribe them with 
    Wanted!kkk. This inscription may make it sound like the monster was 
    wanted for racism, but it simply means you get prompted repeatedly 
    if you accidentally try to destroy the corpse. (See [h] for more on 
    how inscriptions work.)
  
  ?staves:destruction#@ud!sdk
    Pick up and automatically identify all staves whose name contains 
    the string "destruction". Inscribe these objects with @ud!sdk.
  

Example Scenarios

After that last section, you should have complete mastery over 
individual rules. Now, it is time to step up one level and apply 
multiple rules to accomplish common tasks. Ready?

  In this scenario, you would like to handle the stream of objects in 
  the most efficient way possible. Let's begin with the following 
  rules:
    unsensed armors
    unsensed weapons
  
  These rules say to pick up all armor and weapons not yet sensed or 
  identified. That leaves out many types of objects, like potions and 
  scrolls, but at least weapons and armors are objects that can be 
  sensed. Since objects need to be in your pack to be sensed (we know 
  immediate floor-pseudo-ID didn't kick in because the objects matched 
  the unsensed adjective!), it is convenient to pick them up.
  
  Now, let's add the following rules:
    !average common weapons
    !average common armors
  
  You might not actually want this; but for now, assume your character 
  is advanced enough to view average common equipment as junk. These 
  rules will fire once pseudo-ID kicks in, destroying weapons and armor 
  that pseudo-ID as average. The common adjective prevents these rules 
  from applying to rare average items, like dragon scale mail or blades 
  of chaos.
  
  So, now our character is merrily picking up all equipment and then 
  auto-destroying the average stuff once pseudo-id kicks in. Can we do 
  more? Well, try adding:
    ?unidentified ego items
  
  Now, the egos are automatically being identified on pseudo-ID as 
  well. Pretty sweet! But maybe you get tired of some ego types after a 
  while, and want them registered for destruction:
  
    !common ego cloaks:of protection
    !common ego weapons:of sharpness
  
  Now even boring excellent items are being toasted for you, 
  automatically, with nary a keystroke on your part; but, sometimes 
  swords of sharpness become dice-boosted, and might not be so boring 
  after all. You can protect them with
    dice boosted weapons
  or perhaps even
    weapons more dice than 30
  though that last one is an advanced maneuver.
  
  In summary, the complete order of your rules might be:
    weapons more dice than 30
    ?unidentified ego items
  
    !average common weapons
    !average common armors
  
    unidentified armors
    unidentified weapons
  
    !common ego cloaks:of protection
    !common ego weapons:of sharpness
  
  New armors and weapons come down and hit rule 5 or 6 when your 
  character steps on them, so they get placed into your pack 
  automatically. Eventually pseudo-ID will kick in, revealing the 
  object as average, in which case it is destroyed by rule 3 or rule 4, 
  or as excellent, in which case it is processed by rule 2 which 
  auto-identifies the ego item and rescans the rules. If it is a cloak 
  of protection, it is destroyed by rule 7, while if it is a weapon of 
  sharpness, it is destroyed by rule 8 - unless it happened to be 
  hugely dice boosted, in which case it is protected by top-priority 
  rule 1. Easy, right? Now you only have {bad} and {good} and {special} 
  equipment to worry about...
  
  Scenario #2: Flavored Objects
  This one is easier, and I'll give the full set of rules first:
    potions:healing#!kq
    potions:of strength#!k
    potions:of intelligence#!k
    potions:of wisdom#!k
    potions:of dexterity#!k
    potions:of constitution#!k
    potions:of charisma#!k
    potions:augmentation#!k
  
    scrolls:artifact creation#!*
    ...
  
    ?unaware items
  
    collecting potions
    collecting scrolls
  
    ?:$AUTOREGISTER
    ...
    (!potions:^potion of restore charisma$
    (!scrolls:^scroll of treasure detection$
    ... <many more junk flavors auto-registered for destruction> ...
  
  Now, the pattern is wanted flavors on top for autopickup (and 
  inscription), unwanted flavors on bottom for autodestruction (these 
  are placed in your file automatically each time you press A while 
  destroying an object) and rules for collecting and unaware items in 
  the middle. Unaware items get automatically identified, at which 
  point one of the pick-up or destroy rules might get a chance to act. 
  As for the collecting rules, those fire if you have another object of 
  the same flavor in your pack. Perhaps you are carrying potions of 
  Cure Critical Wounds, but don't have a rule specifically for this 
  flavor; in this case, the collecting rule will pick up other potions 
  of Cure Critical Wounds for you.
  
  Scenario #3: Spellbooks
  OK, this is the last one. See if you can figure this one out first:
    first realm's fourth spellbooks#@md!sdk
    first realm's third spellbooks#@mc!sdk
    ~first realm's second spellbooks#@mb!k
    ~first realm's first spellbooks#@ma!k
    second realm's fourth spellbooks#@mh!sdk
    second realm's third spellbooks#@mg!sdk
    ~second realm's second spellbooks#@mf!k
    ~second realm's first spellbooks#@me!k
    !first spellbooks
    !second spellbooks
    !third spellbooks:major arcana
    !fourth spellbooks:manual of mastery
    third spellbooks
    fourth spellbooks
  Did you figure it out? This scenario picks up high level spellbooks 
  from your character's magic realms, leaves low level spellbooks from 
  your realms, destroys all other low level spellbooks, destroys all 
  arcane magic spellbooks, but picks up high level spellbooks from 
  other realms (presumably to sell for gold). Spellbooks from your 
  realms are auto-inscribed to keep book labels consistent. Here, as 
  elsewhere, order is very important: rules for the character's spell 
  realms must come before the general rules to destroy low level 
  spellbooks. (There is an unreadable adjective that would have made 
  processing safer and less order-dependent here.)
  
Which Rule is Being Used?

If you are ever unsure about which rule is being applied in a given 
situation, turn on the destroy_debug option (see [i]). With this option 
you can use the Inspect command for more information. For example:

  a Thieves' Guide [Burglar's Handbook]

    Autopick: (!unreadable first spellbooks

I may or may not like this behavior, and if I don't, now I know which 
line to change!

In addition, with debugging turned on, the rules used are printed in 
the message log as actions are taken, so you can see exactly why 
objects are being destroyed, picked up, left on the ground or 
auto-identified. For example:

  You have 26 charges remaining. (AutoID:~?unidentified rods) You see a 
  Rod: Frost Ball (1/3 charges). (Destroy:(!rods:frost ball$)
  Auto-destroying.

Since this is message spam, you probably don't want to leave the 
destroy_debug option permanently on.

Conditionals

This is an advanced topic, but the underlying principles are simple. 
What you consider useful or junk may depend on your race, class, 
character level or other similar details; and conditionals help you 
apply rules only when they are appropriate. Each conditional statement 
evaluates as either TRUE (1) or FALSE (0); if a conditional that 
evaluates as FALSE is encountered, all rules that follow it are ignored 
until the next TRUE conditional is reached.

Conditional lines always begin with the characters ?:, followed by a 
(rather cryptic looking) expression that the game will evaluate.

Let's look at an example. Remember Scenario #1 above when we added 
lines to destroy average equipment? I said you might not actually want 
them, unless your character was advanced enough. Suppose you consider 
level 20 advanced enough?
  ?:[GEQ $LEVEL 20]
  !average common weapons
  !average common armors
  ?:1

Notice there are two lines colored in violet, each beginning with ?:. 
These are the conditionals; the first includes a funny-looking 
expression while the second one is much simpler, just ?:1.

The first conditional might or might not evaluate as TRUE; it depends 
on the value of $LEVEL (which you probably guessed is your current 
character level) and whether or not it is >= 20. GEQ stands for greater 
than or equal to, and 20 is just a number. The order ([GEQ $LEVEL 20] 
instead of, say, $LEVEL GEQ 20 or even $LEVEL >= 20) is because GEQ is 
this expression's function, and $LEVEL and 20 are arguments for it.

In contrast, ?:1 is easy. It evaluates as... well, 1! And as we already 
noted, 1 means TRUE; so ?:1 flips the "ignore rules" switch back off, 
and effectively marks the end of the area to which the previous 
conditional applies.

Here's another example:
  ?:[OR [EQU $CLASS Mage High-Mage Sorcerer] [EQU $RACE Beholder Lich] ]
  wizardstaff
  ?:1

That's a more complicated expression, but you can probably figure it 
out: it's TRUE if your class is either a Mage, High-Mage or a Sorcerer; 
or if your race is either a Beholder or a Lich.

So, we have expressions composed of functions (like GEQ and OR), 
variables (like $RACE and $LEVEL), literals (like Mage and Sorcerer) 
and brackets. What are the functions and variables we can use?

Function    Explanation
  IOR       Inclusive Or: [IOR a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of any 
            subexpression a, b, c, ... is TRUE.
  OR        Same as IOR. (If you are a programmer or a mathematician 
            you might expect there to be a XOR function, but there 
            isn't!)
  AND       Logical And: [AND a b c ...] is TRUE if the values of all 
            subexpressions a, b, c, ... are TRUE.
  NOT       [NOT a] is TRUE if a is FALSE, and vice versa. Use this 
            when you want to take an action when something is not true.
  EQU       [EQU v a b c ...] is TRUE when the value of v is one of the 
            values a, b, c, ... Comparison is by string. Typically, you 
            use this with v being a built-in variable expression like 
            $CLASS (see below), and the remaining arguments being 
            strings to test like Mage or Sorcerer. Note that string 
            literals are not quoted and therefore may not contain 
            spaces. Hyphenate names with spaces (Filthy-Rag instead of 
            Filthy Rag) if necessary.
  LEQ       [LEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is less than 
            or equal to the integer value of a. Note that while EQU 
            treats its arguments as strings, LEQ treats them as 
            numbers.
  GEQ       [GEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is greater 
            than or equal to the integer value of a. Note that while 
            EQU treats its arguments as strings, GEQ treats them as 
            numbers.

Variable    Explanation
$RACE       Returns the name of your race; for example, Snotling or 
            High-Elf.
$CLASS      Returns the name of your class; for example, Warrior-Mage 
            or Mindcrafter. Note that if you are playing in Monster 
            mode, then this variable always returns Monster, while 
            $RACE returns the actual monster race you are playing, such 
            as Lich or Dragon.
$SUBCLASS   Returns the name of your subclass, if any. This could be, 
            say, Yeqrezh on a Disciple or Evil Bias on a Gray-Mage.
$SPECIALITY Returns the name of your speciality, for example Axes on a 
            Weaponmaster or Potions on a Devicemaster. Returns none for 
            all classes except those two.
$REALM1     Returns the name of your first realm, if any; for example, 
            Chaos or Sorcery. If the player does not have a first 
            realm, then this variable returns none.
$REALM2     Returns the name of your second realm, if any; for example, 
            Life or Death. If the player does not have a second realm, 
            then this variable returns none.
$LEVEL      Returns your current level. Typically, you combine this 
            with GEQ or LEQ to test the level against a threshold, such 
            as [LEQ $LEVEL 34].
$SELLING    Returns Off if you have turned the no_selling option on, 
            and On otherwise.
$MONEY      Returns the amount of gold the player has. Like $LEVEL, use 
            this with GEQ or LEQ to test whether your player is rich or 
            poor.

All variables begin with a $ character to distinguish them from string 
literals.

Literal     Explanation
Number      Numbers are written like 105 or 32.
String      Strings are written like High-Mage or Beholder, and may not 
            contain spaces.

Using the Editor

The editor should not be too hard to use, and you can probably figure 
things out on your own. Like any text editor, you move the cursor about 
with the arrow keys and then type when you have located the correct 
position. Advanced things (and easy things that slip your mind) can be 
done through the ESC menu:
 
 (a-j) Command:

 This line is a comment.                                                        
 
Here, you can clearly see what commands to use to move the cursor 
about, as well as backup keys in case normal keys like arrows somehow 
fail.

Note that the editor automatically colors each rule line according to 
the syntax of the expression. Sometimes the text displayed is not 
exactly the same as the rule you actually typed in (adjectives might be 
shuffled, for instance); but the meaning will be the same. To avoid 
confusion, the line your cursor is on is never syntax-colored and 
always displays exactly what you typed.

The Easy Destroyer

If, after reading all of the above, you decide that the Mogaminator is 
too much for you to handle, you may instead use a simpler system to 
manage objects: the Easy Destroyer. This system is configured via 
options (see [j]); the option destroy_items turns the Easy Destroyer on 
and off. Using the Mogaminator and the Easy Destroyer side-by-side is 
recommended if and only if you have the always_pickup option on.

If you have turned on the Mogaminator but don't like what it's doing, 
you can use the no_mogaminator option to turn it off, or the 
leave_mogaminator option to limit object destruction to complete junk 
only. Using always_pickup also disables item destruction by the 
Mogaminator while still allowing the Easy Destroyer.

Reference Tables

This section will give all the nitty-gritty syntax details for the 
Mogaminator. But first, where are those preference files located 
anyway? The default preferences are initialized from 
lib/pref/pickpref.prf; so if you want to edit the default preferences 
for all characters, this is the file to edit. Once you activate the 
Mogaminator, your preferences are stored in a separate file in a 
system-dependent location. On Windows, they will be stored at 
lib/user/pickpref-NAME.prf, while on Linux they might be moved to 
~/.angband/FrogComposband/pickpref-NAME.prf (outside the game's 
directory structure). Here, NAME is replaced with your player's current 
name. So if you want to edit your character's preferences using an 
outside text editor, this is the file you need to change. It's usually 
simpler to just use the in-game editor; but if you do edit preferences 
outside the game while you are playing, be sure to use the $ command to 
force the game to reload the preference file.

The promised reference tables follow below... enjoy!

Table I: Line Types in the Editor
  Type        Explanation
  Comment     These lines begin with a # and are ignored by the system.
  
  Conditional These lines flip the global processing switch ON and OFF. 
              If the expression evaluates to TRUE, then the switch is 
              turned ON and any subsequent rules will be included. If 
              the expression evaluates to FALSE, the switch is turned 
              OFF and any subsequent rules will be ignored until the 
              next TRUE conditional is reached. See [k] above for 
              details.
  
  Rule        Every other line, unless it is blank, is a rule. The 
              syntax of a rule is described in the following 5 tables.
  
Table II: Rules: Syntax
  Rules have one of the following two syntactic forms:
  [Actions] Adjectives* Noun Special-Clauses* [:Search-String] 
    [#Inscription-String]
  
  [Actions] Search-String [#Inscription-String]
  
  Square brackets denote optional syntactic elements. * is the 
  Kleene-Star and indicates that 0 or more of the preceding syntactic 
  elements may be specified. All rules must be specified on a single 
  line in your preference file.
  
  Syntactic Element  Explanation
  Actions            The "what to do if this rule matches" part. Uses 
                     one or more of the action letters described in the 
                     next table. If this element is omitted, the action 
                     defaults to pick up.
  
  Adjectives         These modify nouns, further narrowing down the set 
                     of objects that will match the rule.
  
  Noun               A single noun is always specified for the first 
                     syntactic form and indicates the broad class of 
                     objects to which this rule shall apply.
  
  Special Clauses    Further refinements, discussed below ([l]). They 
                     resemble adjectives in that they modify nouns, but 
                     unlike adjectives they involve numerical 
                     comparison of object attributes. They also always 
                     follow the noun, while adjectives precede the 
                     noun.
  
  Search String      This is a free-form text value to compare against 
                     the object's name. Comparison is by string and is 
                     case-insensitive. Two special characters, ^ and $, 
                     indicate the matching string must be at the 
                     beginning or end (respectively) of the object's 
                     name; for example, ^foo will only match objects 
                     whose names begin with foo, so foobar matches it 
                     but barfoo does not. Similarly, bar$ only matches 
                     objects whose name ends with bar. Finally, note 
                     that object names are always in the singular; so, 
                     for example, Seeker Bolt would work for a string 
                     match, but Seeker Bolts would always fail.
  
  Inscription String This is a free-form text value that will be 
                     automatically inscribed on any object matching 
                     this rule.
  
  If this seems complicated, study the default preferences and you will 
  soon figure things out.
  
Table III: Rules: Action Letters
  Letter  Type       Explanation
    !     Primary    Destroy
    ;     Primary    Prompt to pick up
    ~     Primary    Leave on the floor
          Primary    Pick up - assumed if you fail to provide an 
                     alternative primary action letter. There is no 
                     specific action letter for this action, it is 
                     simply assumed unless overridden.
    (     Secondary  Hide in M map
    ?     Secondary  Automatically identify this item, provided you 
                     have scrolls or staves of Identify.
    #     Terminal   Auto-inscribe matching objects with whatever text 
                     follows this key. Note that Primary and Secondary 
                     action letters must be placed at the beginning of 
                     a rule line, while Terminal action letters must be 
                     placed at the end of a rule line.
  
  Every rule must have one Primary action (which is assumed to be Pick 
  Up if nothing else is specified). It can have 0 or more secondary 
  actions, and the sole Terminal action is also optional.
  
Table IV: Rules: Nouns
  Noun       Explanation
  Items      Applies to everything. This is useful for very general 
             rules, such as ~?unidentified items to automatically 
             identify, but leave on the ground, everything not yet 
             identified; or even items to pick everything up! The noun 
             items is implicitly assumed if no other noun is specified.
  
  Weapons    Applies to all melee weapons (including diggers), but not 
             to missile weapons.
  
  Favorite Weapons
             Applies to all weapons, including shooters, that your 
             class likes. For example, Weaponmasters specialize in a 
             given type of weapons, such as Axes or Crossbows; whatever 
             their speciality is, this "noun" will apply to these 
             preferred items. Note that the game considers favorite 
             weapons a noun, not an adjective followed by a noun.
  
  Hafted Weapons
             Applies to all hafted weapons like Maces, Flails and War 
             Hammers; these weapons are preferred by Priests. Like the 
             Favorite Weapons "noun" above, the Mogaminator views this 
             as a single noun, not an adjective followed by a noun.
  
  Diggers    Applies to all digging implements, such as shovels, 
             mattocks and picks.
  
  Shooters   Applies to anything that goes in the shooter shot, 
             including slings, bows, crossbows, harps and guns.
  
  Ammo       Applies to all ammunition for missile weapons: arrows, 
             pebbles, shots and bolts.
  
  Armors     Applies to all forms of armor (for more specific nouns, 
             see below):
  Suits      Applies to body armor.
  Shields    Applies to shields.
  Cloaks     Applies to cloaks.
  Helms      Applies to helmets and crowns.
  Gloves     Applies to gloves.
  Boots      Applies to boots.
  
  Wands      Applies to wands.
  
  Staves     Applies to staves (the magical device kind, not the 
             quarterstaff kind!). For example, try staves:healing or 
             staves:speed.
  
  Rods       Applies to rods.
  
  Potions    Applies to potions. (Watch out - many potion names, like 
             Potion of Strength and Potion of Restore Strength, 
             partially match each other.)
  
  Scrolls    Applies to scrolls.
  
  Rings      Applies to rings.
  
  Amulets    Applies to amulets.
  
  Lights     Applies to anything that goes in the light source slot.
  
  Spellbooks Applies to all spellbooks. If you are a non-caster (and 
             non-seller) you can specify !spellbooks with impunity, but 
             as a book caster you probably want to combine this with 
             adjectives.
  
  Junk       Applies to complete junk like broken sticks. Also covers 
             statues (which are potentially sellable); use !worthless 
             junk to exclude them.
  
  Corpses    Applies to corpses, which are potentially useful; 
             Possessors can possess them, Igors cut them apart, some 
             demons eat humanoid corpses, and wanted corpses can be 
             turned in at the Bounty Office.
  
  Skeletons  Like corpses, you may turn in wanted skeletons at the 
             Bounty Office. Archers may also use skeletons to make 
             arrows and bolts.
  
  If you are using keywords to build a match predicate, then you must 
  specify exactly one noun, but may use as many adjectives as you like.
  
Table V: Rules: Adjectives
  Because there are so many adjectives, they are grouped here by kind.

Object Knowledge
Unsensed     Applies to objects that have not yet been identified or 
             pseudo-identified.

Unidentified Applies to objects that have not yet been identified (e.g. 
             ?unidentified items to auto-identify everything).

Unaware      Applies to objects whose flavor has not yet been 
             identified.

Identified   Applies all objects that have been identified.

*Identified* Applies to fully identified objects, and is rarely needed.

Object Quality
Average      Applies to all average items. Some players like to combine 
             this with the ! action letter quite early; but that can be 
             inconvenient if you are looking for a reforge base item.

Good         Applies to all good items.

Ego          Applies to all excellent objects. See [m] for more 
             information.

Artifact     Applies to all artifacts. See [n] for more information.

Cursed       Applies to all cursed items. Use sparingly; cursed items 
             can be good, and !worthless items catches the real junk.

Nameless     Applies to all objects that are neither artifacts nor ego 
             items.

Rare         Applies to all objects in a specific, hardcoded list of 
             object types; for example, Blades of Chaos and Maces of 
             Disruption are rare, as are all dragon armor pieces 
             including dragon scale mail.

Common       Applies to all objects that are not rare; so a Long Sword 
             is common, but a Blade of Chaos is not.

Worthless    Any object whose value is 0 is considered worthless. Watch 
             out a bit, though: for example, corpses are "worthless", 
             but you still want to keep some of them. The default 
             preferences have !worthless items at the very bottom, 
             below rules that protect useful worthless things.

Icky         Icky items are items unsuitable for your class; they may 
             be an Icky Wield or cause other class-specific penalties.

Object Attributes
Dice Boosted When used with weapons or shooters, this adjective 
             indicates that the object's damage dice or damage 
             multiplier are higher than usual for the object kind.

See the Special Clauses below for more information about matching on an 
object's attributes.

Spellbook Adjectives
Unreadable     This will match spellbooks that you cannot use, either 
               because you are playing a class that does not have 
               realms or because the book does not belong to a realm 
               you selected.

First Realm's  Applies to books from your primary magic realm, if any.

Second Realm's Applies to books from your secondary magic realm, if 
               any.

First
Second
Third
Fourth         Each realm of magic has four spellbooks; these 
               adjectives refer to each of these books by number. 
               Usually, the first and second books are cheap, while the 
               third and fourth are valuable.

Corpse Adjectives
Wanted       Combine with corpses or skeletons to indicate the remains 
             of a wanted monster.

Unique       Combine with corpses or skeletons to indicate the remains 
             of a unique monster. (Maybe you're a collector?)

Human        Some characters use humanoid corpses either as food, or as 
             part of a ritual to summon a powerful demonic ally. For 
             these situations, add a rule like ~human corpses to your 
             preferences, though ~special items will also work.

Miscellaneous
Collecting   Collecting items matches stackable objects identical with 
             objects already in your pack.

Special      Special items are objects your race or class needs; 
             objects that are usually considered junk by default. For 
             example, some characters receive scant sustenance from 
             normal food and must consume humanoid corpses (yum!). 
             Daemon casters use corpses for various spells. Archers use 
             skeletons to make their own ammo. Beastmasters and Cavalry 
             actually enjoy wands of Haste Monster. Such special 
             scenarios are handled with this adjective. Note that this 
             is a meaning completely distinct from the object feeling 
             {special}, which refers to artifacts.

Unusable     Applies to wearable items you currently have no equipment 
             slots for. Especially handy in Monster Mode - still, use 
             with some care in case you acquire new slots over time...

Table VI: Rules: Special Clauses
  In the following clauses, N refers to a digit (0-9); the sequence NN 
  means you may type one or two digits, and can therefore enter any 
  number between 0 and 99. Analogously, NNNNNN allows numbers between 0 
  and 999999. If you enter too many digits, the parser will not 
  recognize your special clause, and you will get unsatisfactory 
  results from your rule.
  
  Special Clause          Explanation
  More Dice Than NN       This clause applies to weapons only, and is 
                          true whenever the maximum possible damage 
                          exceeds the number you enter. For example a 
                          (2d5) weapon will match more dice than 9 but 
                          will fail to match more dice than 10.
  
  More Bonus Than NN      An object's bonus is here the largest of its 
                          pval, to-hit, to-dam and to-AC. For example, 
                          rings more bonus than 9:speed will pick up 
                          rings of speed (+10) or better, but will not 
                          match other rings of speed; and suits more 
                          bonus than 19:power dragon says that you 
                          would quite like a Power Dragon Scale Mail, 
                          but only if its to-AC bonus is +20 or better!
  
  More Level Than NN      This clause is intended to be used on corpses 
                          so that Possessors can manage the mountains 
                          of dead bodies they create. You can also use 
                          it with other objects, in which case it 
                          corresponds to the level of the object, or 
                          its ego type. For devices, it matches the 
                          power level of the device.
  
  More Charges Than NN    Intended for magical devices; maybe you 
                          already have a Staff of Cure Wounds with 20 
                          charges and consider anything smaller than 
                          that to be junk.
  
  More Weight Than NN     Some classes have weight restrictions on 
                          armor, like Monks, Scouts and Ninjas. Other 
                          classes, like Maulers, prefer very heavy 
                          weapons. This clause matches against the 
                          weight of the object, in pounds; so weapons 
                          more weight than 39 will match weapons 
                          weighing at least 39.1 lbs.
  
  More Value Than NNNNNN  This clause matches against the known value 
                          of the object. Use with care, since unknown 
                          or even un-*identified* objects may have 
                          "known" values lower than the actual value.
  
Table VII: Conditionals: Syntax
  Conditional statements have the following syntactic form:
  
  ?:Expression
  
  Conditional expressions use the following (partial) grammar:
  
  Expression := Literal | Variable | [Function Expression*]
  Function   := IOR | OR | AND | NOT | EQU | LEQ | GEQ
  Variable   := $RACE | $CLASS | $REALM1 | $LEVEL | $MONEY | ...
  Literal    := 23 | 52 | Rage-Mage | High-Elf | ... 
  
  Note that unlike above, square brackets are part of the syntax of 
  expressions and do not indicate optional elements in the grammar. 
  Rather, function application expressions are always surrounded with 
  square brackets.
  
  When the expression on a conditional line evaluates to FALSE or 0, 
  then any subsequent rules will be ignored. When the expression 
  evaluates to TRUE or non-zero, then any subsequent rules will be 
  applied. See [o] above for details.
  
Table VIII: Conditionals: Functions
  Function    Explanation
    IOR       Inclusive Or: [IOR a b c ...] is TRUE if the value of any 
              subexpression a, b, c, ... is TRUE.
    OR        Same as IOR.
    AND       Logical And: [AND a b c ...] is TRUE if the values of all 
              subexpressions a, b, c, ... are TRUE.
    NOT       [NOT a] is TRUE if a is FALSE, and vice versa. Use this 
              when you want to take an action when something is not 
              true.
    EQU       [EQU v a b c ...] is TRUE when the value of v is one of 
              the values a, b, c, ... Comparison is by string. 
              Typically, you use this with v being a built-in variable 
              expression like $CLASS (see below), and the remaining 
              arguments being strings to test like Mage or Sorcerer. 
              Note that string literals are not quoted and therefore 
              may not contain spaces.
    LEQ       [LEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is less 
              than or equal to the integer value of a. Note that while 
              EQU treats its arguments as strings, LEQ treats them as 
              numbers.
    GEQ       [GEQ v a] is TRUE when the integer value of v is greater 
              than or equal to the integer value of a. Note that while 
              EQU treats its arguments as strings, GEQ treats them as 
              numbers.
  
Table IX: Conditionals: Variables
  Variable    Explanation
  $RACE       Returns the name of your race; for example, Snotling or 
              High-Elf.
  $CLASS      Returns the name of your class; for example, Warrior-Mage 
              or Mindcrafter. Note that if you are playing in Monster 
              mode, then this variable always returns Monster, while 
              $RACE returns the actual monster race you are playing, 
              such as Lich or Dragon.
  $SUBCLASS   Returns the name of your subclass, if any. This could be, 
              say, Yeqrezh on a Disciple or Evil Bias on a Gray-Mage.
  $SPECIALITY Returns the name of your speciality, for example Axes on 
              a Weaponmaster or Potions on a Devicemaster. Returns none 
              for all classes except those two.
  $REALM1     Returns the name of your first realm, if any; for 
              example, Chaos or Sorcery. If the player does not have a 
              first realm, then this variable returns none.
  $REALM2     Returns the name of your second realm, if any; for 
              example, Life or Death. If the player does not have a 
              second realm, then this variable returns none.
  $LEVEL      Returns your current level. Typically, you combine this 
              with GEQ or LEQ to test the level against a threshold, 
              such as [LEQ $LEVEL 34].
  $SELLING    Returns Off if you have turned the no_selling option on, 
              and On otherwise.
  $MONEY      Returns the amount of gold the player has. Like $LEVEL, 
              use this with GEQ or LEQ to test whether your player is 
              rich or poor.
  
  All variables begin with a $ character to distinguish them from 
  string literals. Note that some variables allowed by edit files are 
  not allowed here, and some variables that are allowed here (like $SYS 
  and $KEYBOARD) are unlikely to apply and so not documented.
  
Table X: Conditionals: Literals
  Literal     Explanation
  Number      Numbers are written like 105 or 32.
  String      Strings are written like High-Mage or Beholder. Note that 
              string literals are not quoted and therefore may not 
              contain spaces; hyphenate if necessary (Filthy-Rag for 
              the Filthy Rag race).
