Rune Knights

A large part of playing the Rune Knight involves the attachment of 
mystical runes of power to various objects in your equipment. Each type 
of rune grants abilities consistent with the rune's source, but the 
actual abilities granted will vary depending on the type of object to 
which it is affixed. For example, runes are generally more powerful 
when attached to your body armor then when attached to helmets, gloves 
or shields. Since attaching runes generally consumes all of your mana, 
and since the rune knight does not regenerate mana normally, you may 
find a process of experimentation to learn the various combinations 
frustrating. In this case, continue reading this helpfile. It is a bit 
of a spoiler, so you may decide to stop reading now. Personally, I 
would play with this information handy, but the choice is yours.
