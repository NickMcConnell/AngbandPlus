Rune-Knights

A large part of playing as a Rune-Knight involves the attachment of 
mystical runes of power to various pieces of equipment. Each type of 
rune grants some special thematic abilities; these abilities will vary 
slightly depending on the type of object to which the rune is affixed. 
Generally, runes are more powerful when attached to body armor than 
when attached to helmets, gloves or shields. Since attaching a rune 
generally consumes all of your mana and rune-knights do not regenerate 
mana normally, trying to figure things out by trial and error would be 
time-consuming and lead to suboptimal rune placement. Note that you can 
only attach a single rune to any given object, and cannot remove or 
change that rune once it has been added, although nothing prevents you 
from adding the same rune to multiple objects.

The rune cheat-sheet below is a bit of a spoiler, but most players are 
happy to play with this information handy.
