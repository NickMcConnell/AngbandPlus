Orcs

Orcs are Morgoth's creation and the backbone of his armies. They are 
accustomed to caves and tunnels, and resist darkness but tend to be 
vulnerable to light. Orcs are ugly, brutish pillagers by reputation and 
should not expect much love from shopkeepers. Morgoth's spirit lives in 
orcs and drives them forward, making them hard to frighten. What orcs 
lack in stealth and subtlety they make up for with their sheer brute 
strength, and generally have little trouble brushing aside weak enemies 
like kobolds; yet in the deep dungeons, where the strongest fighters 
and most powerful magicians reside, orcs are rarely seen.

Orc fighter
The most common and familiar type of orc, fighter orcs are feared 
around the world for their strength, endurance, brutality and low 
cunning. They start their careers as a lowly Snaga, but will eventually 
develop into Uruk-hai or even mighty warlords, capable of summoning and 
controlling armies of lesser orcs.

Orc shaman
Orc shamans and warlocks are more cunning than the average orc and have 
learned rudimentary magic from their black masters. They can detect 
threats, blink out of dangerous situations and easily dispatch weak 
enemies with their offensive spells, and are not quite as hopeless with 
magic devices as their fighter kin, but like all orcs they tend to have 
trouble when the going really gets tough.
