Shopping

Press [a] for the Quick Reference.

Each town on the surface contains numerous shops where you may purchase 
supplies or sell unwanted objects. Each shop specializes in a certain 
class of items: The Weapon Smiths sells weapons (melee and missile) 
while the Armory sells armor; the Alchemist sells potions and scrolls 
while the General Store sells basic utilities such as food, lanterns 
and oil. Each town also has a Black Market where you may, for an 
exorbitant price, purchase items normally found only in the dungeon.

Your First Shopping Spree

When you enter a shop, you will see a screen describing the shop's 
owner and the items available for purchase:
