Shopping

Press [a] for the Quick Reference and [b] for details on shopping.

Each town on the surface contains numerous shops where you may purchase 
supplies or sell unwanted objects. Each shop specializes in a certain 
class of items: The Weapon Smiths sells weapons (melee and missile) 
while the Armory sells armor; the Alchemist sells potions and scrolls 
while the General Store sells basic utilities such as food, lanterns 
and oil. Each town also has a Black Market where you may, for an 
exorbitant price, purchase items normally found only in the dungeon.

Your First Shopping Spree

When you enter a shop, you will see a screen describing the shop's 
owner and the items available for purchase:

A quick list of available commands is displayed on the bottom of the 
screen. Simply choose the appropriate command and follow the 
instructions. Use Page Up and Page Down if the shop inventory extends 
to multiple pages.

Every store owner has access to limited funds, and will only pay so 
much for items that you sell; this amount is listed next to the store 
type on the top of the display.
