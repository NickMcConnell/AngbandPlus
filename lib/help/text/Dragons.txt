Dragons

Dragons are powerful winged serpents. They are strong in combat, with 
razor-sharp claws and a bone-crushing bite; but even more legendary is 
their breath, which grows ever more deadly as the dragon matures.
 
Due to their non-humanoid bodies, dragons are unable to wear armor, 
gloves or boots; however, being creatures of magic, they may equip up 
to six rings. They can also wear a helmet, a light source, a cloak and 
an amulet. Because of these equipment restrictions, dragons may have a 
difficult time covering all resistances; but each dragon has at least 
one innate resistance, maybe even an immunity.
 
Dragons begin life in a weak form, being very young. As their bodies 
mature, their scales grow tough and their claws sharp. Their breaths 
become stronger and stronger, and they frequently gain additional 
magical powers and resistances. All dragons can fly, but younger 
dragons are not so quick as their elders.
 
With the exception of Steel Dragons, who are far less intelligent than 
their kin and rely on brute force only, each dragon may choose to 
specialize in a specific type of magic. These special dragon-magic 
realms do not require books to learn. The selection of a realm has a 
direct influence on the stats and skills of the dragon.

Red Dragon
Red Dragons are elemental dragons of fire, and the second-strongest 
fighters among dragons. Their fiery breaths are the stuff of legends 
with damage unsurpassed. Even their bites are likely to burn their 
opponents, further enhancing their deadliness in melee. As the Red 
Dragon matures, it becomes more and more resistant to fire, eventually 
gaining total immunity.

White Dragon
White Dragons are to cold what Red Dragons are to fire. Their melee is 
awe-inspiring, and their icy breath can be felt even in their bite. 
Together with Red Dragons, they have the deadliest breaths among 
dragonkind; and they become more and more resistant to cold as they 
mature, eventually attaining immunity.

Blue Dragon
Blue Dragons are elemental dragons of lightning. Their breaths are as 
strong as those of their Red and White brethren, their melee somewhat 
weaker but still mighty, and their bites eventually shock their foes. 
Blue Dragons become more and more resistant to lightning as they 
mature, eventually gaining total immunity.

Black Dragon
Black Dragons are to acid what Blue Dragons are to lightning. Their 
breaths are as strong as those of their Red, White and Blue kin; and 
fewer monsters resist acid, giving them an extra opening. As the Black 
Dragon matures, its bites become corrosive, and it grows more resistant 
to acid until it reaches immunity.

Green Dragon
Green Dragons are elemental dragons of venom. They are not quite as 
strong as Red or White dragons, but are still fearsome opponents. As 
they mature, their bites poison their enemies. Green Dragons become 
more and more resistant to poison over time, eventually achieving 
immunity.

Shadow Drake
Shadow Drakes are among the stealthiest of dragons. They are creatures 
of nether, and eventually evolve into Death Drakes and Spectral Wyrms. 
Their melee is the weakest among dragonkind and their breaths are also 
somewhat lacking, but they still make fearsome opponents. As they 
advance, these dragons gain the ability to pass through walls, and 
acquire several resistances including immunity to nether.

Law Drake
Law Drakes are powerful dragons of order. They can breathe sound or 
shards and eventually evolve into Great Wyrms of Law, though not as 
quickly as you might hope. Their breaths are much weaker than those of 
the elemental dragons, but far fewer monsters resist sound or shards. 
Their melee is also on the weak side by dragon standards, but most 
lesser creatures would be quite happy with it!

Chaos Drake
Chaos Drakes are powerful dragons of chaos. They can breathe chaos or 
disenchantment and eventually evolve into Great Wyrms of Chaos, though 
not as quickly as you might hope. Their breaths are much weaker than 
those of the elemental dragons, but far fewer monsters resist chaos or 
disenchantment; and though their melee is weak for a dragon, by more 
typical standards they fight quite well.

Balance Drake
Balance Drakes are a blend of Chaos and Law Drakes. They can breathe 
sound, shards, chaos or disenchantment and eventually evolve into Great 
Wyrms of Balance. Their breaths and attacks are weaker than those of 
Chaos and Law Drakes, but not by much.

Ethereal Drake
Ethereal Drakes are dragons of light and darkness. They begin life as 
modest Pseudo Dragons, but quickly evolve into Ethereal Drakes and then 
Ethereal Dragons. As they mature, they gain the ability to pass through 
walls and become more and more resistant to light, darkness and 
confusion. They are fairly weak fighters and have the weakest breaths 
in all of dragonkind, except for Steel Dragons which cannot breathe at 
all.

Crystal Drake
Crystal Drakes are dragons of a strange crystalline form. They breathe 
shards and fight powerfully with their razor-sharp claws and teeth. At 
high levels, they gain the power of reflection.

Bronze Dragon
Bronze Dragons are wyrms of perplexity. While they are not quite as 
strong as most other dragons, they eventually confuse monsters with 
their bite attack; also, they become more and more resistant to 
confusion as they mature.

Steel Dragon
Steel Dragons are magical dragons formed from rock. As they mature, 
their form hardens from stone into steel. Needless to say, their armor 
class is phenomenal, but their dexterity actually decreases with 
maturity. Steel dragons begin life being susceptible to cold damage, 
though they will eventually outgrow this vulnerability. They are not as 
fast as other dragons and have no powers whatsoever, not even the 
ubiquitous dragon breath! But their fighting is impossibly strong, 
putting all the other dragons to complete and utter shame. They also 
have extremely high hitpoints.
