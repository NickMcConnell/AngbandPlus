Command Descriptions

The following command descriptions are listed as the command name plus 
the underlying command key. This is followed by the command name and 
roguelike keyset key, if different from the underlying command key. 
Then comes a brief description of the command, including information 
about alternative methods of specifying the command in each keyset, 
when needed.

Several commands (tunnel, disarm, bash, open) are automatically 
repeated as many times as necessary (up to 99) if no specific repeat 
count is given and the always_repeat option has not been turned off. 
Some other commands allow using repeat counts as arguments; for 
example, commands which need a quantity can use the repeat count 
instead of asking for a quantity, allowing the use of 0d to drop all. 
Commands which ask for a quantity will convert any letters into the 
maximal legal value.

Inventory Commands

  Inventory List (i)
  Displays a list of objects being carried but not equipped. You have 
  up to 26 slots in your inventory, not counting equipment slots. 
  Identical objects can often form a "stack" which only occupies a 
  single slot, like the 4 torches, 26 arrows and 13 rations of food in 
  the sample below; stacks have a maximum size of 99 objects.
  
  Inventory | Equipment                                                 
   a) , 13 Rations of Food                                    13.0 lb
   b) - a Wand {tried}                                         0.2 lb
   c) ~ 4 Wooden Torches (with 2000 turns of light)           12.0 lb
   d) ( a Filthy Rag                                           2.0 lb
   e) ) a Small Leather Shield {average}                       5.0 lb
   f) ) a Small Leather Shield                                 5.0 lb
   g) | a Main Gauche {average}                                3.0 lb
   h) { 26 Arrows (3d4) (+0,+0)
                                                              45.4 lb
  Carrying 93.4 pounds (71% capacity).
  
  You can press / here to toggle between the inventory list, the 
  equipment list and potentially other item inventories like your 
  quiver.
   
  Equipment List (e)
  Use this command to display a list of the objects currently worn or 
  wielded by your character. Your character typically has 13 slots for 
  equipment, each corresponding to a different location on the body; 
  each slot may contain only a single object at a time, and each slot 
  may only contain objects of the proper type. Note that some races 
  (and most monster forms) have body types that differ from the typical 
  humanoid, so the number and types of your equipment slots can vary. 
  Here is a sample equipment list from a human warrior:
  
   a) | Right Hand: a Broad Sword (2d6) (+0,+0)               15.0 lb
   b) ) Left Hand : a Small Leather Shield [3,+0]              5.0 lb
   c) } Shooting  : a Short Bow (x2.50) (+0,+0)                3.0 lb
   d)   Quiver    :
   e)   Right Ring:
   f)   Left Ring :
   g)   Neck      :
   h) ~ Light     : a Wooden Torch (with 1983 turns of ligh    3.0 lb
   i) [ Body      : Chain Mail (-2) [14,+0]                   22.0 lb
   j)   Cloak     :
   k)   Head      :
   l)   Hands     :
   m)   Feet      :                                                     
                                                              48.0 lb   
  
  Each slot has a descriptive label (like "Right Hand") that determines 
  what type of object it may receive; the right hand and left hand, for 
  example, accept weapons and shields. And yes, you can wield two 
  weapons, or two shields! The slots for most items are very intuitive 
  (gloves go on your hands, helmets go on your head), but some might be 
  a bit surprising, like harps going into the Shooting slot.

  Inspect Item (I)
  This command lets you examine an item in detail, listing whatever 
  special powers of the object you have identified, mentioning if the 
  object still has hidden powers, and noting the item's weight and 
  estimated value. Here too, use / to toggle between your pack, 
  equipment, and other relevant inventories. This is an especially 
  handy command for artifacts and ego-items.

  Get Objects (g)
  This command will get any objects located on the same tile as the 
  player (Mogaminator applies). As a convenience, picking up items does 
  not consume time.

  Auto-Get Objects (^G)
  This command will get any objects located on the same tile as the 
  player (Mogaminator applies). In addition, this command will 
  automatically travel to and get other objects in line of sight. With 
  auto_get_objects enabled, any object registered for either 
  auto-pickup or auto-destroy will qualify for automatic get. If that 
  is too much for you (maybe you enjoy cleaning up after battles?), the 
  auto_get_ammo option only applies to objects inscribed with =g; which 
  is typically your ammo, or perhaps spikes on a ninja.
  
  The auto-get travels will terminate when there are no more visible 
  qualifying objects; if your pack becomes full; or if you are 
  disturbed for any reason, such as a nasty dragon waking up and 
  deciding to breathe on you. Auto-get is both safer and more limited 
  than travelling through the object list; auto-get usually only cleans 
  up a single room since the objects must be visible to qualify, while 
  the object list and the H/^E command allow lengthy automatic travels, 
  potentially into harm's way (although these journeys also stop if bad 
  things happen).

  Drop Item (d)
  This drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the dungeon 
  floor. If the floor spot you are standing on already has an object in 
  it, or rejects object drops altogether (doors, stairs, traps, some 
  terrain types like deep lava), the game will attempt to drop the item 
  onto an adjacent space. If nothing else works, the item will be 
  dropped onto a square that already has an object in it; but be warned 
  that if there simply are no acceptable squares nearby the object may 
  disappear entirely. If the pile selected for dropping contains 
  multiple items, you may specify a quantity.

  Destroy Item (k) or (^D)
  This destroys an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor. If 
  the selected pile contains multiple objects, you may specify a 
  quantity. You must always verify this command, except in the case of 
  worthless junk items.

  Wear/Wield Equipment (w)
  To wear or wield an object, use this command. Since only one object 
  can be in each equipment slot at a time, if you wear or wield an item 
  into a slot which is already occupied, the old item will first be 
  taken off, and may be dropped if there is no room for it in your 
  inventory.

  Take Off Equipment (t) or (T)
  Use this command to take off a piece of equipment and return it to 
  your inventory. If there is no room in your inventory for the item, 
  your pack will overflow and you will drop the item after taking it 
  off. Occasionally, you will run into a cursed item which cannot be 
  removed; these items normally penalize you in some way, and can only 
  be taken off after the curse has been removed.

Movement Commands

  Walk (with pickup) (;)
  Moves one step in the given direction. The square you are moving into 
  must not be blocked by walls or doors. You will pick up any items in 
  the destination grid if the always_pickup option is set. This command 
  can take a count and requires a direction. You may also use the 
  "original" direction keys (both keysets) or the "roguelike" direction 
  keys (roguelike keyset) to walk in a direction (they are keymapped to 
  this command). If the Mogaminator or the easy auto-destroyer is 
  active, specified objects will be picked up or destroyed.

  Walk (flip pickup) (-)
  This is just like normal move, except that the "Pick things up" 
  option is inverted. In other words, you will pick things up if and 
  only if always_pickup is not set. This command can take a count and 
  requires a direction. If the Mogaminator or the easy auto-destroyer 
  is active, specified objects will be picked up or destroyed.
  
  This is also the command for deliberately walking into a trap.

  Run (.) or (,)
  This command will move in the given direction, following any bends in 
  the corridor, until you either have to make a "choice" between two 
  directions or you are disturbed. You can configure what will disturb 
  you by setting the disturbance options. Run requires a direction. By 
  default Shift+DIR is keymapped to .DIR, although with the original 
  keyset this may run into technical limitations on some platforms. If 
  the Mogaminator or the easy auto-destroyer is active, specified 
  objects will be picked up or destroyed.

  Go Up Staircase (<)
  Climbs up if you are standing on an up staircase or shaft. In the 
  wilderness, toggles global map mode unless there are alert monsters 
  nearby.
  
  Unless you are playing in coffee-break mode or have activated the 
  ironman_downward option, there is always at least one up staircase on 
  every level. Going up a staircase will take you to either the surface 
  or a new dungeon level. Note that levels are semi-persistent; they 
  can be returned to while you remain in the dungeon (supposing up 
  staircases exist), but are lost forever when you return to surface.

  Go Down Staircase (>)
  Descends if you are standing on a down staircase or shaft. In the 
  wilderness, returns from global map to local map.
  
  There are always at least two staircases going down on each level, 
  except for quest levels (which have none until the quest monster is 
  killed) and the bottom levels of dungeons. Going down a staircase 
  will take you to a new dungeon level (see "Go Up Staircase" for 
  notes).

  Travel to Nearest Interesting Item (H or ^E)
  Locates and automatically travels to the nearest known item that is 
  unidentified, either has not been pseudo-ID'd or has been sensed as 
  an artifact or ego item, is not considered unworthy of picking up by 
  an active Mogaminator, and to which a known route has been mapped. 
  Convenient for quickly locating items you forgot to pick up or 
  identify after you have otherwise a dungeon level, or after killing a 
  high-level monster who dropped loot all over the place.

  Resume Journey (J) or Resume Travelling (()
  Resumes a previous travel that was interrupted before reaching its 
  target. This command can also be used in the monster and object lists 
  to start a new travel; for this purpose, the J key is also used by 
  the roguelike keyset.

Resting Commands

  Stay Still (with pickup) (,) or (.)
  Stays in the same square for one move. If you normally pick up 
  objects you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on. 
  This command can take a count. You may also use the "5" key (both 
  keysets). If the Mogaminator or the easy auto-destroyer is active, 
  specified objects will be picked up or destroyed.

  Rest (R)
  Resting is better for you than repeatedly staying still, and can be 
  told to automatically stop after a certain amount of time, or when 
  various conditions are met. In any case, you always wake up when 
  anything disturbing happens, or when you press any key. This command 
  requests a count if no count is specified; the count defaults to the 
  special value &, which means "rest until fully healed". Another 
  special value, * for "rest to full HP/SP", is also accepted.

Searching Commands

  Search (s)
  This command can be used to locate hidden traps and secret doors in 
  the spaces adjacent to the player. More than a single turn of 
  searching will be required in most cases. You should always search a 
  chest before trying to open it, since they are generally trapped; 
  though if nothing appears, you may have found a rare trapless chest. 
  This command can take a count, which is useful if you are fairly sure 
  of finding something eventually, since the command stops as soon as 
  anything is found.

  Toggle Search Mode (S) or (#)
  This command will take you into and out of search mode. When first 
  pressed, the message "Searching" will appear at the bottom of the 
  screen. You are now taking two turns for each command, one for the 
  command and one turn to search. This means that you are taking twice 
  the time to move around the dungeon, and therefore twice the food. 
  Search mode will automatically turn off if you are disturbed. You may 
  also turn off search mode by entering the Search Mode command again.

Alter Commands

  Tunnel (T) or (^T)
  Tunneling or mining is a very useful art. There are many kinds of 
  rock, with varying hardness, including:
  
    # Permanent Rock   Permanent
    # Granite          Very Hard
    % Quartz Veins     Hard
    % Magma veins      Soft
    : Rubble           Very Soft
  
  Quartz and Magma veins may sometimes contain treasure; known 
  treasures will be displayed as *, but not all treasures are visible 
  without detection. Rubble sometimes covers an object. Tunneling is 
  difficult unless you are wielding a heavy weapon or a digging 
  implement or your Strength is very high. This command can take a 
  count, requires a direction, and is affected by the always_repeat 
  option.

  Open a Door or Chest (o)
  To open a chest, you must use this command (for doors, simply walking 
  into a closed door automatically attempts to open it). If the door or 
  chest is locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based on your 
  disarming ability; if you open a trapped chest without disarming the 
  traps first, the traps will be set off. You may need several tries to 
  open a door or chest, and rarely doors will be jammed shut and need 
  to be bashed open. Open can take a count, requires a direction, and 
  is affected by the always_repeat option.

  Close a Door (c)
  Non-intelligent and some other creatures cannot open doors, so 
  shutting doors can be quite valuable. Broken doors cannot be closed. 
  Bashing a door open may break it. Close can take a count, requires a 
  direction, and is affected by the always_repeat option.

  Jam a Door (j) or Spike a Door (S)
  Many monsters can simply open closed doors, and can eventually get 
  through a locked door. You may therefore occasionally want to jam a 
  door shut with iron spikes. Each spike used on the door will make it 
  harder to bash down the door, up to a certain limit. Smaller monsters 
  are less able to bash down doors. In order to use this command, you 
  must be carrying iron spikes. Jam or Spike requires a direction.

  Bash a Door (B) or Force a Door (f)
  This command allows you to bash down jammed doors. Your bashing 
  ability increases with strength. Bashing open a door can (briefly) 
  throw you off balance. Doors that are stuck, or which have been 
  jammed closed with spikes can only be opened by bashing, and all 
  closed doors can be bashed open if desired. Bashing a door open may 
  permanently break it. Bash/Force can take a count, requires a 
  direction, and is affected by the always_repeat option.

  Disarm a Trap or Chest (D)
  You can attempt to disarm traps on the floor or on chests. If you 
  fail, there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off. You can 
  only disarm a trap after you have found it (with the Search command, 
  by detection, or by previously triggering it). Disarm can take a 
  count, requires a direction, and is affected by the always_repeat 
  option. Walking into known floor traps automatically attempts to 
  disarm them unless the easy_disarm option has been disabled; use - if 
  you wish to deliberately walk into a trap without disarming it.

  Alter Adjacent Grid (+)
  This all-purpose super-command allows the use of a single keypress to 
  select any of the "obvious" commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, 
  open, disarm, close). Ctrl-[dir] is by default macroed to be 
  equivalent to alter-[dir], in both keysets. Alter can take a count, 
  requires a direction, and is affected by the always_repeat option.

Spell and Prayer Commands

  Browse Magic List (b) or Peruse Magic List (P)
  All characters which can cast spells can use this command. When this 
  command is used, all of the spells available to you (or contained in 
  a selected magic book) are displayed, along with such information as 
  their level, the amount of mana required to cast them, and whether or 
  not you know the spell. And when you select a spell from the list, a 
  short description of the selected spell's effect will be displayed.

  Gain New Spells or Prayers (G)
  Use this command to actually learn new spells or prayers. When you 
  are able to learn new spells or prayers, the word Study will appear 
  in the status area of the screen. If you have a book in your 
  possession, containing spells or prayers which you may learn, then 
  you may choose to study that book. If you are a Priest, Paladin, 
  Ranger, Monk or Force-Trainer, your gods will choose a prayer for 
  you; other classes can choose which spell they wish to study, and 
  even study the same spell a second time. There are four books in each 
  realm, some normally found only in the dungeon.

  Use a Magic Spell/Mental Power (m)
  To use a book spell (or prayer), you must have previously learned the 
  spell and must have in your inventory a book from which the spell can 
  be read. Each spell has a chance of failure which starts out fairly 
  large but decreases as you gain levels. If you don't have enough mana 
  to cast a spell, you will be prompted for confirmation. If you decide 
  to go ahead, the chance of failure is greatly increased, and you may 
  lose a point of constitution. Since you must read the spell from a 
  book, you cannot be blind or confused while casting, and there must 
  be some light present.
  
  For classes who do not learn book spells but do learn magic or mental 
  powers through other means (commonly just by leveling up), this 
  command may obey slightly different rules. For most (but not all) 
  classes, this command will not work at all if your character is 
  Mundane or has equipped an Anti-Magic item.

  Use Bonus Power (U) or (O)
  Some races and classes have special natural abilities. For example, a 
  Cyclops may Throw Boulders and a Gnome may Blink away from danger. A 
  Warrior can learn the power of Sword Dancing. Also, it is possible to 
  become mutated and gain a power, such as the ability to shoot Laser 
  Beams from your eyes! If you have no special powers, this command 
  will not do anything.


Object Use Commands

  Eat Food (E)
  You must eat regularly to prevent starvation. As you grow hungry, a 
  message will appear in the status portion of the screen saying 
  Hungry. If you go hungry long enough, you will become Weak, then 
  start Fainting, and eventually starve to death. Use this command to 
  eat food from your inventory - though it is also possible to eat 
  straight from the floor...

  Fuel Lantern/Torch (F)
  If you are using a torch and have more torches in your pack, or you 
  are using a lantern and have flasks of oil in your pack, you can 
  refuel your light source with this command. Torches and Lanterns have 
  limited fuel capacity; in general, two flasks will fully fuel a 
  lantern and two torches will fully fuel a torch.

  Quaff Potion (q)
  Use this command to drink a potion, fully consuming it unless you are 
  a Potion-speciality Devicemaster. The effects could be good or bad, 
  depending on the potion.

  Read Scroll (r)
  Use this command to read a magic scroll. Reading a scroll causes the 
  parchment to disintegrate as the magic takes effect. Most scrolls 
  which prompt for more information can be aborted (by pressing ESC) 
  without consuming the scroll. Note that magic is fickle, and the 
  scroll must be read with care; mispronounce the incantations, and 
  nothing happens.
 
  Activate Item (A)
  You have heard rumors of special items deep in the dungeon that let 
  you breathe fire like a dragon or illuminate rooms with just a 
  thought. Should you ever be lucky enough to find such an item, this 
  command will let you activate its special ability. Only equipped 
  items can be activated, and they usually take a certain amount of 
  time to recharge before you can activate them again. Activations 
  resemble scroll, wand, staff and rod effects: all require Magic 
  Device Skill and have a chance to fail.

  Aim Wand (a) or Zap Wand (z)
  This command attempts to use a wand. Wand effects are normally bolts, 
  beams, balls or breaths, and so need to be aimed; accordingly, this 
  command requires a direction and can use a target.

  Use Staff (u) or Zap Staff (Z)
  This command attempts to use a staff. Staves normally either have an 
  area effect or affect a specific object, and therefore do not need to 
  be aimed.
 
  Zap Rod (z) or Activate Rod (a)
  This command attempts to use a rod; rods can have either staff-like 
  or wand-like effects. This command may require a direction (depending 
  on the type of rod, and whether you are aware of its type) and can 
  use a target.

  Inscribe an object (Z) or ({)
  This command inscribes a string on an object. The inscription is 
  displayed inside curly braces after the object description. The 
  inscription is limited to the particular object (or pile) and is not 
  automatically transferred to all similar objects. Certain 
  inscriptions give the game instructions for how to handle or label 
  the item; see [a] for more information.

  Uninscribe an object (})
  This command removes the inscription on an object. This command will 
  have no effect on "fake" inscriptions added by the game itself.

Throwing and Missile Weapons

  Fire Item (f) or (t)
  Fires a selected projectile suitable for your current ranged weapon, 
  provided that you have a ranged weapon equipped. Slings only shoot 
  pebbles and iron shots; bows only shoot arrows; and crossbows only 
  shoot bolts. Projectiles are typically fired from your quiver, but 
  can also be shot directly from your inventory or even from the floor. 
  This command requires a direction, and can take a target.

  Throw Item (v)
  You may throw any object carried by your character. The lighter the 
  object, the farther you can throw it. Only one object from a stack 
  may be thrown at a time. Thrown objects may or may not damage 
  monsters. Throwing an object can break it. Throwing a potion at a 
  wall always breaks it, potentially causing splash damage. This 
  command requires a direction, and can take a target.

  Set Target (*)
  This command allows you to aim your spells, arrows and such at a 
  specific monster or grid, even if they are not in one of the eight 
  compass directions; it works both inside and outside direction 
  prompts. This command can also be used as a substitute for the look 
  command, which is especially convenient if what you wish to look at 
  is a monster.
  
  The targeting prompt offers many options. The first target offered 
  will be the nearest monster in line of sight, with other monsters in 
  line of sight as alternative targets. Use direction keys to cycle 
  between monsters; + and - also work, but are less intuitive.
  
  If you wish to target (or inspect) a square with no monster on it, 
  press p or o, switching to a mode where direction keys simply move 
  the cursor. (This mode is automatically entered if no hostile 
  monsters are in line of sight. o and p are identical except in one 
  respect: pressing p moves the cursor to your own location.) At any 
  time, press 5, t or . to accept the current target, q or ESC to exit 
  targeting mode, r to recall lore about a currently targeted monster, 
  x to see all items on the target square, and J/( to select a square 
  as a travel target. See [b] for more detail.
  
  Note that when you cast a spell or fire an object at a target 
  location, the path chosen is the direct path towards that location, 
  which may or may not be the path you want. Sometimes, by clever 
  choice of a side location as your target, you may be able to aim at 
  squares not directly in line of sight:
    
    Position: an unknown grid [q,t,p,m,x,j,+,-,?,<dir>]                         
          ##........#.... #%%####
          #........\......      #
          %.......}{\@....      #
        %#%..........*....      #
       ##    ........*...   ... #
       #       ......*...   .d. #
       #        ..(.#*.     .#####
       #          .##*       T   #
       #    ^   #####*           ##########                                     
       ##       #   #*           '
       #        #  ##*         ############                                     
       #        #  #*        ###
       #        # ##*       ##                                                  
       ##       # # *        #                                                  
        #       # ##*        #                                                  
        #########  #*#########
    
  Notice that bright-red *? There's a dragon on that square I cannot 
  target directly; but I managed to include that square in my spell's 
  path by using p to target a location on the southern edge of the map.
  
  Note that bolt spells always stop at the first monster in the spell's 
  path, but beam and breath spells affect all squares, and ball spells 
  can reach the target square by flying over monsters' heads if 
  necessary. If the * command is used on the overworld map, it hooks 
  into the similar look command. Using the * command consumes no time.

Looking Commands

  Display Monster List (Y) or ([)
  This command displays a list of all monsters currently visible. This 
  is a quick way to tell if there are any uniques or other threatening 
  monsters nearby, and is most commonly used immediately after a summon 
  or detection.

  Display Object List (])
  This command displays a list of all known objects on the level, as 
  well as other interesting nearby features such as shops or dungeon 
  entrances. Pressing S with the object list active toggles whether 
  stairs are included in the object list. The object list is a handy 
  way to locate stairs, artifacts, unidentified items and other targets 
  of interest on the level, and makes it possible to travel to such 
  targets directly by scrolling down to the target and pressing J.

  Full Screen Map (M)
  This command will show a map of the entire dungeon, scaled to fit on 
  a single screen. Only the major dungeon features will be visible 
  because of the scale, so even some important objects may not show up 
  on the map. This is particularly useful for quickly identifying 
  unexplored areas of the dungeon or determining your location relative 
  to the dungeon's edges. This command takes no time.

  If the Mogaminator is active, specified objects can be displayed on 
  this map; this is an obsolete functionality, though, as it is always 
  more convenient to just use the ] object list.

  Locate Player on Map (L) or Where is the Player? (W)
  This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors 
  of the current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point 
  the map will be re-centered on the player if necessary. To scroll the 
  map around, simply press any of the "direction" keys. The top line 
  will display the sector location, and the offset from your current 
  sector. This command takes no time.

  Recenter Viewport (^V)
  This command re-centers the viewport on the player; the game does 
  automatically adjust the viewport as you move, but only when you 
  approach the edge. This command is a quicker alternative to the 
  Locate Player on Map command just discussed, though some players go a 
  step further and activate the center_player option ([c]).

  Look Around (l) or Examine Things (x)
  This command is used to look around at nearby monsters (to determine 
  their type and health) and objects (to determine their type). It is 
  also used to find out what objects (if any) are under monsters, and 
  if a monster is currently inside a wall. This command takes no time.
  
  This command is very closely related to the * targeting command, and 
  most of the targeting prompt's special keys also work in the look 
  prompt. It is often convenient to use * instead of this command, 
  especially if you wish to look at a monster; on the other hand, l/x 
  is better for inspecting town buildings.

Message Commands

  Repeat Level Feeling (^F)
  Repeats the current feeling about the dungeon level.

  View Previous Messages (^P)
  This command shows you all the recent messages. You can scroll 
  through them, or exit with ESCAPE. This command takes no time.

  Take notes (:)
  This command allows you to take notes, which will then appear in your 
  message list (prefixed with "Note:"). This command takes no time. It 
  also adds a tiny screenshot to your message log. For example:
  
    Note: These bats are so dead!!

  Game Status Commands
  
    Character Sheet (C)
    Brings up a full description of your character, including your 
    resistances, skill levels, current and potential stats, equipment, 
    inventory, home inventory, average damage in melee and ranged 
    combat, spell repertoire, quest history, and other information. 
    From this screen, you can use the | command to create a character 
    dump.
  
    Knowledge Menu (~)
    The command opens a menu from which you can select or recall 
    information about your character, artifacts, monsters, identified 
    objects, etc.:
    
    Object Knowledge            Dungeon Knowledge                       
      (a) Artifacts               (d) Dungeons                          
      (o) Objects                 (q) Quests                            
      (e) Egos                    (t) Terrain Symbols
      (_) Auto Pick/Destroy                                             
                                Self Knowledge

      (m) Known Monsters          (W) Weapon Damage                     
      (w) Wanted Monsters         (H) High Score List                   
      (u) Remaining Uniques                                             
      (k) Kill Count            Skills                                  
      (p) Pets                    (P) Proficiency                       
                                  (s) Spell Proficiency                 
    
    As you can see, there is a lot of information here; poke around and 
    you will see what's available.
  
    Display game time (^T) or (')
    This command shows you current date and time in the game, usually 
    with a short comment. (The basic information, without the comments, 
    is also available through the C character sheet.)
  
  Saving and Exiting Commands
  
    Save and Quit (^X)
    To save your game so that you can return to it later, use this 
    command. Save files will also be generated (hopefully) if the game 
    crashes due to a system error. After you die, you can use your 
    savefile to play again with the same options and lore.
  
    Save (^S)
    This command saves the game but doesn't exit. Use this frequently 
    if you are paranoid about having the computer crash while you are 
    playing.
  
    Quit (commit suicide) (Q)
    Kills your character and exits the game. You will be prompted to 
    make sure you really want to do this, and then asked to verify that 
    choice. Note that dead characters are dead forever.
  
  User Preference Commands
  
  See [d] for a description of the user preference commands together 
  with a detailed description of this function.
  
    Interact with Options (=)
    Allosw you to interact with options. Note that using the cheat 
    options may mark your savefile as unsuitable for the high score 
    list.
  
    Interact with Macros (@)
    Allows you to interact with macros. You may load or save macros 
    from user pref files, create macros of various types, or define 
    keymaps.
  
    Interact with Visuals (%)
    Allows you to interact with visuals. You may load or save visuals 
    from user pref files, or modify the attr/char mappings for the 
    monsters, objects, and terrain features.
  
    Interact with Colors (&)
    Allows the user to interact with colors. This command only works on 
    some systems.
   
    Reload Mogaminator Preferences ($)
    This command will reload "pickpref.prf" and 
    "pickpref-<<playername>>.prf" for the Mogaminator; only needs to be 
    used if you have edited these files during the game with an 
    external text editor.
  
    Edit Mogaminator Preferences (_)
    Allows you to edit your pickup preferences, and activates the 
    Mogaminator if it was not yet active. The ESC key will open the 
    menu in this editor. You can see and use all edit commands from the 
    command menu. Press ^Q or ^W to quit the editor.
  
  Help
  
    Help (?)
    Brings up the online help system. In some situations (like within 
    the help itself) it may bring up a specific help page.
  
    Identify Symbol (/)
    Use this command to find out what a character stands for; for 
    instance, by pressing /. you can find out that the . symbol stands 
    for a floor spot. Note that if you wish to see information about a 
    specific monster nearby, you should use the * command instead of 
    this command.
    
    If you do use Identify Symbol on a monster symbol, you will be 
    reminded of the species corresponding to the symbol and get a list 
    of all monsters of that species that you have seen. Similar 
    information is available through the ~ Knowledge Menu.
    
    There are four special commands you can use with Identify Symbol: 
    Ctrl-A to recall all known monsters, Ctrl-U to recall all known 
    uniques, Ctrl-N to recall all known non-uniques and Ctrl-M to 
    recall all known monsters matching a string you type. Press k to 
    sort these lists by number of kills, p to sort them by the native 
    depths of the monsters and ESC to exit.
   
    Game Version (V)
    This command will tell you what version of the game you are using, 
    as well as the current size of the map. For more information, see 
    [e].
  
  Extra Commands
  
    Repeat Last Command (n) or (X)
    This command repeats the previously executed command with all its 
    arguments. Very useful for repeatedly firing at or casting the same 
    spell at a given enemy.
  
    Record Command (")
    Commands that you enter may be recorded to any normal ASCII 
    character register. In fact, every command that you manually enter 
    is automatically recorded to the . register. When you repeat the 
    last command, you are really playing back the contents of this 
    special . register. But you can also record the next command to a 
    register of your choosing and then play it back manually later; for 
    example, the command sequence "Fmae*t records the command mae*t to 
    the F register in addition to the . register. You can later play 
    back this command with 'F whereas playing back with '. or n is only 
    valid on the very next turn.
  
    Playback Command (')
    As mentioned above, you may record commands with the " command and 
    play them back later with the ' command. Commands are stored in 
    registers, each of which is addressed with a single ASCII 
    character. For example, if you record a command with "t<cmd>, then 
    you may later play it back by pressing 't. These command registers 
    are temporary and will be erased every time you restart the game. 
    To view your recorded commands, choose the ' register (i.e., press 
    '' from the top level). You can then enter the register you wish to 
    use (e.g. ''t works the same as 't except that the register 
    contents of all recorded commands are displayed to you after you 
    press the second ').
    
    The playback command is rarely used, as macros and keymaps ([f]) 
    are usually preferable.
  
    Toggle Choice Window (^I)
    Toggles subwindow display between your inventory and your 
    equipment. This command only applies if you have an 
    inventory/equipment subwindow.
  
    Redraw Screen (^R)
    This command adapts to various changes in global options, and 
    redraws all of the windows. It is polite to use this command if 
    somebody starts watching your game when you play on angband.live; 
    also use this command if you feel there are graphical errors or the 
    game has not properly responded to visual changes you made. When in 
    doubt, use it.
          
    Create screen dump ())
    This command creates a document of the current screen and then 
    displays that document to you in the game's internal file viewer. 
    You may then save the document as either plaintext or as html, 
    using the | command. To create an html file, simply give the file 
    an html extension. Note that if you are playing with graphics 
    enabled, then this command will attempt to convert to normal 
    textual display before creating the screen dump.
  
    Command your pets (p)
    If you have pets, use this command to give orders or toggle pet 
    options. See [g] for details.
