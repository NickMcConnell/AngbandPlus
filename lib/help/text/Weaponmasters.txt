Weaponmasters

A Weaponmaster is exceptionally good with a single class of weapons, 
obtaining special combat bonuses and powers which depend on their 
chosen speciality. Focus is the key to success; weaponmasters are truly 
lousy with off-speciality weapons, but few can match the prowess they 
gain with something more suitable in their hands.

Axes
The mighty axe! Your blows will cleave with damage unsurpassed. 
Specializing in axes gives great offensive prowess, especially when 
your axe is wielded with two hands. However, this speciality offers 
little in the way of utility. Kill quickly as your life depends on it!

Bows
You will shoot to kill! The bowmaster gains techniques to enhance 
shooting, including more rapid firing, the ability to volley shots over 
the heads of intervening monsters, reduced ammo destruction, the 
ability to kill with a single arrow and much more. As a shooter, your 
missile prowess will be quite formidable, though your melee will be 
somewhat lacking.

Clubs
You will seek to club your opponents senseless! This speciality gains 
passive status effects against monsters, such as confusion, knock out 
and stunning. Also, you will gain some limited utility techniques. At 
high levels, your weapons will become more likely to score devastating, 
crushing blows against your hapless enemies.

Crossbows
The crossbowmaster shoots deadly bolts for great damage. Their bolts 
may explode powerfully damaging nearby monsters. Also, they may shoot 
so hard as to knock their opponents backwards!

Daggers
A knife in the back! This speciality favors dual-wielding and 
rogue-type behavior. The daggermaster can even assume the posture of 
The Flying Dagger which greatly enhances their low level dagger toss 
capability. Indeed, their prowess with the dagger toss is legendary and 
appears almost magical! At high levels, you will also gain formidable 
melee prowess with the Frenzy Stance. Finally, daggermasters have very 
strong short ranged teleport techniques that synergize well with their 
toss abilities.

Polearms
You don a grim face before setting out to reap your harvest of death. 
You will swing your weapon wide often affecting multiple surrounding 
opponents.

Shields
Specializing in shields gives excellent powers of defense and 
retaliation. In addition, you can even choose to melee with your shield 
rather than a normal weapon, bashing your opponents senseless. This 
form of combat is known as Shield Bashing and is unique to this 
speciality.

Slings
Watch out, Goliath! As a master of slings you will shoot pebbles with 
uncanny speed. Your shots may even ricochet off other monsters to score 
multiple hits. As with other archery specializations, your ammo will 
break less often.

Staves
Monkey King! You will battle opponents with a flurry of blows from your 
mighty staff and will be prepared to counter the attacks of your 
enemies. You can vault into battle and circle kick enemies for stunning 
effects, attacking them with your boots! You may even eventually clone 
yourself at great cost.

Diggers
A master of digging. You prefer rocky enclosures and don't mind lugging 
around a corpse or two, which you can bury in a pinch for a temporary 
bonus. You can choose one of several postures which allow you to use 
the digging bonus of your current weapon as an additional bonus, such 
as increased strength, constitution, or even speed! So keep your eye 
open for those +8 diggers!
