The Newbie Guide

Welcome to FrogComposband! This guide will attempt to give you a quick 
overview of the game and get you started on your path to slay the 
dreaded Serpent of Chaos.

Overview

FrogComposband is a single-player role-playing game where you, the 
brave adventurer, attempt to save (or conquer?) the world by defeating 
evil monsters including, eventually, the Serpent of Chaos. The road is 
long, and the path is treacherous. Many have tried and failed, and the 
dungeons are littered with the bones of would-be heroes, slaughtered by 
dark gods or dragons or demons or (in one ignominious case) a sheep. Do 
you have what it takes to succeed?

Creating a Character

Your first step will be to create your character. Since you are new to 
the game, you may want to choose Beginner Mode at the initial prompt. 
This will greatly limit the complexity of the character creation 
process and also activate coffee-break mode, a faster-paced version of 
the game with accelerated leveling-up and no wilderness. After playing 
a few characters to get an idea of how to play, you can start a new 
character in Normal Mode to view all the options and allow the 
wilderness. Hey, it's not like your first character is going to win 
anyway!

In Beginner Mode, the game is going to walk you through creating your 
character. You can refer to [a] for more detailed info, but the basics 
are that you will choose a sex, a race, a class and the stats you start 
with. While your sex is not important (to the game), your race and 
especially your class are key to everything that follows.

Don't sweat too much about race selection in Beginner Mode - all the 
classic Beginner Mode races are fairly strong, and although their 
strengths and weaknesses differ, any of them can play any class 
reasonably well. Klackons are an extremely strong race; they gain an 
innate speed bonus, as well as innate resistance to confusion (new 
players die to confusion a lot!). Another slightly less vanilla option 
is the werewolf: you gain the ability to change shape, even affecting 
which equipment slots you have. Werewolves are somewhat bad at magic, 
so this may not be the ideal (or at least the most thematic) choice for 
a beginning mage.

Class Choices

Normally, the game has a vast (overwhelming?) array of choices that 
offer myriad, diverse playstyles, and it can take a while to even learn 
what is available. For now, we'll consider a few basic approaches in 
order to get you going.

The easiest style (especially in the early game!) is 'Hack and Slash', 
and it is the essence of the warrior. As noted, almost any race will 
make a good one, but if you want to double down on it you could be a 
Half-Troll. Be warned: trolls are ugly and stupid, not to mention 
unpopular; shopkeepers are loath to sell to one as ugly as you, so you 
will have a somewhat harder time buying supplies. You can compensate by 
going on a killing rampage, which is more fun anyway! Key stats for 
Warriors include Strength, Dexterity and Constitution; but if you 
survive the early game you will want some Intelligence too, since even 
warriors need magical devices now and then.

Another style is to take the stealthy approach and play a rogue or a 
ninja. Both of these classes are quite strong in melee and combine that 
with some extra abilities: Ninjas gain special ninjutsu skills as they 
level up, while Rogues get to select a magical realm. Sorcery is a 
strong realm pick for any character, but there is also the special 
option of Burglary, designed uniquely for rogues. Not only is Burglary 
a powerful realm, it allows fun stuff like setting traps and picking 
pockets! Key stats for both Rogues and Ninjas include strength and 
dexterity; but a non-Burglary rogue should also invest in intelligence, 
as it will be his primary stat for spellcasting purposes.

Or you can go all in on magic and play a mage. Magic takes some time to 
get good with, and mages are quite squishy in the early game, so this 
route requires a bit more patience from you. I would suggest picking 
Chaos or Armageddon as your primary spell realm, and Sorcery as your 
secondary realm; Chaos and Armageddon give the good offense you will 
need to kill monsters, while Sorcery provides good utility spells. The 
key stat for mages is Intelligence, but you will also need decent 
Strength, simply to carry all the goodies you find.

Personality Choices

So you jumped straight to Normal Mode and need a personality as well?

You can pick most of them, but there are a few you should probably 
avoid. Lazy and Fragile are pure challenge personalities, so picking 
one of those makes the already steep development curve even steeper. 
Sexy sounds appealing but tends to give newbies pain. Chaotic and Split 
are pretty wild rides; you may want to start with something a bit 
calmer. Munchkin is a deliberately balance-breaking god personality, so 
don't pick that. Finally, avoid Mundane unless your class is a pure 
fighter like Warrior or Weaponsmith. Any of the remaining personalities 
you should do okay with.

Many new players do select Normal Mode right away; but for most of this 
guide, the assumption will be that you stuck to Beginner Mode. Not only 
does it keep the game simpler, it keeps the explanations simpler too!

Equipping for Danger

Once you have completed the birth process, you will find yourself in 
the town on the surface. Since you picked Beginner Mode, there will be 
only one dungeon and no wilderness to explore. You will spend most of 
your adventures in the dungeon (if you live!), but return to the 
surface regularly to buy and sell equipment, complete town quests, and 
leave and pick up items at your home. When you start, you have some 
initial gear that varies with your class, and most of it should already 
be equipped for you. You also have a small amount of gold which you can 
use to augment your supplies for that first trip into danger.

So, what do you see at first?

Well, that @ on the left side of the screen is you for starters. Also, 
those # characters are walls and you can see they are shaped into 
buildings for the various shops. Each building has a number or '+' 
character to represent its entrance; you may enter by simply moving 
onto that square. Each number stands for a different type of shop. You 
can move about with the numpad keys, and look about with the l or * 
command followed by the numpad keys. (If you do not have a numpad, you 
should probably turn on the roguelike keyset through the = options 
menu; relying solely on the four arrow keys is too much of a pain when 
you need to move diagonally.) That f is a monster and you should look 
at it with the * command to see if it seems threatening:
 
 Monster: a Scrawny cat [r,q,t,p,o,x,j,+,-,?,<dir>]

Hmmm, probably no need to worry about Ms. Kitty.


Notice the Study (1) on the bottom right of the screen, indicating you 
can study one new spell. If you are playing a mage, learning spells (G 
to Gain a spell) should be your top priority; but at the first level, 
you can only learn one, so make it count. I recommend learning Magic 
Missile first, assuming you followed my advice and chose the Chaos 
realm - as a mage, you really need to use magic to kill stuff, so your 
first spell has to be something offensive. Later on, when you are more 
experienced, you may pick Detect Monsters from the Sorcery realm. To 
cast a spell, use the magic command (m) and follow the instructions. 
Not every class can learn a spell right away; non-Burglary rogues, for 
example, must reach character level 5 (CL5) in order to learn their 
first spell.

Next, you should shop for gear. I recommend buying some means of 
escape, such as scrolls of Teleportation or Phase Door from the Alchemy 
Shop (5). Also, you will want Potions of Cure Serious Wounds from the 
Temple (4). If you are playing a rogue, try to buy a sling and some 
ammo (pebbles or shots) from the Weapon Smiths (3), as well as a quiver 
to put your newly-bought ammo in. When you enter a store, you will see 
a list of inventory, as well as a list of commands to use; simply 
follow the instructions to make a purchase.

In my case, I bought a sling and some iron shots; unfortunately, no 
quivers were for sale. (Each type of ranged weapon uses a corresponding 
type of ammo; pebbles and shots go with slings. Arrows are for bows and 
bolts are for crossbows, so they wouldn't have helped me here!) Now, 
the sling won't do me any good in my pack: I need to equip it, which I 
do with the w command. It will now appear if I press e to check my

in the roguelike keyset), press * to pick a target and 5 to select the

Sorry about that, Ms. Kitty! She's not dead yet, but will be shortly. I 
want you to notice a few things. First, as you play the game, notice 
that messages will be displayed in the top region of the screen. Back 
when I was a youngster, the game only had a single message line, and we 
hapless players were plagued with -more- prompts out the wazoo, not to 
mention sore fingers from all the extra keypresses! You may still get a 
-more- from time to time; if you do, simply press SPACE when you are 
finished reading, and the next batch of output will be displayed. The 
messages will clear automatically after you enter your next command, so 
make sure you are done reading before pressing any keys. You can always 
review messages with the Previous Messages command (CTRL+P).

Next, on the right hand side of the screen you can see a status bar 
(f[*--------]). This is very important - it tracks your current target, 
or the monster you most recently damaged. In this case, it shows me the 
health of Ms. Kitty, and you can see she is in some pretty dire 
straits. (See [b] for an explanation of why that last * turned violet!)

Finally, notice my shot ({) laying on the ground next to Ms. Kitty. 
Sometimes your projectiles will break on impact; but if they don't, 
you'll want to go gather them up after you're done fighting. You can 
pick up objects by moving on top of them and using the get command (g); 
or if you use the = options menu to turn the always_pickup input option 
on, then objects will be automatically picked up on walkover.

You could probably use the n (or roguelike X) Repeat Last Action 
command here to finish Ms. Kitty off, but killing cats is not your main 
goal in this game: it is time to move on. If you have money left over, 
go to the General Store (1) and buy a lantern and some oil; lanterns 
cast more light than torches, and so allow you to see further in the 
dark. Be sure to equip your lantern to actually use it (w to wear an 
item). If you still haven't run out of money, go to the Mushroom Store 
(0) and buy some mushrooms of Fast Recovery and Cure Confusion.

Stores do not always sell the same items; every so often they restock, 
getting rid of some old items and acquiring new ones, but the 
early-game staple items mentioned above should be reliably available as 
you begin the game.

Hopefully you managed to shop without too much trouble from the locals 
(t), but occasionally the townsfolk will interact with you. This may be 
simply annoying, as there are plenty of drunks about, but it can also 
be dangerous as urchins have been known to steal gold and you look like 
an easy mark. You can attack a monster by simply moving into it 
(assuming you have a weapon equipped), or by shooting it as shown 
above; but if you are a mage, you should use your offensive spells (m) 
instead. Spell target selection works the same way as for archery: * 
activates target mode, and *5 always targets the nearest monster.

My First Trip Down

There are two main things that you can do once you are finished 
shopping. You could head over to the Count's Castle (that's the big 
multi-entrance building up north), request your first town quest and 
then try to complete that. But let's take the other path and head 
straight into the dungeon!

In Beginner Mode, there is only one dungeon to enter. The > character 
represents a dungeon entrance. >, in general, refers to a down 
staircase; but dungeon entrances > and quest entrances > are 
color-coded to stand out. Similarly, < refers to stairs up. By some 
cosmic accident, these are also the keys you press to take the stairs: 
> to go down and < to go up. What could be easier to remember? So move 
to the stairs down to Angband and get going!

As you walk about, beware of monsters and use the look command (*) 
together with the recall option (r) to get a monster description. For 
example:

Angband: L2

In this case, a previous character had encountered a soldier ant, so I 
have some basic knowledge of this type of monster - not very much, but 
I do know it gets one attack per round and is worth 2 XP to kill 
(actually a fair bit more because of coffee-break mode's accelerated XP 
gain!). This illustrates what the game calls Monster Lore. As you 
battle monsters, you learn more about them, and the game tracks your 
knowledge for you. All of the memory is retained in your savefile so 
that future characters may benefit. After killing a foe, you can recall 
details of your glory through the ~ command (Knowledge Menu), followed 
by m for monster knowledge and arrows to select the appropriate 
monster. Notice that the description updates as you learn more.

At this point, you basically explore the current level. In normal mode 
you could walk back to town at any time by going back up those stairs 
you just descended, but coffee-break mode disables up-stairs, so read a 
scroll of Word of Recall when you wish to return to town. You can also 
find new stairs down to deeper depths. Basically, the deeper you go, 
the more difficult things become - but the quality of the loot also 
improves, inviting you ever deeper...

So, walk around a bit and kill stuff. Don't worry too much about dying 
as it will probably happen quite a bit at first. And if it does, the 
next time you load this savefile the birth process will give you an 
extra option to Quick Start this character, which basically skips the 
entire birth process and starts a character identical to the last one.

I will continue to play a bit. You can just sit back and watch! ...

But never fear, I can quickly start over. If I load my old character's 
savefile now, there is a new option:

    q) Quick Start

Choosing q puts you in the character creation menu with your old race, 
class, stats and personality already selected. This is a brand new 
character, so any objects I acquired (like that sling) are gone, and I 
have no experience. However, my monster memory survives, so I don't 
have to learn what soldier ants do all over again.

Go ahead and play a bit. Entering the dungeon immediately was probably 
not the best idea; for a sufficiently strong character (which rogues 
are), doing the first town quest (Thieves' Hideout) right off the bat 
gives a nice early leg-up. The first quest is rated as danger level 5, 
so doing it at CL 1 is a bit risky; but you get a valuable item as your 
reward for completing it, and the money you find in the quest lets you 
buy key supplies like Mushrooms of Cure Confusion. Moreover, you can 
then request the highly rewarding Pest Control quest!

At this point, the tutorial is over and I'll just give some basic 
tidbits about the game.

Tidbits

Every monster uses a unique ASCII character that sort of tells you what 
it is. For example, rats use the letter 'r' while orcs use the letter 
'o'. When you see a character you don't understand, press * to look at 
it. If it is a monster, you can then press r to recall information 
about it, including a description that will give you more information. 
Other characters like '/' and '!' represent objects that you may pick 
up (g to get) and then use.

How you use an object will depend upon its type. Some common examples 
are:

Char  Object         Usage
====  ============== =========================================================
,     Food           E to eat it. Do this whenever you feel hungry.
!     Potion         q to quaff it. Try to identify the potion first.
?     Scroll         r to read it.
?     Spellbook      b to browse it. G to gain a spell. m to cast.
-     Wand           a to aim it.

If you want to know what a specific symbol stands for, type /, and then 
the symbol. For instance, if you're wondering what all the t's are, 
type /t, and the game will tell you that these are townspeople. You can 
inspect individual items, features, and monsters with the * targetting 
command (see [c] for more details on this). Other useful commands that 
help you figure things out include the Y (or [) View Monster List 
command and the O (or ]) View Object List command.

From here on we'll be giving detailed dungeon survival information. 
Some of it is intuitive, and some of it you aren't likely to find out 
without a lot of deaths first. If you want to experience the painful 
learning process in all its glory, don't read further. If, however, 
you're sick and tired of dying, read ahead.
 
On Weapons and Multiple Blows

Some characters will start the game being able to get multiple blows 
per round with their weapon when attacking. How many blows you get 
depends on your class, your weapon weight, your Strength, your 
Dexterity, and whether you are wielding the weapon with both hands or 
only one hand. Check your Character Sheet (type C):

And then either scroll down to the Melee section, or press m to 
navigate more quickly:

In my case, this is a newborn adventurer still using his starting 
dagger. But you'll notice that he is getting multiple blows per round, 
2.42 in this case. What could that possibly mean? Actually, it's rather 
simple: 42% of the time I will get 3 attacks per round while 58% of the 
time, only 2. This is more than most new characters would get: Rogues 
get bonuses to strength and dexterity, and light weapons such as 
daggers give more blows. You'll notice, though, that despite the 2.42 
attacks my damage is still rather pathetic: only 11 per round.

The Weapon Info screen also displays melee accuracy. Of course, you 
won't hit every time you swing; accuracy depends on your skill with the 
weapon as well as its magical bonuses, if any. It also depends on your 
fighting skill, shown on the initial Character Sheet above under the 
Skills section for Melee (mine is Good). Your Melee skill increases 
with stats (Strength and Dexterity) as well as experience (Level). All 
of this competes against the monster's armor class (AC); basically, 
some monsters are harder to hit than others. Dragons, for example, are 
notoriously tough-skinned.

You may also see detailed information on your missile weapon in your 
character sheet. It is displayed right after the melee section 
(provided you are actually wielding a shooter), and can be quickly 
navigated to by pressing s:

 Shooting: a Sling (x2) (+0,+0)
 Range   : 160'
 Shots   : 1.39
 Mult    : 2.04x
 Profic  : Beginner (+0 To Hit)
 To Hit  : 0 + 4 = 4
 Xtra Dam: 0 (Multiplier Does Not Apply)

 Ammo #1 : 30 Rounded Pebbles (2d3) (+0,+0)                   AC Hit

 Weight  : 0.4 lbs                                            50 63%            
 To Hit  : 0 + 4 = 4                                         100 30%            
 To Dam  : 0 (Multiplier Applies)                            150  5%            
 To Dam  : 0 (Multiplier Does Not Apply)                     175  5%            
 Damage                                                      200  5%            
 Crits   : 1.06x (4.1%)                                     
 Normal  : 8/11                                                                 

In this case, you see I get multiple shots, but ranged combat works a 
bit differently than melee combat. Rather than taking all of your 
allowed shots in a single round, you take one at a time, but the game 
charges you less than the full amount of energy per shot. I haven't 
explained the speed system yet, but suffice it to say that less energy 
per action means you move faster, and can do more before any nearby 
monsters get a chance to act.

These two screens, Weapon Info and Shooter Info, will become more and 
more useful to you as you play the game. Don't worry if you don't 
understand everything displayed on them at the moment.

On Armor and Resistance

We just saw how monsters have this attribute called armor class, and 
how this makes them harder to hit. Similarly, the player has an armor 
class which is determined by the armor they are currently wearing as 
well as their dexterity. In addition to making you harder to hit, AC 
also actually reduces the damage from certain types of melee attacks, 
so it is a very important attribute that you will want to increase as 
much as possible. If ever you find yourself getting destroyed in melee, 
you'll want to look for better AC from your gear.

Here is my Character Sheet where you can see my starting AC:

In addition to AC, though, the player has a very important set of 
resistances. Or, in this case, rather a lack of resistances. Scroll 
down to the equipment section of your character sheet, or press e to 
navigate more quickly. Here you get to see, in all its gritty detail, 
how woefully inadequate your starting character actually is. Here is my

You'll notice a group of attributes for resistances and another for 
miscellaneous abilities along with some additional groupings for Slays 
and such. Let's just focus on Resistances for the time being.

So what is resistance and why should you care? Basically, monster 
attacks often have an elemental flavor to them. Their damage has a 
'type'. For example, a fire-breathing dragon breathes... well, fire! 
And your fire resistance helps you withstand that particular type of 
damage. Many damage types also have nasty side-effects; sticking with 
our example, fire attacks can destroy items in your pack (especially 
scrolls, staves and spellbooks), and fire resistance helps out here as 
well. Here is a short summary of common attack types, as well as when 
you'd like to have resistance (press [d] for a more detailed list). Be 
warned that some monster attacks can be very deadly to the unprepared!

Type       Comment
====       =============================================================
Acid       Destroys scrolls/staves, damages armor, can reduce CHR.
           Resist by DL20-30.
Elec       Destroys rings/wands, can reduce DEX.
           Resist by DL30.
Fire       Destroys scrolls/staves/spellbooks, can reduce STR.
           Resist by DL20-30.
Cold       Destroys potions, can reduce STR.
           Resist by DL30.
Poison     Does high damage, but with some delay.
           Can be cured with potions or mushrooms.
Nexus      Scrambles stats and teleports you, sometimes to
           very unexpected places. Not very damaging.
Shards     Destroys potions, causes wounds. Resistance not needed before
           DL40, but becomes extremely important in late game.
Confusion  Confuses you so you can't act normally.
           Carry mushrooms and potions to cure. See [e].
Paralysis  Freezes the player so you lose turns.
           Get Free Action by DL25 or Old Man Willow quest. See [f].

My character is not completely hopeless. Being a High-Elf, I begin with 
Light Resistance (30%) and See Invisible. The latter gives me a chance 
to see ghosts and other invisible monsters. Monsters you can't see can 
be very annoying, not to mention deadly! See Invisible isn't perfect, 
though, as it only gives me a chance; additional sources, as well as 
better Searching, would help make it more reliable.

And while your race can grant resistances and abilities, most of the 
time these come from your gear. The 'abcd...' list across the top of 
each column corresponds to my current equipment set, and the 
corresponding item character is displayed if an item is actually 
equipped in that slot (e.g. | for my dagger and } for my sling). You 
can track your current resistances and abilities here, and see where 
you are getting them from. The '@' character corresponds to the player 
(displayed as an @, remember?); this slot lists innate race or class 
abilities, as well as any temporarily acquired magical enhancements.

In general, you will want to cover as many resistances as possible. 
They are not so important early in the game, but as you descend deeper, 
you will learn what you need and when. Abilities are often optional, 
except for Free Action and See Invisible which you will want by DL20-25 
if possible. (You can get by without See Invisible if you are lucky 
enough to have full Telepathy.)

Note that resistances stack. If two items grant fire resistance, your 
resistance percentage goes up (though not linearly). Multiple sources 
of a given resistance also help to prevent many of the nasty side 
effects for various damage types. By the midgame, you will want to have 
two sources of resistance to all of the four base elements (Acid, Fire, 
Cold and Electricity) to limit both direct damage and item loss. See 
[g] for more details on avoiding damage to items.

OK, I cannot help thinking that the starting character sheet is lame, 
since every single attribute is empty. Here is a more interesting 
sample from a Tanar'ri Demon character I played earlier (notice the 
different body type? This was a Monster Mode character, where weird 
body types are common):

Notice how the resistances stack, as well as how I have most of the 
resistances covered? This character is ready for the Serpent of Chaos!

On Skills

Your character sheet also indicates your mastery (or lack thereof) of a 
number of skills:

           ========== Skills =========
           Melee      : Amber[15]
           Archery    : Good
           SavingThrow: Amber[7]
           Stealth    : Superb
           Perception : Fair
           Searching  : Fair
           Disarming  : Superb
           Device     : Superb

Apart from the obvious Melee and Archery, there are six others; your 
level in a particular skill depends on your race, class, personality, 
stats and equipment, and you will also gain class-dependent skill 
bonuses as you level up. With the exception of Stealth, your class 
usually accounts for the bulk of your aptitude for a particular skill, 
especially after you have leveled up a bit.

Although resistances are a more obvious place to look for character 
weaknesses to remedy, you should not forget your skills either. In 
particular, Stealth will help you a lot in the early game - you can 
sneak around gathering loot and picking your fights without being 
constantly buried in unwelcome enemies. If you survive to the late 
game, Device Skill becomes even more important - all characters (except 
Berserkers) rely on magical devices to some extent, and some valuable 
devices are extremely hard to use if your Device Skill is lacking. 
Saving Throw is also nice; it allows you to resist evil curses, and 
even improves your chances against paralysis.

Searching, Perception and Disarming are less important skills, although 
they do have their uses; in particular, Searching helps you see 
invisible monsters more often. Both Searching and Perception allow you 
to perceive hidden doors and traps (Searching when you are actively 
looking for them, Perception when you're not). The Disarming skill 
makes you better at disarming traps without triggering them, improves 
your ability to unlock doors, and affects the fail rate on Rogues' 
panic teleports. Searching and Perception are closely related; an item 
that improves your Searching will also improve your Perception.

On Important Magical Items

Magical items are an important part of every player's repertoire, even 
the warrior's. There are several types of magic that everybody needs.

  Teleportation and Escape
  
  It is very easy to become surrounded, or cut off from a safe retreat. 
  The mightiest of warriors can become overwhelmed by sheer numbers; 
  and this doesn't even account for the fact that many monsters can 
  summon other monsters who themselves summon monster-summoning 
  monsters... Things can go bad in a heartbeat, and when they do, 
  you'll want to have a magical means of escape at the ready.
  
  Phase Door     This is a short range teleport; it works as an escape 
                 in confined quarters or against monsters with no 
                 ranged attacks, and is also useful as a tactical tool 
                 if you wish to avoid melee.
  
  Teleport       A longer range escape that is the mainstay of most 
                 retreats. However, this escape is a bit risky as you 
                 may land in a worse situation than you started in.
  
  Teleport Away  This teleports all monsters in a line away, but many 
                 monsters resist and some are immune. It is generally 
                 useful for getting rid of a single troublesome 
                 opponent while preserving your current position.
  
  Teleport Level This is the safest escape, moving you up or down an 
                 entire dungeon level. You abandon the current level 
                 and all of its goodies, although sometimes you can 
                 find your way back through the new level's staircases.
  
  Destruction    This powerful spell removes everything (including 
                 artifacts!) from the area around you, blasting the 
                 surroundings and causing rock to fall from the 
                 ceiling. If you're ever in deep trouble, this is a 
                 good way to escape. However, even Destruction isn't 
                 foolproof: monsters other than summons get a saving 
                 throw and can avoid being removed. Also, Destruction 
                 does actually require the area to have a ceiling... I 
                 recommend saving scrolls of Destruction for the final 
                 battle; you will need plenty to deal with all of the 
                 Serpent's summons.
  
  Healing and Recovery
  
  During your adventures, things will hurt you. This cannot be avoided. 
  Fortunately, there are many magical potions that cure your wounds or 
  help against status ailments such as confusion or poison.
  
  Cure Light Wounds    Restores a small amount of hitpoints, perhaps 20 
                       or so. And while it won't completely cure cuts, 
                       it does reduce their effects. (Cuts cause you to 
                       bleed out, losing hitpoints every turn, although 
                       small cuts tend to heal before you die.)
  
  Cure Serious Wounds  Restores a bit more hp, perhaps 35 or 40. It is 
                       also more effective at curing cuts. This is the 
                       staple potion that most early game characters 
                       should rely on.
  
  Cure Critical Wounds Even better! It heals about 50-60 hp and cures 
                       both cuts and stunning completely.
  
  Curing               Does not restore any HP, but cures almost every 
                       status ailment - cuts, stunning, confusion, even 
                       hallucinations and blindness (always good to see 
                       who is attacking you, not to mention be able to 
                       read your scrolls and spellbooks!). Extreme 
                       poisoning may be only partially cured.
  
  Some mushrooms can also be very handy:
  
  Cure Confusion       Cures all confusion. Extremely useful in the 
                       early game, being cheaper and more reliably 
                       found than Potions of Curing; usually obsoleted 
                       by the midgame, as your stockpile of Potions of 
                       Curing grows and you start finding gear that 
                       provides resistance to confusion.
  
  Cure Poison          Cures all poison. Most potions (and even spells) 
                       only partially cure massive poisoning, so this 
                       reliable option is very convenient in the later 
                       game, especially for characters with low Poison 
                       resistance.
  
  Fast Recovery        Restores a small amount of hitpoints (around 
                       10), reduces cuts a bit, and speeds your 
                       regeneration.
  
  The above items are readily available in the town at the Temple and 
  Shroomery, and you should stock up on them as much as possible. The 
  following potions must be found in the dungeon or quests or purchased 
  in the Black Market:
  
  Healing   Big time hp recovery at about 300hp. Also, most status 
            ailments are cured except for fear, hallucinations and 
            poison. These potions are not all that rare, but the final 
            battles can eat up a lot of them, especially on melee 
            builds, so only use them when necessary to make sure you'll 
            have enough at the end.
  
  *Healing* Bigger time hp recovery at about 1000hp. Also, most status 
            ailments are cured except for fear and hallucination. These 
            potions are very rare, and most of them should be saved for 
            the final two battles.
  
  Life      Restores your stats, all your hp and removes all status 
            ailments except Fear. These potions are so rare they should 
            be saved for the final battle.
  
  Knowledge
  
  When you find a new object, you generally won't know anything about 
  it. In order to learn about the objects you find, you need some means 
  of knowledge. Every player has an innate sense about some of the 
  objects they find, and simply walking over the object (or at the very 
  least carrying the object around in your pack for a while) can give 
  you a clue as to its worth. This ability is called pseudo-ID (see [h] 
  and [i]). Pseudo-ID only really works on equipment; it can give 
  feelings about devices, but these feelings are not of much practical 
  help.
  
  Pseudo-ID does not tell you very much. You can attempt to learn more 
  by trying the object out; for example, you can eat a newly found 
  mushroom, or quaff that new potion in your pack. However, this is 
  very risky, as mushrooms and potions can have horrible effects! For 
  magical devices like wands, rods and staves, trying them as you find 
  them is a more acceptable idea; but really you want a Staff of 
  Identify or another reliable source of Identify.
  
  Even Identify only gives cursory knowledge of an object, revealing 
  its full name and magical combat bonuses or AC bonuses, as well as 
  any attributes you have learned to recognize through your previous 
  experience with similar items. For potions, scrolls and mushrooms, 
  Identify is enough (and you will even learn to recognize similar 
  future objects without the need to Identify them at all!); but for 
  magic devices, and especially for ego and artifact equipment, 
  important details might not be revealed by Identify.
  
  The second means of enhanced knowledge, *Identify*, gives complete 
  information about the object, including all the powers and 
  resistances that simple Identify might not reveal. Both Identify and 
  *Identify* are available in scroll and device form. Both are also 
  available as a town service (for a price), and this is the most 
  common way items are *Identified*. It is also possible to *Identify* 
  items simply by selling them, but then you don't have the item 
  anymore!
  
  Detection and Mapping
  
  Detecting threats and knowing the surrounding terrain are of 
  paramount importance in the dungeon. Rods of Detection are your 
  all-purpose detection package, and once you find one you will likely 
  carry it for the rest of the game unless you have an equivalent 
  spell. During the earliest part of the game you might be using Detect 
  Monsters instead, maybe even Detect Traps.
  
  Staves of Enlightenment, which map the surrounding areas, are another 
  item you might carry for nearly the whole game. Rods of Illumination, 
  which light up rooms, are also very convenient to have; it is easy to 
  miss something deadly (or valuable) in the dark.  
  
  Returning to Town
  
  There is a magic item, called Word of Recall (scrolls) or just Recall 
  (devices), that will take you back and forth between the surface and 
  the dungeons. Good thing, too: with wilderness off, this is the only 
  way to return to the town at all! And wilderness on, it means you 
  don't need to climb up and down 100 flights of stairs all the time, 
  or take the same onerous wilderness journeys over and over again.
  
On Weapons, Armor and Slays

Potions, Scrolls and devices are not the only magical items around. You 
can also find magical armor and equipment. We already discussed 
resistances above, and magical equipment is the usual place to find 
these attributes. Magical weapons often are more deadly against certain 
enemies, an attribute known as slays.

Your equipment will always carry around little numbers that tell you 
how effective it is. Armors take this form:

  A Robe (+x,+y) [a,+b] (+c)

Weapons take this form:

  A Long Sword (XdY) (+x,+y) [+b] (+c)

What do all these numbers mean?

(+x,+y) Bonuses to your accuracy (to-hit) and damage (to-dam) 
        respectively. These are added to whatever other bonuses you 
        have when you attack. These numbers are displayed for all 
        weapons (even if they are zero), and are displayed for armors 
        if they are other than zero. Many body armors have a small 
        negative number before the base AC (see below); this is a 
        penalty to your accuracy (your armor is so heavy that you have 
        trouble moving around in it), but is almost always small enough 
        to be ignored. The bonuses may apply to melee only, archery 
        only, both melee and archery, or magical spells only, depending 
        on the item.

[a,+b]  The item's base armor class and magical bonus to armor. The 
        higher, the better. While theoretically, a weapon could provide 
        a base armor bonus, none of them do, and only a few weapons 
        have a magical bonus to armor.

(+c)    This is the item's magical bonus to other statistics (and is 
        sometimes referred to as its pval). Possibilities include one 
        or more of your stats (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, 
        Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma), your speed or your stealth. 
        Your searching or infravision might also be improved. There are 
        other possibilities and learning the effects of this bonus 
        often requires you to *Identify* the object.

(XdY)   These are the damage dice of a melee weapon. When you hit an 
        opponent, the game rolls a Y sided die X times to figure out a 
        base damage. This base damage can be multiplied by any slays on 
        the weapon, and also by critical hits (lucky blows on your 
        part). Then, the game adds all your damage bonuses to the 
        total, including the +y from the (+x,+y) discussed above. So a 
        melee weapon can be good because it has good damage dice (e.g. 
        (5d6) (+0,+0)) or because it has a high damage bonus (e.g. 
        (1d5) (+5,+30)). Ideally, it would have both: (5d6) (+5,+30)!

In addition to these attributes, all of which are revealed by Identify, 
weapons and armors may have additional bonuses. Both may grant a 
particular resistance that we discussed earlier. In additions, weapons 
often have slays that target a specific class of monster. Slays work by 
multiplying the base damage roll (the (XdY) just discussed), and the 
multiplier varies with the type of slay. For example, a weapon of Slay 
Orc multiplies the damage dice by a factor of 2.8, while a *Slay Orc* 
weapon might (I say, might!) multiply by as high a factor as 4.5. 
Obviously, this means more on a (5d6) weapon than on a (1d5) weapon, so 
slays are more valuable on weapons with high dice. You usually need to 
*Identify* a weapon to learn its slays, unless you have seen the same 
slay on a similar weapon before; inspect items (I) to see everything 
you know about them.

On Dungeon Exploration

We'll close this Newbie guide with some various tips on exploring the 
dungeon.

  On Secret Doors
  
  Throughout the dungeon, many doors are hidden from view. To find 
  them, use the search command (or press S/# to toggle Searching Mode, 
  then stay still). It helps if you know where to search; usually, 
  situations like this will have secret doors (walls likely to contain 
  secret doors are highlighted in red for this example):
   
  #####  ###'###  ######    #######
  #@...  ..'@'..  ..@'.#    ..'@...
  #####  #######  ####'#    #######
   
  In general, if you see a door by itself in a corridor, there are 
  usually others nearby. If you find a corner in a corridor with two 
  doors, look for more. Intersections often have some secret doors. 
  Finally, secret doors will never be in a situation where you have to 
  move diagonally to open them. The dead-end situation (the first one) 
  usually does have a secret door, but not always. If you search for a 
  while and don't find anything, just give up and move on. Sometimes a 
  dead end will occur near the end of a map, where there is no room to 
  have a continuing corridor, and so no secret door is generated.
  
  On Level Feelings
  
  After you have been on a new level for a considerable length of time, 
  you receive a feeling giving you a vague idea how good the level is. 
  In general, the more scary the feeling sounds, the better the items 
  on the level, or the more dangerous the monsters. Probably the 
  latter... A special feeling almost invariably means there is an 
  undiscovered artifact on the level, so take the time to locate it.
  
  The speed at which you receive level feelings is influenced by your 
  Wisdom, so if your big, stupid warrior seems to wait forever for 
  level feeling, check out his Wisdom and maybe start with a better one 
  next time. See [j] for more about level feelings.
  
  On Monster Knowledge
  
  In many other games, you are required to take notes on the 
  weaknesses, strengths, spells, etc. of a given monster; but 
  FrogComposband takes these notes for you automatically. Every time 
  you find out something new about a monster (like that it can breathe 
  fire), this is added to your knowledge of the monster. There are 
  several ways to look over this knowledge; you can type '/', then the 
  symbol of the monster (you may have to scroll through other monster 
  memories to get to the one you're looking for); you can use the '~' 
  knowledge menu; or you can use the look ('*') and recall ('r') 
  commands if the monster you are interested in is in view.
  
  In the unpleasant event of your character's death, you can create a 
  new character using your old character's file (instead of simply 
  creating a new character, open the dead character's savefile, and the 
  Creating a Character section will come up). This new character will 
  retain the monster lore of the old one.
  
  On Death
  
  Death in FrogComposband is permanent. Saving is meant only to let you 
  pick up where you left off; if you die, your savefile is marked. The 
  next time you try to use the savefile, you will get the new character 
  dialogue. Ancestors of dead characters will retain their monster 
  memory and preferences. Many people here have characters like "Yuppy 
  XIV"; people die very often and death is common, so don't get 
  discouraged. In general, you will kill monsters more often than they 
  kill you!
  
  I'm still unsure about something...?
  
  Try looking elsewhere in the help, particularly in the Frequently 
  Asked Questions. It's called that for a reason! You can also ask your 
  question at the angband.oook.cz forums or the angband.live online 
  chat; both usually have friendly people willing to share their 
  maxed-out wisdom.

On Big Boy Pants

When you are ready to move past Beginner Mode, the game will open up a 
huge variety of race and class options for you as well as giving you a 
full wilderness to explore. All of this is discussed in the remainder 
of the help system, so when you are ready to move on, be sure to check 
out the rest of the documentation. Pay special attention to sections on 
the wilderness as well as the various gameplay options. And when you're 
ready for a real treat, fire up a game in Monster Mode and play as a 
Cyberdemon!

Good luck, have fun, and don't die! :)
