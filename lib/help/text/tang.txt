The Newbie Guide

Welcome to Oposband! This guide will attempt to give you a quick 
overview of the game and get you started on your path to slay the 
dreaded Serpent of Chaos.

Overview

Oposband is a single player role playing game where you, the brave 
adventurer, attempt to save the world by defeating evil monsters 
including, eventually, the Serpent of Chaos. The road is long, and the 
path is treacherous. Many have tried and failed, and the dungeons are 
littered with the bones of would be heroes. Do you have what it takes 
to succeed where so many others have failed? If so, read on.

Creating a Character

Your first step will be to create your character. You can refer to [a] 
for more detailed info, but the basics are that you will choose a sex, 
a race and a class and then roll for stats. While your sex is not 
important (to the game), your race and class are key to everything that 
follows. Normally, the game has a vast (overwhelming?) array of choices 
that offer myriad, diverse playstyles, and it can take a while to even 
learn what is available. For now, we'll consider a few basic playstyles 
in order to get you going.

The easiest style is 'Hack and Slash' and it is the essence of the 
warrior. Almost any race will make a good one, but you might consider 
trying a High-Elf or a Hobbit. Both are stealthy and have good magic 
skills that will assist the warriors weak points. But if you really 
want to turn on the melee power, nothing beats a Half-Troll. Be warned: 
Trolls are ugly and stupid, not to mention widely hated. Shopkeepers 
are loath to sell to one as ugly as you so you'll have a harder time 
shopping. You can compensate by going on a killing rampage, which is 
more fun anyway. As a warrior, there isn't much strategy: simply find 
monsters and kill them! Look for better armor and weapons. Perhaps you 
can shoot a crossbow for a little bit of distance damage but your 
mainstay will be hand to hand combat. For stats, you'll want to start 
with 17 in both Strength and Dexterity and can ignore everything else.

Another style is to take the stealthy approach and play a rogue. Again, 
Hobbits and High-Elves are good for beginners. You'll want good 
fighting stats (Strength and Dexterity) as before, but this time, you 
also have the ability to cast magic spells. And while magic is not your 
forte, it eventually becomes very useful, so you'll want a decent 
Intelligence as well. (Every spellcaster has a primary stat for 
purposes of casting spells, and you can find this information out by 
reading the various class descriptions during the birth process, or by 
refering to the help files). Now you can't just roll 17 for every stat 
you need, so you'll need to be less greedy. I'd go with 16 for each, or 
perhaps 17 for Str and Dex and 14 for Int. Play around to see what you 
can get from the auto-roller. Also, once you pick your class, you'll 
need to pick a spell realm as well. Try Sorcery or, better yet, 
Burglary. Both have good detection but Burglary is uniquely designed 
for rogues allowing the player to do things like set traps and pick 
pockets. Fun stuff!

Finally, you can play with Magic as your forte as a mage. Gnomes and 
High-Elves are excellent choices here (Some would say that High-Elves 
are a munchkin race!). But magic takes some time to get good with, so I 
don't recommend this right away unless you are a patient person. Pick 
Chaos and then Sorcery for your spell realms and then roll a 17 
Intelligence and a high Strength as well (say 15 or more). You'll need 
the Strength to carry goodies that you find in the dungeon. The Chaos 
realm gives good offense while Sorcery complements that with utility.

We'll discuss these three styles more as we proceed through this guide.

Equipping for Danger

Once you have completed the birth process, you will find yourself in 
the town on the surface. Since you picked Beginner Mode, there will be 
no wilderness to explore. In this case, the only reason to return to 
the surface is to buy and sell equipment in the town. When you start, 
you have some initial gear that varies with your class, and it should 
already be equipped for you. You also have a small amount of gold which 
you can use to augment your supplies for that first trip into danger.

So, what do you see at first?

Well, that @ in the center of the screen is you for starters. Also, 
those # characters are walls and you can see they are shaped into 
buildings for the various shops. Each building has a number or '+' 
character that you may enter by moving onto that square. Each number 
stands for a different type of shop. You can move about with the arrow 
keys and look about with the l command followed by the arrow keys. That 
f is a monster and you should look at it with the l command to see if 
it seems threatening:

The Scrawny cat ('f')/('f'): [r,q,t,p,o,+,-,<dir>]
No battles to the death are recalled.
A skinny little furball with sharp claws and a menacing look.
It lives in the town, and moves a bit erratically at normal speed. Nothing is
known about its attack.

Hmmm, probably no need to worry about Ms. Kitty.

If you are playing a mage, your first order of business is to learn a 
new spell (G to Gain a spell). At first level, you can only learn one, 
so make it count. I recommend learning Magic Missile first, assuming 
you followed my advice and chose the Chaos realm. As a mage, you really 
need to use magic to kill stuff so your first spell has to be something 
offensive. Later on, when you are more experienced, you may pick Detect 
Monsters from the Sorcery realm. To cast a spell, use the magic command 
(m) and follow the instructions. Not every class can learn a spell 
right away, however. A rogue, for example, must reach level 5 (CL5) in 
order to learn their first spell.

Next, you should shop for gear. I recommend buying some means of 
escape, such as scrolls of teleport or phase door from the Alchemy Shop 
(5). Also, you will want some means of healing from the Temple (4). If 
you are playing a rogue, try to buy a sling and some ammo (pebbles or 
shots) from the Weapon Smiths (3). When you enter a store, you will see 
a list of inventory as well as a list of commands to use. Simply follow 
the instructions to make a purchase.

In my case, I bought a sling and some ammo (Each type of missile weapon 
uses a corresponding type of ammo. Obviously, arrows are for bows and 
bolts are for crossbows, so they wouldn't work with my sling!). Now the 
sling is doing me no good in my pack: I need to equip it first in order 
to use it in combat, and I do this with the w command, after which is 
it visible in the equipment list which can be viewed with the e 
command.

Sorry about that, Ms. Kitty! She's not dead yet, but will be shortly. I 
want you to notice a few things. First, as you play the game, notice 
that messages will be displayed in the top region of the screen. Back 
when I was a youngster, the game only had a single message line, and we 
hapless players were plagued with -more- prompts out the wazoo, not to 
mention sore fingers from all the extra keypresses! You may still get a 
-more- from time to time. If you do, simply press SPACE when you are 
finished reading and the next batch of output will be displayed. The 
messages will clear automatically after you enter your next command, so 
make sure you are done reading before pressing any keys. You can always 
review messages with the Previous Messages command (CTRL+P).

Next, on the left hand side of the screen you can see 3 status bars. 
The first one (@[*********]) is for the player's hp. It is full since I 
haven't been hurt yet. The second one (,[*********]) displays my food 
status. I'm not hungry yet, so this one is full as well. Both of these 
are optional (and the food one in particular might not interest you). 
But the third one (f[*--------]) is very important. It tracks your 
current target, or the monster you most recently damaged. In this case, 
it shows me the health of Ms. Kitty, and you can see she is in some 
pretty dire straits.

Finally, notice my shot ({) laying on the ground next to Ms. Kitty. 
Sometimes your missile ammo will break on impact, but if it doesn't 
you'll want to go gather it up after you are done fighting. You can 
pickup objects by moving on top of them and using the get command (g).

Killing cats is fun, but it is time to move on. If you have money left 
over, go to the General Store (1) and buy a lantern and some oil. 
Lanterns cast more light than torches and allow you to see further in 
the dark. Sell your starting torches. Oh, and be sure to equip your 
lantern to actually use it (w to wear an item).

Of course, it's possible that these items will not be available in the 
stores. The stores will "refresh" themselves every so often, getting 
rid of old items and buying new ones. If you ever find that there's 
something you need which the stores don't currently have, you can come 
back a bit later. However, to prevent town scumming, the stores won't 
actually restock unless you do a bit of adventuring first.

Hopefully, you managed all of this without too much trouble from the 
locals (t), but occasionally the townsfolk will interact with you. This 
may be simply annoying, as there are plenty of drunks about, but it can 
also be dangerous as urchins have been known to steal gold and you look 
like an easy mark. You can attack a monster by simply moving into it, 
assuming you have a weapon equipped. If you are playing a mage, you 
should learn your Magic Missile spell first (G allows you to Gain a 
spell) and fight with that instead (m allows you to cast a magic 
spell).

My First Trip Down

The Warrens dungeon, a good place to start, is just east (to the right) 
of the city gates. The > character represents the entrance to a 
dungeon. >, in general refers to stairs down, but dungeon entrances > 
and quest entrances > are color coded to stand out. Similarly, < refers 
to stairs up. By some cosmic accident, these are also the keys you 
press to take the stairs: > to go down and < to go up. What could be 
easier to remember? So move to the stairs down to the Warrens and enter 
the dungeon!

As you walk about, beware of monsters and use the look command (l) 
together with the recall option (r) to get a verbose monster 
description. For example:

                                                                              C

It is about two feet long and has sharp pincers.                                


At this point, you basically explore the current level. You can walk 
back to town at any time by going back up those stairs you just 
descended. You can also find new stairs down to deeper depths. 
Basically, the deeper you go, the more difficult things become, so 
you'll want to take it easy on the stairs at first.

So, walk around a bit and kill stuff. Don't worry too much about dying 
as it will probably happen quite a bit at first. And if it does, the 
next time you load this savefile the birth process will give you an 
extra option to Quick Start this character, which basically skips the 
entire birth process and rolls a character identical to the last one. 
So it's easy to start up again after you die. (See, we streamline the 
common cases :)

So, I will continue to play a bit. You can just sit back and watch! ... 
Oops, I think I'm in trouble:

Notice my 10 hp? Well, if my hp go below 0, I am dead. Also notice the 
very loud *** LOW HITPOINT WARNING! ***? This is to make sure you 
notice when you are in trouble. The game even forces me to press SPACE 
before continuing. Really, I think I am about to die!

             The Novice warrior attacks you: He hits. What a noble sacrifice!

But never fear, I can quickly start over. Notice the new birth option:

  Do you want to use the quick start function(same character as your last one).


          Use quick start? [y/N]

Choosing y immediately recreates a new character with the same race, 
class and stats as the old one and immediately places me back in town. 
This is a brand new character, so any objects I acquired (like that 
sling) are gone, and I have no experience. However, my monster memory 
survives, so I don't have to memorize all the monsters as you encounter 
them.

Go ahead and play a bit. At this point, the tutorial is over and I'll 
just give some basic tidbits about the game.

Tidbits

Every monster uses a unique ASCII character that sort of tells you what 
it is. For example, rats use the letter 'r' while orcs use the letter 
'o'. When you see a character you don't understand, press l to look at 
it. If it is a monster, you can then press r to recall information 
about it, including a description that will give you more information. 
Other characters like '/' and '!' represent objects that you may pick 
up (g to get) and then use.

How you use an object will depend upon its type. Some common examples 
are:

Char  Object         Usage
====  ============== =========================================================
,     Food           E to eat it. Do this whenever you feel hungry.
!     Potion         q to quaff it. Try to identify the potion first.
?     Scroll         r to read it.
?     Spellbook      b to browse it. G to gain a spell. m to cast.
-     Wand           a to aim it.
-     Rod            z to zap it.
_     Staff          u to use it.
~     Lantern        w to wear it. F to refill it with oil.
/     Polearm        w to wield it.
\     Hafted Weapon  w to wield it.
|     Sword          w to wield it.
(     Soft Armor     w to wear it.
[     Hard Armor     w to wear it.
]     Misc. Armor    w to wear it.

If you want to know what a specific symbol stands for, type /, and then 
the symbol. For instance, if you're wondering what all the t's are, 
type /t, and the game will tell you that these are townspeople. You can 
also look at an item, feature, or monster. While looking, pressing 
space or enter will cycle through the different interesting things in 
view. There is also a full map function: type M. It will bring up a map 
of the entire area. Finally, if you type L, you can scroll the 
(full-zoom) map around the dungeon. In general, you can use M to find 
areas that look interesting and L to look at them in detail.

From here on we'll be giving detailed dungeon survival information. 
Some of it is intuitive, and some of it you aren't likely to find out 
without a lot of deaths first. If you want to experience the painful 
learning process in all it's glory, don't read further. If, however, 
you're sick and tired of dying, read ahead.
 
On Weapons and Multiple Blows

Some characters will start the game being able to get multiple blows 
per round with their weapon when attacking. Whether or not you get more 
blows than this later in the game will be determined by your class, 
your weapon weight, your Strength, and your Dexterity. Check your 
Character Sheet (type C):

And then either scroll down to the Melee section, or press m to 
navigate more quickly:

 Hand #1: a Dagger (1d4) (+0,+0)                            Accuracy
 Weight : 1.2 lbs                                            AC Hit
 Profic : Beginner (+0 To Hit)                               25 75%
 To Hit : 0 + 5 = 5                                          50 55%
 To Dam : 0 + 3 = 3                                          75 34%
 Blows  : 2.74                                              100 13%
 Damage                                                     125  5%
 Crits  : 1.00x (0.7%)                                      150  5%
 Normal : 14 (10-19) [1.00x]                                175  5%
                                                            200  5%

In my case, this is a newborn adventurer still using his starting 
dagger. But you'll notice that he is getting multiple blows per round, 
2.74 in this case. What could that possibly mean? Actually, it's rather 
simple: 74% of the time I will get 3 attacks per round while 26% of the 
time, only 2. How is that number determined and what can I do to make 
it bigger? Good questions! The melee calculation is a little 
complicated, but basically it depends on the weapon and how heavy it 
is, your stats and how strong and dextrous you are, and your class. 
Rogues often get extra blows quicker, especially with lighter weapons. 
This is because their class favors light weapons such as daggers, and 
the game encourages this. Most other characters won't start with so 
many attacks. And you'll notice that while I get 2.74 attacks per 
round, my damage is rather pathetic (14 damage per round).

The Weapon Info screen also displays melee accuracy. Of course, you 
won't hit every time you swing. Accuracy depends on you skill with the 
weapon as well as its magical bonuses, if any. It also depends on your 
fighting skill (Shown on the initial Character Sheet above under the 
Skills section for Melee. My Melee skill is 'Excellent' in this case) 
which increases with stats (Strength and Dexterity) as well as 
experience (Level). All of this competes against the monster's armor 
class (AC). Basically, some monsters are harder to hit than others. 
Dragons are notoriously tough skinned, for example.

You may also see detailed information on your missile weapon in your 
character sheet. It is displayed right after the melee section 
(provided you are actually wielding a shooter), and can be quickly 
navigated to by pressing s:

 Shooting: a Sling (x2) (+0,+0)                                                
 Range   : 160'
 Shots   : 1.30
 Mult    : 2.06x
 To Hit  : 0 + 5 = 5
 To Dam  : 0 (Multiplier Applies)
 Xtra Dam: 0 (Multiplier Does Not Apply)

 Ammo #1 : 30 Rounded Pebbles (1d2) (+0,+0) (3/3)                  AC Hit
 Weight  : 0.4 lbs                                                 50 62%
 To Hit  : 0 + 5 = 5                                              100 28%
 To Dam  : 0 + 0 = 0 (Multiplier Applies)                         150  5%
 Damage                                                           175  5%
 Crits   : 1.00x                                                  200  5%
 Normal  : 3 (2-5) [2.06x]

In this case, you see I get multiple shots, but ranged combat works a 
bit differently than melee combat. Rather than taking all of your 
allowed shots in a single round, you take one at a time, but the game 
charges you less than the full amount of energy per shot. I haven't 
explained the speed system yet, but suffice it to say that less energy 
per action means you move faster, and can do more before any nearby 
monsters get a chance to act.

These two screens, Weapon Info and Shooter Info, will become more and 
more useful to you as you play the game. Don't worry if you don't 
understand everything displayed on them at the moment.

On Armor and Resistance

We just saw how monsters have this attribute called armor class, and 
how this makes them harder to hit. Similarly, the player has an armor 
class which is determined by the armor they are currently wearing as 
well as their dexterity. In addition to making you harder to hit, AC 
also actually reduces the damage from certain types of melee attacks, 
so it is a very important attribute that you will want to increase as 
much as possible. If every you find yourself getting destroyed in 
melee, you'll want to look for better AC from your gear.

Here is my Character Screen where you can see my starting AC:

In addition to AC, though, the player has a very important set of 
resistances. Or, in this case, rather a lack of resistances. Scroll 
down to the equipment section of your character sheet, or press e to 
navigate more quickly. Here you get to see, in all its gritty detail, 
how woefully inadequate your starting character actually is. Here is my

You'll notice a group of attributes for resistances and another for 
miscellaneous abilities along with some additional groupings for Slays 
and such. Let's just focus on Resistances for the time being.

So what is resistance and why should you care? Basically, monster 
attacks often have an elemental flavor to them. Their damage has a 
'type'. For example, a fire breathing dragon breathes ... well, fire! 
And your fire resistance helps you withstand that particular type of 
damage. Many damage types also have effects as well. Sticking with our 
fiery example, this type of attack can destroy items in your pack, 
especially scrolls and spellbooks. Your fire resistance helps out here 
as well. Here is a short summary of attack types as well as when you'd 
like to have resistance. Be warned that some monster attacks can be 
very deadly, killing you in a single attack if you are unprepared!

Type       Comment
====       =============================================================
Acid       Destroys scrolls/staves. Damages armor. DL30.
Elec       Destroys rings/wands and reduces Dex. DL30.
Fire       Destroys scrolls/staves/spellbooks. DL20.
Cold       Destroys potions. DL30.
Poison     Known to instantly kill many an adventurer. DL40
Nexus      Scrambles stats and teleports player. Not very damaging.
Confusion  Confuses you so you can't act. DL30.
Paralysis  Freezes the player so you lose turns. Get Free Action by DL30.

My character is not completely hopeless. Being a High-Elf, I begin with 
Light Resistance (30%) and See Invisible. The latter allows me to see 
ghosts and other invisible monsters. Without it, I wouldn't be able to 
see when certain monsters attack me, which can be very annoying, not to 
mention deadly. See Invisible (like Free Action) is one of the required 
abilities that you will want as soon as possible.

And while your race can grant resistances and abilities, most of the 
time these come from your gear. The 'abcd...' list across the top of 
each column corresponds to my current equipment set, and the 
corresponding item character is displayed if an item is actually 
equipped in that slot (e.g. | for my dagger, which is categorized by 
the game as a sword). So you can track your current resistances and 
abilities here as well as see where you are getting a given attribute. 
The '@' character corresponds to the player (displayed as an @, 
remember?) and lists innate racial abilities, as well as temporarily 
acquired magical enhancements (There might be a potion that grants 
temporary resistance, for example).

In general, you will want to cover as many resistances as possible. 
They are not so important early in the game, but as you descend deeper, 
you will learn what you need and when. Abilities are often optional, 
except for Free Action and See Invisible which you will want by DL20 if 
possible. Hold Life starts to become desirable around DL35 or so. You 
can play without it, but it's just to darn annoying!

Also note that resistances stack. If two items grant fire resistance, 
your percentage resistance goes up (but not linearly). Multiple sources 
of a given resistance also help to prevent many of the nasty side 
effects for various damage types.

OK, I cannot help thinking that the starting character sheet is lame, 
since every single attribute is empty. Here is a more interesting 
sample from a Dragon character I am playing (Notice the different body 
type? He is playing in Monster mode where you get to play as a monster 
rather than a normal player):

On Important Magical Items

Magical Items are an important part of every players repertoire, even 
the warrior's. There are seveal types of magic that every player needs.

  Teleporation and Escape
  
  It is very easy to become surrounded, or cut off from a safe retreat. 
  Even the mightiest of warriors can become overwhelmed by sheer 
  numbers. And this doesn't even account for the fact that many 
  monsters can summon other monsters who can themselves summon other 
  monster summoning monsters. Things can go bad in a heart beat, and 
  when it does, you'll want to have a magical means of escape at the 
  ready.
  
  Phase Door     This is a short range teleport that usually won't get 
                 you out of danger. It is useful for distance damage 
                 tactics such as the Shoot 'n Scoot maneuver discussed 
                 below.
  
  Teleport       A longer range escape that is the mainstay of most 
                 retreats. However, this escape is a bit risky as you 
                 may land in a worse situation than you started in.
  
  Teleport Away  This teleports all monsters in a line away, but many 
                 monsters resist and some are immune. It is generally 
                 useful for getting rid of a single troublesome 
                 opponent while preserving your current position. It is 
                 also essential for attempting to clear treasure 
                 vaults.
  
  Teleport Level This is the safest escape, moving you up or down an 
                 entire dungeon level. You abandon the current level 
                 and all of its goodies, although sometimes you can 
                 find your way back through the new level's staircases.
  
  Destruction    This powerful spell removes everything (including 
                 artifacts!) from the area around you, blasting the 
                 surroundings and causing rock to fall from the 
                 ceiling. If you're ever in deep trouble, this is a 
                 good way to escape. However, even Destruction isn't 
                 foolproof: monsters get a saving throw and can avoid 
                 being removed. I recommend saving scrolls of 
                 destruction for the final battle. You will need plenty 
                 to deal with all of the Serpent's summons.
  
  Healing and Recovery
  
  During your adventures, things will hurt you. This cannot be avoided. 
  Fortunately, there are many magical potions that cure your wounds as 
  well as various status ailments like blindness, confusion and poison.
  
  Cure Light Wounds    Restores a small amount of hitpoints, perhaps 10 
                       or so. And while it won't completely cure cuts, 
                       it does reduce their effects (Cuts cause you to 
                       bleed out, losing hitpoints every few turns). It 
                       also cures blindness which is important since 
                       you need to be able to see in order to read a 
                       scroll or cast a spell from your spellbook (Not 
                       to mention see who is attacking you!).
  
  Cure Serious Wounds  Restores a bit more hp, perhaps 20 or so. It 
                       also cures blindness and confusion and reduces 
                       your cut status.
  
  Cure Critical Wounds Even better! It heals about 30 hp and cures most 
                       ailments: blindness, confusion, cuts and stuns 
                       are completely cured. So is poison.
  
  The above three are readily available in the town at the Temple, and 
  you should stock up on them as much as possible. The following must 
  be found in the dungeon or purchased in the Black Market:
  
  Curing    Like Cure Critical Wounds, only better. It heals around 
            50hp and cures every status ailment excluding Fear. Even 
            Hallucination is cured which is often very welcome as the 
            mere sight of certain monsters is enough to trigger this 
            crippling effect.
  
  Healing   Big time hp recovery at about 300hp. Also, most status 
            ailments are cured except for fear and hallucination.
  
  *Healing* Bigger time hp recovery at about 1000hp. Also, most status 
            ailments are cured except for fear and hallucination. These 
            potions are very rare and should be saved for the final two 
            battles.
  
  Life      Restores your stats, all your hp and removes all status 
            ailments except Fear. These potions are so rare, they 
            should be saved for the final battle.
  
  Knowledge
  
  When you find a new object, you generally won't know anything about 
  it. In order to learn about the objects you find, you need some means 
  of knowledge. Every player has an innate sense about some of the 
  objects they find and simply carrying the object around in your pack 
  for a while can give you a clue as to its worth. This ability is 
  called pseudo-id and is discussed elsewhere in the documentation. In 
  general, it only works on equipment such as weapons and armor, 
  although certain classes like Mages can sense the worth of rings and 
  amulets. I mention pseudo-id since it is your most important means of 
  knowledge in the early game. You can also learn what some objects are 
  by trying them out. For example, you can eat a newly found mushroom, 
  or quaff that new potion in your pack. However, if you try this, 
  you'll quickly learn it is a bad idea for mushrooms and potions. For 
  magical devices like wands, rods and staves, it is acceptable to try 
  them as you find them. But once you have Identify, you'll want to use 
  that instead.
  
  Later on, you'll want to improve your means of knowledge and there 
  are two steps in this process (after pseudo-id). The first is called 
  Identify and the second is called *Identify*. The first gives cursory 
  knowledge of an object, revealing its full name and magical combat 
  bonuses or AC bonuses. For potions and scrolls it reveals the name of 
  the object which is often enough for you to tell whether or not it is 
  useful (And once you learn a given flavor of potion, scroll or 
  mushroom, you will automatically recognize the next one you find. So 
  identifying 'flavors' is important in the early game. By the way, you 
  can also sell an object to *Identify* it, but then you won't have it 
  anymore! Still, it's something to consider for the early game when 
  most stuff is junk anyway). The second means of enhanced knowledge, 
  *Identify*, gives complete information about the object, including 
  all of its powers and resistances, many of which won't be learned by 
  simply Identifying the object. Both Identify and *Identify* are 
  available in scroll and device form. Both are also available as a 
  town service (for a price). In general, you'll want to carry lots of 
  Identify to weed out the junk while exploring the dungeon. Once you 
  return to town, you can then pay to *Identify* whatever needs it.
  
  In addition to Identifying objects, you also need to map the dungeon, 
  detect traps, detect monsters and learn about unfamiliar monsters, 
  especially uniques. There are magic items for all of these, so be on 
  the lookout!
  
  Travel
  
  Finally, you don't need to climb up and down the stairs all the time 
  to return to town. There is a magic item called Word of Recall 
  (scrolls) or just Recall (devices) that will take you back and forth 
  between the town and your current dungeon level. And this is a good 
  thing too since it would be rather onerous to walk up and down 100 
  flights of stairs in the end game!
  
On Weapons, Armor and Slays

Potions, Scrolls and devices are not the only magical items around. You 
can also find magical armor and equipment. We already discussed 
resistances above, and magical equipment is the usual place to find 
these attributes. Magical weapons often are more deadly against certain 
enemies, an attribute known as slays.

Your equipment will always carry around little numbers that tell you 
how effective it is. Armors take this form:

  A Robe (+x,+y) [a,+b] (+c)

Weapons take this form:

  A Long Sword (XdY) (+x,+y) [+b] (+c)

When unidentified, armors will show just this:

  A Robe [a]

Weapons will show this:

  A Long Sword (XdY)

What do all these numbers mean?

(+x,+y) This is the item's magical bonuses to your to-hit and to-damage 
        bonus respectively. These are added to whatever other bonuses 
        you have when you attack. Some armors have similar bonuses to 
        your to-hit and to-damage, but they are mostly artifacts, the 
        exceptions being Gloves/Gauntlets/Cesti of Slaying. Many body 
        armors have a small negative number before the base armor bonus 
        (see below); this is a penalty to your skill (the armor is so 
        heavy that you have trouble moving around in it). However, this 
        penalty is small enough for all but the youngest of characters 
        to ignore.

[a,+b]  This is the item's base armor class and magical bonus to armor. 
        The higher, the better. While theoretically, a weapon could 
        provide a base armor bonus, none of them do, and only a few 
        weapons have a magical bonus to armor.

(+c)    This is the item's magical bonus to other statistics (and is 
        sometimes referred to as its pval). Possibilities include one 
        or more of your stats (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, 
        Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma), your speed or your stealth. 
        Your searching or infravision might also be improved. There are 
        other possibilities and learning the effects of this bonus 
        often requires you to *Identify* the object.

(XdY)   This is the damage dice of a melee weapon. When you hit an 
        opponent, the game rolls a Y sided die X times to figure out a 
        base damage. This base damage can be multiplied by any slays on 
        the weapon, and also by critical hits (lucky blows on your 
        part). Then, the game adds all the plusses to damage to the 
        total, including the +y from the (+x,+y) discussed above. So a 
        melee weapon can be good because it has good damage dice (e.g. 
        (5d6) (+0,+0)) or because it has a high damage bonus (e.g. 
        (1d5) (+5,+30)). Ideally, it would have both: (5d6) (+5,+30)!

In addition to these attributes, all of which are revealed by Identify, 
weapons and armors may have additional bonuses. Both may grant a 
particular resistance that we discussed earlier. In additions, weapons 
often have slays that target a specific class of monster. Slays work by 
multiplying the base damage roll (The (XdY) just discussed), and the 
multiplier varies with the type of slay. For example, a weapon of Slay 
Orc multiplies the damage dice by a factor of 3, while a *Slay Orc* 
weapon might (I say, might!) multiply by as high a factor as 5. 
Obviously, this means more on a (5d6) weapon than on a (1d5) weapon, so 
the quality of a magical weapon depends heavily on the base type of the 
object (Daggers do 1d5 while Blades of Chaos do 5d6). You sometimes 
need to *Identify* a weapon to learn its slays. But sometimes it is 
obvious from the name of the object (Slay Orc) and you only need to 
Identify the weapon. Artifacts always required *Identify* to learn 
their attributes.

On Dungeon Exploration

We'll close this Newbie guide with some various tips on exploring the 
dungeon.

  On Secret Doors
  
  Throughout the dungeon, many doors are hidden from view. To find 
  them, use the (S)earch command, which toggles on and off the 
  Searching mode. However, it is often difficult enough just knowing 
  where to search. Usually, situations like this will have secret doors 
  (walls containing secret doors are marked by *s):
   
  #*###  ###'###  ####*#    ###*###
  *@...  ..'@'..  ..@'.*    ..'@...
  #*###  ###*###  ####'#    #######
   
  In general, if you see a door by itself in a corridor, there are 
  usually others nearby. If you find a corner in a corridor with two 
  doors, look for more. Intersections often have some secret doors. 
  Finally, secret doors will never be in a situation where you have to 
  move diagonally to open them. The dead-end situation (the first one) 
  usually does have a secret door, but not always. If you search for a 
  while and don't find anything, just give up and move on. Sometimes a 
  dead end will occur near the end of a map, where there is no room to 
  have a continuing corridor, and so no secret door is generated.
  
  On Level Feelings
  
  After you have been on a new level for a considerable length of time, 
  you receive a feeling giving you a vague idea how good the level is. 
  In general, the more scary the feeling sounds, the better the items 
  on the level, or the more difficult the monsters. Probably the 
  latter. Each unusual item or monster bumps up the rating of the level 
  a bit. An item or monster is considered unusual if it is out of depth 
  [normally occurs at a lower depth; for instance, a Longsword has a 
  base level of 20, and would be considered unusual anywhere above that 
  level (although not below it)]. Items can be out of depth without 
  necessarily being anything special; a normal, non-magical katana 
  could provoke a high level feeling at low depths, because it is so 
  unusual. Also, pits (large rooms filled with a single type of 
  monster) and vaults (dense, dangerous rooms with many out of depth 
  monsters and items) can cause high level feelings. There is also a 
  Special feeling which tells the player that there is an artifact on 
  the level.
  
  The speed at which you receive level feelings is influenced by your 
  Wisdom, so if your big, stupid warrior seems to wait forever for 
  level feeling, check out his Wisdom and maybe roll up a better one 
  next time.
  
  On the Monster Memory
  
  In many other games, you are required to take notes on monster's 
  weaknesses, strengths, spells, etc. However, we are not so cruel as 
  that, and will automatically take notes for you with the handy 
  Monster Memory. Every time you find out something new about a 
  monster, like that it can breathe fire, this is added to your 
  knowledge of the monster. To look over this knowledge, type /, then 
  the symbol of the monster. You may have to scroll through other 
  monster memories to get to the one you're looking for. Or use the 
  look ('l') and recall ('r') commands the next time you see one.
  
  In the unpleasant event of your character's death, you can create a 
  new character using your old character's file (instead of simply 
  creating a new character, open the dead character's savefile, and the 
  Creating a Character section will come up). This new character will 
  have all of the old one's monster memories, and some special text for 
  the monster that killed him.
  
  On Death
  
  Death in Oposband is permanent. Saving is meant only to let you pick 
  up where you left off; if you die, your savefile is marked. The next 
  time you try to use the savefile, you will get the new character 
  dialogue. Ancestors of dead characters will retain their preferences. 
  Many people here have characters like "Yuppy XIV"; people die very 
  often and death is common, so don't get discouraged. In general, you 
  will kill monsters more often than they kill you!
  

Have Fun! :)
