General Information

This document gives a brief introduction to the game. You will probably 
want to browse through all the help files, especially the sections on 
available commands (see [a] and [b]), before beginning any serious 
adventuring. There is also a Newbie guide (see [c]) and I'll leave it 
you to decide if that is the best place to start reading. (Aside: 
Whenever you see a letter in square brackets, that is a link to another 
place in the documentation. Press that letter to follow the link, and 
escape to return back to where you were in this document. Go ahead and 
try it now! You can also press ? for help on the help system itself.)

The game is a single player dungeon simulation. A player may choose 
from a number of races, classes and magic realms when creating a 
character (see [d]), and then "run" that character over a period of 
days, weeks, even months. Deep down inside, the real objective of the 
game is to increase your experience, and certain other characteristics, 
and also to collect useful items, to give you a decent chance of 
defeating the final monster. Depending upon which world sequence you 
are playing, this is either Morgoth, Lord of Darkness or The Serpent of 
Chaos.

Eventually, the game will support multiple "modules" and the player 
will select which module to play during the birth sequence. The Middle 
Earth module is currently the only one, but a World of Amber will 
probably arrive soon. Each module defines a sequence of worlds for the 
player to explore. Each world has a surface wilderness with one or more 
towns as well as multiple dungeons. Each dungeon has one or more 
guardians: sometimes there is an initial guardian on the first level 
but there is always a guardian on the final level. One of these final 
guardians is also the "world guardian": defeat it an you either move on 
to the next world, or you win the game! For example, in Middle Earth, 
the first world is The Desolation of Smaug, and you must kill this 
dragon before moving on to the next world (The Betrayal of Sarmuan).

The game also offers a few different ways to play. First, there is a 
Beginner Mode that limits the number of races and classes available. 
Playing in beginner mode is designed to simplify the birth process and 
get you playing as soon as possible so that you may more quickly learn 
the game. Eventually, you will want to upgrade to Normal Mode, the 
usual and expected way to play. This mode offers the full repertoire of 
racial and class choices. Prepare to be overwhelmed! Also, as you read 
the help files, you will find that most of the documentation is written 
for this mode. Finally, you may decide you are tired of playing the 
game as a normal player, constantly dying to myriad powerful monsters, 
and decide to play as a monster yourself in Monster Mode. With this 
style, you can pick one of many types of monsters to play and will 
evolve into more powerful forms as you gain experience. Many monsters 
have unique body types so the equipment game will prove interesting. 
Most also have some forms of innate attacks and may not be able to 
wield weapons at all (e.g. Dragons can claw and bite, but it would be 
funny to see one wielding a sword). Truly, there is much to try!

First Place to Go

The player will begin his adventure in town where he may acquire 
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various 
shop owners. You will have some gear as a birthright, and a little bit 
of gold as well. I recommend buying some scrolls of teleport and 
potions of cure light wounds (or serious wounds if you are rich) before 
beginning to play. It is very easy to get in over your head, especially 
early on, so having a ready means of escape is essential. If you have 
gold left over, consider upgrading your starting torch to a lantern, 
which casts more light and allows you to see further in the dark.

You are now ready to descend into the dungeon where fantastic 
adventures await! The first dungeon to explore is The Stronghold, a 
small dungeon whose entrance is located near the starting town. Use the 
] or the M commands to locate the entrance. Like many of the dungeons, 
this one has a boss: some king or other of the Southerings. He's 
reasonably tough for his level, but this is mostly due to his vast host 
readied about him. He has many more friends at the ready as well, so 
you won't want to face him in the open.

Update: As you are exploring this dungeon, you might wonder something: 
How do I get back to the surface? Well, you can walk back up stairs of 
course, but this will eventually become tiresome. Fortunately, you will 
begin finding Wizard Tiles on many (but not all) dungeon levels, 
starting at about 200' (DL4). These tiles are located in special rooms, 
often under some sort of monster guard, and unless you are wizard 
yourself, they are your only means of recalling back to the surface 
(There are no longer Word of Recall scrolls, but a few magic realms 
offer the spell). Some towns will have a Wizard Tile for free travel 
back to the depths, but most will offer a town service and charge you a 
fee.

Once you have completed The Stronghold, you should be ready to set out 
into the wild, the subject of the next section.

Wilderness

Your adventures take place in a dangerous wilderness. Fortunately, you 
begin your journey in the relative safety of the town. But beware, even 
inside the town walls the wilderness is not far off. Dangerous monsters 
do occasionally wander into the town!

When you are ready to begin exploring the wilderness, you will need 
ample supplies of light and food. 

Update: The game no longer has a special wilderness travel mode, so 
wilderness exploration is just like dungeon exploration. Also, the 
wilderness map is no longer revealed to the player, but must be learned 
through actual exploration (Eventually, some sort of random wilderness 
generator will be available as a birth option). Fortunately, there are 
usually roads available leading out of town, and you can travel along 
those to locate additional towns or dungeon entrances. As a tip, using 
the run command will keep the player on the road if you do it right: 
Starting on a "road tile" initiate running in the direction of the next 
road tile, and you will travel quickly and automatically, stopping only 
under monster assault or ambiguity in the road tile sequence (which 
sometimes happens at bends in the road). For example, SHIFT+6 will 
follow the (yellow-brick) road out of town in this scenario:
:#:.:#:#::..::.:.#.####.:..
#######...:...:.:#:#:..#.:.
######+.:#.:......###.:.:#.
########:#:..:..#.##.##.::.
#:###:::#####:#::.###::::##
:#::#:######:####:###:....:
......5#####:::.::.::#.##:#
.:..:#######:......:::.#:..
::#.::##:::#..............:
:::.:.:#::##:@.............
:#:.:.#:#####..............
#.#.....9####..............
.#..##:######::::..........
..###.::##.#:#:.::.::.#::.:


As you travel, you may "stumble on to something interesting," which 
indicates a dungeon entrance. Use the M command to locate the entrance 
(You can also travel to the stairs with ] followed by ` once you select 
the stairs). Some entrances will require Levitation to reach, 
especially in mountainous terrain, so you might wish to acquire this 
ability before setting out on your journeys (Visit The Magic Shop).

Each dungeon in the wilderness has a starting level which is shown to 
you when prompted if you really wish to enter. Think of this as a 
difficulty level, and indeed, many of the dungeons are quite difficult 
if you wander into them unprepared, so be careful!

Winning The Game

Update: The Middle Earth module consists of a sequence of worlds, each 
of which contains a specific monster to kill. The first world is The 
Desolation of Smaug and you must eventually journey to The Lonely 
Mountain to defeat this foe. Upon success, a special Travel Portal will 
be generated allowing you to journey to the next world to continue your 
quest (Tip: You don't need to take the Travel Portal right away. You 
can always return to the sight of your triumph later on. Also, the 
contents of your Home will follow you to the next world). Eventually, 
if you defeat Morgoth, Lord of Darkness in The Depths of Mordor you 
will win the game, but that is a long ways off so don't expect to win 
right away. You will need to learn how to play well in order to 
succeed, and this may take many deaths to achieve. So set your sights 
lower and focus on having fun instead!

Update: As of this writing, the Middle Earth module is the only 
available option, so you aren't even prompted during your character's 
birth. I do plan a World of Amber module that will have The Serpent of 
Chaos as the "win monster." Stay tuned!

Upon Death and Dying

If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died and cannot be 
restored. You can write a last word for posting on the Internet after 
which time, a tombstone showing information about your character will 
be displayed. You are also permitted to get a record of your character, 
and all your equipment (identified) either on the screen or in a file.

Update: The game now automatically keeps a character dump for each of 
your players. You can view your own personal high score ladder using 
the ~H command.

Whether your character is killed or you retire victorious, it will 
leave behind a reduced save file, which contains any Lore your player 
has learned, such as information about various monsters and objects. 
Personally, I prefer to reset my Lore information for every game, so I 
never re-use existing savefiles.

And don't get discouraged! Dying is very common and makes victory, when 
it comes at long last, all the more sweet. It may take months to win 
the game, perhaps even years. But there is fun in the journey, and much 
to try along the way. Enjoy!
