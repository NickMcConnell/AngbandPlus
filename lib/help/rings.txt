<style:heading>Getting Started</style>

Lacking any direct melee attacks and any means of movement, the ring's first order of business is to lure a suitable <color:keyword>ring-bearer</color>. To achieve this, there are two approaches. First, the most powerful means, and the one available to the ring at the very start of their adventuring is to lie still and look enticing! This is the essence of mimicry, and monsters will generally take you for a normal ring unless you do something to reveal your true nature (such as launching a magic missile or otherwise damaging a visible monster). The second means of acquiring a ring-bearer only comes later in the game, and should only be used once a monster has perceived the ring for what it truly is: a sentient and malicious magical creature, out to dominate its wielder.

So the initial approach is to lure a potential ring-bearer and hope they pick the ring up; but what if there are no suitable monsters about? Here, the ring possesses a very special power called <color:keyword>Glitter</color> (available through the <color:keypress>U</color>/<color:keypress>O</color> key). This power is much like resting: the ring simply waits until a monster comes near; however, potential ring-bearers will sense you glittering and approach you out of curiosity. So don't worry: simply lie still and be patient, and monsters will come to you!

Once a suitable ring-bearer approaches, you will want to lie still and trick it into picking you up and wearing you. Only then will it realize its mistake but by that time, it is too late! Of course, the ring-bearer might recognize you for what you are when it gets close, at which point it will attack you, so this approach is not without risk; but if you succeed in being worn, the ring-bearer becomes your pet, and is controlled by your will. Now, at last, you may move about!

The other order of business for the ring upon starting the game is to acquire magical spells by <color:keyword>absorbing</color> suitable jewelry (rings or amulets). Since these are rare in the early going, the ring is actually born with a couple of fine trinkets. You should absorb these at once to gain a couple of minor powers that will assist you in the early going. (See <link:rings.txt#Absorption> below for more details.)

<style:heading>Acquiring and Keeping Your Bearer</style>

Glittering has a couple of downsides that limit its usefulness. Firstly, you need to look nice and innocent, so being on somebody else's finger won't do; if you already have a bearer, you need to dismiss them or at least slip off their finger. Secondly, you only get one attempt at fooling a monster; if he sees through you, he'll attack you... just when you are at your most vulnerable due to having no ring-bearer. Thirdly, even if you successfully fool a monster into picking you up, it might not be a monster you're happy with!

There is another way to acquire ring-bearers, though it only becomes available some way into the game: you can <color:keyword>charm</color> any suitable monster. The Charming power, like Glitter and Absorb, is used through the <color:keypress>U</color> command (<color:keypress>O</color> in the roguelike keyset). Charming is not very reliable, but unlike glittering, if you fail you can (usually) try again.

Having successfully charmed your target, use the <color:keypress>p</color> pet commands to make them your new ring-bearer: <color:U>get off a pet</color> to leave the previous bearer, <color:U>stay close</color> to encourage the new bearer to approach and finally <color:U>ride a pet</color> when they are adjacent.

Both approaches to acquiring a ring-bearer rely on the ring's <color:keyword>charisma</color> for success. Next to intelligence (which is your spellcasting stat), charisma is the most important stat to a ring; so be sure to invest points in both INT and CHR at birth.

A final point to mention is that your hold on a ring-bearer is not all-powerful. Occasionally, the bearer might cast you off, hurl you on the ground, and begin attacking you! Again, the ring needs a strong force of personality (i.e., Charisma) to maintain its dominance. Should this fail, you can try to recharm the bearer; but sometimes a soured ring-bearer simply needs to be put down, at which point the ring may glitter patiently to lure a new bearer.

<topic:Absorbing><style:heading>Getting Powers and Growing Stronger</style>

Rings have a normal inventory, but cannot wear any equipment. Instead, they gain abilities and spells by absorbing any jewelry (rings or amulets) that they find. A list of your absorbed magical spells and essences, their effects, and their powers is displayed on your character sheet (<color:keypress>C</color>), as well as in the Knowledge Menu's Extra Character Info section (<color:keypress>~x</color>).

To absorb jewelry, you can use the <color:keypress>U</color> command (roguelike <color:keypress>O</color>); but for ergonomic reasons, absorbing also happens automatically when you destroy a ring or an amulet.

Getting powerful spells is difficult, and the ultimate powers may prove elusive; however, with a suitably strong ring-bearer, ultimate success should be possible.

<style:heading>Acceptable Ring-Bearers</style>

Not all monsters are suitable ring-bearers. Bearer candidates include all humans (p), humanoids (h), townspeople (t), angels (A) and yeeks (y), most vampires (V) and liches (L), and a few other thematically suitable monsters such as the Nazgul. The <color:keyword>Charm Ring-Bearer</color> power only works on these monsters; and even if you still acquire other monsters as pets, you cannot ride them or make them pick you up.
