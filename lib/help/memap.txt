=================== "Map" of (northern) Middle Earth =======================

Below is a rough diagram of the linkages between the regions of Middle Earth
your character can visit.  Dungeons' depths are shown in brackets under 
the region where the entrance lies.  Note that some wilderness areas have
no dungeon underneath, but still have a guardian (usually a unique monster), 
who may or may not block passage to another region.  Only passages 
that are never blocked are shown on the map.  This is why only (most of) 
northern Middle Earth is shown --- to get south to where the fate calls, 
you need to fight your way through.

Some towns of Middle Earth are widely known and these are marked by '*' 
on the map; the others are for you to discover --- or perhaps help rebuild?  
The regions change as you shape the fate of Middle Earth by your brave deeds;  
only the initial situation is shown on this map.  Some passages are initially 
one-way only; they are marked with an arrow.  For more information 
about wilderness and dungeons, see "dungeon.txt".
