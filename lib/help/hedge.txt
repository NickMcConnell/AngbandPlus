Hedge Magic
===========

Hedge magic is the least powerful of all the types of magic. However, it
is also the easiest to learn which makes it ideally suited to the part-
time magician. The power of hedge magic comes from charms - natural
items that contain some power. The hedge magician draws the power from
these items and forms it into cantrips. Usually, many cantrips can be
cast from a single item. However, occasionally the power leaks out from
an item and it crumbles to useless dust. A miscast cantrip will always
destroy its charm, so the wise hedge magician will always carry spares.
The best way to avoid such miscasts is to have a high intelligence.

Requirements
============

Obviously, to cast a cantrip the appropriate charm must be available.
The caster must also be able to see the charm and not be confused. Hedge
magic can be learned from practice and individual cantrips do not need
to be learned separately.

Usage
=====

You can use cantrips at any time except when in a shop, in the dark
without a light source, blind or confused. Press the 'h' key to use a
charm (control-W in the roguelike keyset), then select the charm and
select which cantrip you wish to cast from the charm.

Abilities
=========

each one provides a different type of cantrip. The cantrips for each
