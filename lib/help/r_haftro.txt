#####R=== Trolls ===

#####GDescription
Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than any other
character race. They are also very stupid and slow. They make great 
warriors and iffy priests. They are bad at searching, disarming, 
perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that a Orc grimaces in 
their presence. They also happen to be fun to play... trolls always 
have their strength sustained. At higher levels, Trolls learn to 
enter a berserk fury, and regenerate wounds automatically.
