=== Creating a Character ===

Angband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a character
in the world of Angband.  Perhaps the most important thing you control is the
birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be chosen various
attributes that will affect the future life of your character.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of choices
as to constraints on the type of character you wish to play, followed by
a series of random calculations to generate ("roll up") a random character
matching the appropriate constraints.

Once your character has been generated, you will be given the choice to
generate a new character obeying the same constraints, and once you have
generated more than one character, you can switch back and forth between
the two most recent characters, until you are presented with a personality
that you feel comfortable with.

You may start the entire process over at any time.

Once you have accepted a character you will asked to provide a name for the
character.  In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself.  For example,
on some machines, the character name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk.  On others, the character name specifies
special "pref" files.  And the character name is used on the high score list.


=== Character Characteristics ===

Each character has three primary attributes, sex, race, and class, that
are chosen before the character is generated, and which will stay fixed
for the entire life of that character.  These attributes have many effects,
which will be mentioned as they come up.

Each character has a few secondary attributes, height, weight, social class,
and background history, which are randomly determined, but which are affected
by the sex and race of the character.  In general, these attributes are only
used to provide "flavor" to the character, to assist in the role playing, but
they do have a few minor effects on the game.  For example, background history
affects social class, which affects the starting money. (Not a lot, in the case
of some races: for instance, Half-Trolls are always going to be the scum of 
society, even if their father was the Clan Chief.) 

Each character also has six primary "stats", strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the abilities of the
character in a variety of ways.  Every stat has a numerical value, ranging
from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even higher, into
the "percentile" range, represented as "18/01" through "18/100": this is the
maximum that can be achieved intrinsically, for any given stat. If the 
character is started with the option of "maximize effect of race/class 
bonuses" (from the Birth Options menu, and this is set as "on" by default), 
the maximum figure of 18/100 is further adjusted by the adjustments for 
race and class - for instance, a Half-Troll Warrior will max out at 18/190 
strength, but only 18/40 intelligence, whereas a Hobbit Mage will be able 
to reach 18/150 intelligence but only 18/30 strength. Equipment may add 
bonuses or penalties to this, and raise the player's stats beyond the normal
intrinsic limits: the stats may go as high as they like, with the right choice
of equipment, but the effects of having higher stats largely stop at 18/200.

Each character also has several primary "skills", disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, searching frequency, fighting skill,
and shooting skill, which are derived from the character's race, class, level,
stats, and current equipment.  These skills have rather obvious effects, but
will be described more completely below.

Each character may have one or more "racially intrinsic skills", based on
the race of the character.  These may include special resistances, or even
abilities such as infravision.

Each character has experience, which increases as the character becomes more
experienced, and a level, which is based on experience, and also on race and
class.  As the experience rises, so does the level, and as the level rises,
certain other abilities and characteristics rise as well.  Deep down inside,
the real objective of the game is to increase your experience, and certain
other characteristics, and also to collect useful items, to give you a decent
chance against Morgoth.  Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and
thus your level, which will cause you to lose all of the effects of the higher
level.  Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical means, or
by simply regaining the experience all over again.

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it hidden in
the dungeon.  Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which
is based on the characters social class (higher is better), charisma (higher
is better), and other stats (less powerful characters start with more gold).  
Each character also starts out with a few useful items, which may be kept, 
or sold to a shop-keeper for more gold. However, especially valuable items
will never sell for the full price, as each shopkeeper has a maximum that 
he is prepared to pay for any item. The more generous shopkeepers may buy 
your items for up to 30,000 gold pieces: but some are really stingy, and 
will pay no more than 5,000.

Each character has an armor class, representing how well the character can
avoid damage.  The armor class is affected by dexterity and the equipment. 
Armor class on equipment is always denoted in [square brackets], usually as 
a figure of [X,+Y] where X is the intrinsic AC of the armor in question, and 
Y is the magical bonus to armor class provided by that item.

Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the character can
sustain before he dies.  How many hit points a character has is determined by
race, class, level and constitution, as follows:  each race has a basic "hit
dice" number - for instance, a Dwarf's basic hit die is 11, while a hobbit's is 
7. This is modified by class: for instance, a warrior gets a +9 bonus to the 
hit die, while a mage gets no bonus and a priest +2, so a dwarven warrior's 
total hit die will be (11+9)=20 - meaning that he gets between 1 and 20 hit 
points per level. If he were a priest, his hit dice would be (11+2)=13, and get
between 1 and 13 hit points per level. The hobbit mage would get only 1-7 hps
per level. (All characters get the maximum at first level: thereafter it is 
a random roll of 1dX where X is the hit die number, when the character goes up
in level.) This is further modified by constitution - a character with high 
constitution will get a flat bonus of a certain number of hit points per level
(recalculated right back to level 1: if you gain an extra hit point per level, 
and you are 42nd level, you will suddenly be 42 hit points better off.)

Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how many spells
(or prayers) a character can cast (or pray).  The maximum number of spell
points is derived from your class, level, and intelligence (for spells) or
wisdom (for prayers), and you can never have more spell points than the
maximum.  Spell points may be regained by resting, or by magical means.
Warriors never have any spell points.  If a character gains enough wisdom or
intelligence to get more spell points, the result is calculated right back to
first level, just as with constitution and hit points.
