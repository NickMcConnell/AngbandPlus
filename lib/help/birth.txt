<topic:CreateAt><style:title>Creating a Character</style>

FrogComposband is a role-playing game in which you - the player - control a character in a dangerous world of myth and magic, populated with demons, dragons, deities, ducks and other rare and strange creatures of the Last Days. The most important decision you make on your quest to slay the <color:keyword>Serpent of Chaos</color> is what kind of character to play: spell-wielding magician or sword-waving warrior? Stealthy rogue or musical bard? Holy priest or evil spawn of chaos? The choices are myriad, and the process of generating a new character is described in this help file, which will also serve to introduce you to many of the core concepts of the game.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of choices. You must choose your character's race (<color:keyword>Human</color>, <color:keyword>Dwarf</color>, <color:keyword>Hobbit</color>, <color:keyword>Ogre</color>, <color:keyword>Vampire</color>, <color:keyword>Werewolf</color>, etc), your character's class (<color:keyword>Warrior</color>, <color:keyword>Mage</color>, <color:keyword>Priest</color>, <color:keyword>Lawyer</color>, etc) and your character's personality (<color:keyword>Mighty</color>, <color:keyword>Shrewd</color>, <color:keyword>Chaotic</color>, <color:keyword>Split</color>, etc). Each of these choices is described in the help files (see <link:raceclass_contents.txt>).

There are three main screens for the birth process. The first is a brief welcome screen in which you select the type of game to play (the <color:keyword>Game Mode</color>). The next screen allows you to select or change your race, class, gender, personality and character's name. The final screen allows you to enter your starting stats. We will describe each of these screens in detail, explaining things as we go. Ready?

<topic:Welcome><style:heading>The Welcome Screen</style>
The first screen is the Welcome Screen. It simply introduces you to the game and allows you to choose one of several options that will control the birth process. It looks something like this:
<style:screenshot>  <indent>
Welcome to <color:R>FrogComposband</color>, a dungeon exploration role-playing game.
Your goal is to defeat the dreaded <color:R>Serpent of Chaos</color>, but before you can         
face it, you must battle many foes. Your first step is to create a              
character for this quest. The following screens will guide you through          
this process so that you may quickly begin playing. You can get general         
help at any time by pressing <color:o>?</color>.                                                 
                                                                                
First, you must decide what type of game to play. <color:R>Beginner Mode</color> limits
the options available, simplifying things for new players.

<color:G>Tip:</color> You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter           
     for a command. For example, type <color:o>B</color> on this screen to receive help          
     on Beginner Mode.                                                          
</indent></style>

If you are new to the game, consider the <color:keyword>Beginner</color> mode. With this option, you won't be so overwhelmed with choices as is normally the case, allowing you to breeze through the birth process and quickly begin playing (and enjoying) this game. Once you have played a few times and wish to experience more of what the game has to offer, including a vast wilderness with many diverse dungeons to explore and the full array of race, class and personality choices, then you should choose the <color:keyword>Normal</color> mode.

If you are truly bold you can experiment with the <color:keyword>Monster</color> option, which allows you to play as one of many different types of monster. Monsters don't have a class, but instead evolve into more powerful forms as they gain experience. They also tend to have variable body types, making the equipment sub-game both more fun and more challenging.

Also on this screen may be an option to <color:keyword>Quick Start</color>. This option simply repeats the birth selections of your previous character, who presumably just met an untimely demise. This is a useful option if you are dying often in the early game, as it greatly speeds up the birth process.

<topic:RaceClass><style:heading>The Race/Class Screen</style>
On this screen, you can change your race, your class and (unless you picked Beginner Mode) your personality. The screen will look something like the following:

</indent></style>
So, what do we see? First, the fields in <color:B>blue</color> are those that you may change on this screen. Default selections are already in (and sane enough to play with), but you probably want to change them and make your own picks. Your sex is essentially just flavor, and has almost no game-play effects (choices are limited to simply Male and Female, but at least the game is progressive enough to provide ways to swap between those during play!). The other selections you can make are much more important, though: your <color:keyword>race</color>, <color:keyword>class</color>, <color:keyword>personality</color>, and <color:keyword>magic realms</color> (if any) will form the key to your character.

To the right is a table displaying information about the stat bonuses and other modifiers you would receive from your current race, class and personality choices. Every character has six basic attributes, called <color:keyword>stats</color>, that are very important to game play; finding ways to increase your stats will be one of your main practical goals during the game. The six basic stats are: Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON) and Charisma (CHR); see <link:birth.txt#PrimaryStats> below for more detailed information. Your character's spell stat, if any, is displayed in <color:v>violet</color>; this is a very important stat for magical classes, since it determines how well the character can cast spells, and normally you want it to be as high as possible.

On the next screen, you will choose the starting stats for this character, and the values you choose will be modified by the amount shown in the table. The bottom row in the table is the total row, showing you a nice summary of the cumulative effects of your various birth choices. It is the value in this row that gets added to your starting stats.

Other fields in the table include:
  <color:keyword>Life</color>: <indent>Life Multiplier. This value multiplies your maximum hit points (HP). Hit points are your character's health; if your hit points go below zero, you die and the game is over! See <link:faq.txt#LifeRating> for more on how your maximum hit points are calculated.</indent>
  <color:keyword>BHP</color>:  <indent>Short for Base Hit Points, this value is a lump sum added to your starting hit points to make the early game easier.</indent>
  <color:keyword>Exp</color>:  <indent>Short for Experience Factor, this percentage determines how quickly or slowly your character gains new levels. (All players begin at level 1, and may advance up to level 50. Increasing your level gives more hit points, improves your skills, gives access to more powerful spells, and may also provide other effects or bonuses.)</indent>

In addition to stats, your player also has skills (see <link:birth.txt#PrimarySkills> below). For example, your Melee skill determines your ability to hit monsters in hand to hand combat. Like stats, these skills are also affected by your birth options, and are displayed in the information table on this and the next screen; but, since your screen is only so wide, you'll need to use the <color:keypress>TAB</color> key:

Ah, we see that hobbits aren't so good at melee. However, the class choice of Rogue more than makes up for this, and we can tell from the summary line that this character's melee skill will be pretty good. It is a general rule that class influences skills more than race and personality do, especially later in the game (as you gain levels, you also gain skill bonuses, but mostly through your class). The main exception to this rule is Stealth, where the bonuses tend to be zero.

Below the player fields and the information table is a list of commands that you may choose. These commands might bring up a menu of choices for you to select from, as, for example, the Change Race command:

Changing the <color:keyword>game speed</color> does not affect your character directly; rather, it selects the type of game you wish to play. The options are <color:keyword>normal</color> (a full game with a wilderness), <color:keyword>coffee-break</color> (an accelerated game with no wilderness) and <color:keyword>instant-coffee</color> (an ultra-accelerated game). Game speed selection is not available in Beginner Mode, where the coffee-break setting is always used.

When you are happy with your character choices, press <color:keypress>RET</color> to move on to the next screen. You can always <color:keypress>ESC</color> to back up and make changes, so experiment as much as you want.

<topic:Stats><style:heading>The Stats Screen</style>
On this screen, you enter your starting stats. You do this by allocating points to each stat; you have a total of 30 points to spend, though you can get some more by allocating negative points to stats you really don't care about at all. Very high starting stats are expensive. By default, the game tries to guess a reasonable allocation, and if you are a new player, you might just want to use the defaults.

Here is a sample screen:

Follow the instructions to make changes. If your point total exceeds 30, the option to begin playing will be disabled until you decrease your overall score. When you are ready, press <color:keypress>ENTER</color> to begin play!

<topic:WhatsNext><style:heading>Where to Go from Here?</style>
You can begin playing at this point. Use the help system (<color:keypress>?</color>) to learn the basic commands. You may also wish to read some additional help files, like the <link:general.txt> General Information document or the <link:tang.txt> Newbie Guide; they explain more about what you'll be up against, and contain tips to help get you started. There is much more in the in-game help besides, but you probably don't really want to bury yourself in 500 pages of documentation!

<topic:CharAttributes><style:heading>Character Attributes</style>
During the game (and even during the birth process), you will see many different numerical values that are used to measure or determine your character's relative skills and abilities. Here's a quick overview:

  <indent><color:B>Statistics</color>
Each character has six basic statistics (or more simply <color:keyword>stats</color>). These are strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma, and they modify the abilities of the character in a variety of ways. For example, strength affects your carrying capacity, the amount of damage you do to a monster when you hit it, and the number of blows per round you get with a weapon. See <link:birth.txt#PrimaryStats> below for more detail on the basic statistics.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Experience (EXP/XP)</color>
Experience affects almost everything else about your character. Experience is mostly gained by slaying monsters, but can also be earned by casting spells for the first time, disarming traps or unlocking doors. Certain classes may also gain experience by destroying specific dungeon spellbooks, and there are potions in the dungeon that will boost your experience if you quaff them. The Android race follows its own unique experience rules.

When your character's experience crosses certain fixed boundaries, you will attain a new <color:keyword>character level</color> (up to a maximum of 50). When this happens, your hit point pool, mana pool (if any) and primary skills will all increase; you might also gain new powers or abilities, or get to improve a stat of your choice. The character level boundaries depend on the Experience Factor noted above.

Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus potentially also lower your character level. Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical means, through town services, or simply by regaining the experience all over again.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Gold (AU)</color>
Each character starts with some gold, which can be used to buy items and services from the shops and other buildings in towns. More gold can be obtained by selling items to the shops, taking it from the corpses of dead monsters, mining it, or simply by finding it lying on the dungeon floor.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Hit Points (HP)</color>
Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the character can sustain before he dies. Your HP pool depends on your character level, race, class, personality, constitution, equipment and life rating, and can be temporarily boosted with magic; see <link:faq.txt#LifeRating> for a detailed explanation. Lost hit points may be regained by resting, or by a variety of magical means.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Spell Points (SP/Mana)</color>
Many characters have spell points, or mana, which represents how many spells they can cast. Your mana pool depends on your character level, class, the primary spellcasting stat of your class, and any penalties from sources like excessively heavy armor (see <link:magic.txt#CastingSpells>). Lost spell points may be regained by resting or by magical means.
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Skills</color>
Each character has several primary skills: disarming, magic device skill, saving throw, stealth, searching, perception, melee, and archery (bows/throws). These skills are derived from the character's race, class, personality, stats, level and magical equipment. The skills are described in more detail below (see <link:birth.txt#PrimarySkills>).
</indent>
  <indent><color:B>Speed</color>
Speed is an incredibly important attribute. The speed system is somewhat complicated; but basically, the more speed somebody has (whether it's you or a monster), the more often they get a turn compared to everybody else. If you are really slow, an enemy might get four or five or six moves for every one move you get, which obviously isn't ideal - but won't it be fun when you get more speed and can turn the tables?

Losing speed is very easy: just carry more items than your strength comfortably allows. But to increase your speed you generally need magic, either in the form of a spell or potion, or in the form of an enchanted piece of equipment (such as <color:keyword>Boots of Speed</color>). Potions of Speed will serve the early player well, and you should use them liberally against foes that seem too powerful otherwise (especially quest monsters and level guardians!). As you dive deeper, you will quickly find normal unenchanted speed insufficient; even with bags of HP, you could still die from full health without getting a single action if your opponent is too fast compared to you.
</indent>
<topic:PrimaryStats><style:heading>Statistics</style>
Each character has six basic stats (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma) which modify the abilities of the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value, ranging from a minimum of 3 to a tipping point at 18, and beyond that into a fractional range represented as <color:keyword>18/01</color> through <color:keyword>18/220</color>; 18/220 is the maximal value, and generally displayed as <color:keyword>18/***</color>. In this notation, 18/10 is equivalent to what a new player might intuitively think of as 19, 18/20 is equivalent to 20 etc.; but the switch in notations makes it clear that there is a tipping point at 18, beyond which sources of permanent stat gain work in a very different way.

As you play the game, your stats can be increased through magical means, as a reward for accomplishing a difficult task, or as a reward for gaining enough experience to advance to a key level. Eventually, your stats will reach their internal maximum value (or <color:keyword>stat cap</color>), which is a value between 18/70 and 18/130 and is randomly chosen at character birth. At this point, it will be up to your race, class and personality modifiers, magical equipment, and maybe other sources like a bizarre mutation, to boost your stats further up to the 18/*** limit.

Your <color:keyword>primary stat</color> (or <color:keyword>spellcasting stat</color>) determines your spell fail rates and the size of your mana pool, as well as how many spells you can learn if you are a book spellcaster. As a general rule, if your spellcasting stat falls to 7 or below, you run out of mana altogether.

Which stats are important varies from character to character, although practically everyone wants decent Strength and Intelligence, and Constitution becomes ever more valuable as the game progresses. Melee characters need Dexterity, and magic users require above all whichever stat is their spellcasting stat. Allocate your points accordingly!

  <indent><color:B>Strength (STR)</color>
Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee combat and with missile weapons. A high strength will improve the number of blows you get with your melee weapon, increases the amount of damage done with each hit, allows you to use heavier weapons without penalties and slightly improves your accuracy. Strength is also useful for tunnelling, bashing doors and simply for carrying heavy items without being slowed down. Many melee classes, such as Maulers, Berserkers and Weaponmasters, use Strength as their primary stat.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Intelligence (INT)</color>
Intelligent characters are better at using magic devices, picking locks and disarming traps. Intelligence also influences how quickly characters learn from their experiences. Intelligence is a common primary spellcasting stat for mage-like spellcasters.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Wisdom (WIS)</color>
Wise characters have higher saving throws, giving them a better chance to resist evil curses and paralysis. Wisdom also affects the speed at which level feelings and object feelings appear. Wisdom is a common spellcasting stat for priest-like classes.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Dexterity (DEX)</color>
Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. High dexterity allows you to get more blows with weapons, thus greatly improving your melee damage; it also improves your accuracy with any weapon, and directly affects your AC by allowing you to dodge blows from enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from the thieves that inhabit the dungeons. Dexterity is the spellcasting stat for a number of classes, including the "default"-selection Burglary Rogue.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Constitution (CON)</color>
Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his body. Characters with a high Constitution receive more hit points and recover from wounds and stunning more rapidly. Blood-Knights use constitution as their primary stat.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Charisma (CHR)</color>
Charisma represents a character's personality and force of will. Characters with a high Charisma receive more favorable pricing at shops, and all charming effects work better with high charisma. Additionally, charisma is used for determining player and monster fear; players with low charisma are often frightened, sometimes even to the point of paralysis (see <link:status.txt#Fear>)! Conversely, charismatic players can more easily break the morale of their foes. A number of classes, such as Bards and Sorcerers, use Charisma as their primary spell stat.</indent>

<topic:PrimarySkills><style:heading>Skills</style>
These attributes are generally based largely on your class, but can also be affected by your race, personality, stats and equipment. They often, but not always, go up with character level:

  <indent><color:B>Melee</color>
Melee skill is very simply a baseline for your accuracy in melee combat (whether armed or unarmed). Strength and Dexterity boost this skill, and you can further boost your accuracy through combat bonuses on equipment. This skill increases with character level, except for Sorcerers who are uniformly poor at melee.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Archery</color>
This skill generally applies both to using ranged missile weapons and to throwing projectiles, although in some cases separate calculations might apply. Archery skill, like melee skill, is a baseline for your accuracy; but exceptionally high Archery skill can also improve your shooting speed and reduce the chance your ammunition breaks on impact. Strength and Dexterity can boost your Archery, although this boost only affects your accuracy and not the additional bonuses noted. Archery improves naturally with character level for all characters except Berserkers and Sorcerers.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Saving Throw</color>
Saving Throw is the ability of your character to resist the effects of spells cast on you by a monster. Most commonly, Saving Throw is applied when the spell involves some kind of curse, either against you or against your equipment. Saving Throw also helps you against paralysis, though having Free Action is also needed for that! This skill increases naturally with level - but you'll also be running into nastier curses at high levels... Saving Throw is affected by Wisdom.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Stealth</color>
The ability to move silently is very useful. Characters with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first blow (or the opportunity to avoid a fight entirely), while characters with low Stealth will be mobbed by enemies as everybody nearby wakes up. Stealth generally does not improve with character level, and depends only on your race, class, personality and equipment. New players should value Stealth highly; the less experience you have handling monster mobs, the less you can afford to invite them.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Disarming</color>
Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and includes picking locks on chests and doors. A successful disarming will gain the character some experience. A trap must be found before it can be disarmed. Dexterity and Intelligence both affect Disarming skill, and this skill also increases with character level.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Magic Device Skill</color>
Using magical devices requires experience and knowledge, and natural spellcasters such as mages tend to be much better at it than melee classes. Device Skill is the most important of all skills, especially in the late game; and although your class accounts for the bulk of your device skill, the bonuses from race and personality are also important simply because the skill itself is so important. Device Skill is affected by Intelligence, and improves with character level.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Perception (Searching Frequency)</color>
<color:B>Searching (Searching Ability)</color>
These two skills are very closely related. Both help you notice secret doors, floor traps, and traps on chests; Searching helps when you are actively looking for them, and Perception might allow you to notice them without actively looking. Searching also improves your ability to see invisible monsters. These skills are based on your race, class, personality and equipment, and generally do not improve with character level.</indent>

<topic:Abilities><style:heading>Additional Abilities</style>

Like stats and skills, these additional abilities help your character survive and get about. They can be affected by your race, class or personality, but only in exceptional cases (apart from Infravision, which is based mostly on your race). As such, these abilities are not as prominently displayed during the birth process, but they do make a difference during the game!

  <indent><color:B>Regeneration</color>
Regeneration determines how quickly you recover lost hit points and mana. It is generally affected only by magical effects or equipment, not by your race or class, though there are some exceptions (for example, Amberites, Beornings, Werewolves and Einherjar regenerate exceptionally fast). If you get hit with an evil curse that affects your regeneration, or suffer hideous mutations that slow it down, the pain will hit very quickly...</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Infravision</color>
Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since dungeons tend to be cool or cold, infravision will not allow your character to see walls or objects, but does allow you to detect warm-blooded creatures up to a certain distance. Infravision works equally well with or without a light source. Many monsters are cold-blooded and so not detected by infravision, but especially in the early game (when warm-blooded monsters are more common and See Invisible is often lacking) infravision can make a difference. Most non-human races have some innate infravision, and any race can gain infravision from magical equipment.</indent>

  <indent><color:B>Digging</color>
This ability allows you to mine for treasures and create new tunnels more effectively. It is affected by Strength, by magical equipment, by digging implements such as picks and shovels, and by the weight of your weapon/digging implement (heavy weapons are better for digging). Digging is not usually affected by race, class or personality, although again there are some exceptions; Lawyers, for instance, are very good at digging.</indent>

<topic:BirthOptions><style:heading>Birth Options</style>
During character generation you may press '=' at any time to access the birth options, unless you selected <color:keyword>Beginner Mode</color> which assigns mostly-default options to you. Popular birth options include <color:keyword>coffee-break mode</color>, which accelerates the game (but removes the wilderness); <color:keyword>no selling</color>, which increases gold drops in the dungeon but prevents the player from selling items for money; and <color:keyword>no scrambling</color>, which removes the controversial Stat Scrambling mechanic from the game and replaces it with an incantation of the evil but less controversial Baby Foul Curse. There are dozens of other birth options as well, some likewise popular, others very niche; see <link:option.txt#Birth> for a detailed explanation of each.

<topic:Reference><style:heading>Reference</style>

<topic:BeginnerMode><style:keyword>Beginner Mode</style>  <indent>Designed for new players, this mode greatly restricts the races and classes available to you. In addition, it removes <color:keyword>Personality</color> from the birth process, automatically assigning you the Ordinary personality (which has absolutely no gameplay effects). Birth option selection (<color:keypress>=</color>) is also disabled to speed up character creation; you will play with automatically assigned, mostly default options. The <color:keyword>effective_speed</color> display option ("Show speeds as energy multipliers") is turned on by default in Beginner Mode, as it makes the meanings of speed values clearer to new players. Finally, this option forces the player to play in <color:keyword>coffee-break mode</color>, which accelerates the game, eliminates the wilderness and uses the special Lite-Town as the only town. Since up staircases don't generate in coffee-break mode, beginners start with extra scrolls of Word of Recall so they (hopefully) won't get stuck in the dungeon.</indent>

<topic:NormalMode><style:keyword>Normal Mode</style>    <indent>This is the standard way to play: the Full Monty, so to speak. All races and classes are available to choose from, even ones that might be under development and not yet fully tested. The player has access to both the Birth Options and the Personality subsystem. Here you may (if you wish!) play with a vast surface wilderness, complete with numerous dungeons and towns to explore.</indent>

<topic:MonsterMode><style:keyword>Monster Mode</style>   <indent>This mode allows the player to play as a monster rather than a normal character. There is no class to choose; instead, the racial (and subracial) choices determine the type of monster you play, and are effectively both your race and your class. There are many options to choose from, including some really zany ones! Most monster forms evolve from weak forms to stronger ones (e.g. from a Forest Troll to a Fire Troll, and so forth); and many forms have unique body types (e.g. a Xorn has two full sets of arms, and can wield up to four melee weapons). In addition, most monster races have a boss who will drop a nifty artifact when slain. But the goal of the game remains the same: kill the <color:keyword>Serpent of Chaos</color>.</indent>

<topic:QuickStart><style:keyword>Quick Start</style>    <indent>Once an existing character dies, you may create a new one from the same savefile. If so, you receive this extra option; choose quick start, and you get a new character with exactly the same race, class, options, and personality as your last character. Since it is common to die early on, Quick Start can save you the tedium of picking the same choices again and again.</indent>

<topic:CharacterName><style:keyword>Character Name</style> <indent>During the birth process, you may change the name of your character. This name will be used for your savefile (unless you created this character inside an existing, already named savefile) and any options and preferences you may set. So choose your name carefully. Changing your name, as you may imagine, is a complicated legal process involving much paperwork (and a hefty fee). Should you decide to change your name in the future, inquire at Count Uldrik's castle and he will direct you how to proceed.</indent>
