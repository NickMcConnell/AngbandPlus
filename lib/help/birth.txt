=== Creating a Character ===

Angband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a character
in the world of Angband.  Perhaps the most important thing you control is the
birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be chosen various
attributes that will affect the future life of your character.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of choices
as to constraints on the type of character you wish to play, followed by
a series of random calculations to generate ("roll up") a random character
matching the appropriate constraints.

Once your character has been generated, you will be given the choice to
generate a new character obeying the same constraints, and once you have
generated more than one character, you can switch back and forth between
the two most recent characters, until you are presented with a personality
that you feel comfortable with.

You may start the entire process over at any time.

Once you have accepted a character you will asked to provide a name for the
character.  In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself.  For example,
on some machines, the chatacter name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk.  On others, the character name specifies
special "pref" files.  And the character name is used on the high score list.


=== Character Characteristics ===

Each character has three primary attributes, sex, race, and class, that
are chosen before the character is generated, and which will stay fixed
for the entire life of that character.  These attributes have many effects,
which will be mentioned as they come up.  Keep in mind that in the current
version of Angband, your choice of race may restrict your choice of class.

Each character has a few secondary attributes, height, weight, social class,
and background history, which are randomly determined, but which are affected
by the sex and race of the character.  In general, these attributes are only
used to provide "flavor" to the character, to assist in the roll playing, but
they do have a few minor effects on the game.  For example, background history
affects social class, which affects the amount of money the character will
start with.  And weight affects carrying capacity and bashing ability.

Each character also has six primary "stats", strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the abilities of the
character in a variety of ways.  Every stat has a numerical value, ranging
from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even higher, into
the "percentile" range, represented as "18/01" through "18/100".  Actually,
every stat can be raised even above 18/100 by magical means, up to a pure
maximum of 18/220, which is represented as "18/***".  Traditionally, a
percentile stat such as "18/50" has been though of as representing a value
part way between 18 and 19, and this is one way to think of them.  However,
often, the best way to view the "bonus" values after the "18/" is as "tenth"
points, since it often takes the same magic to raise a stat from, say, 4 to 5,
or 16 to 17, as it does from, say, 18/40 to 18/50.  The important thing to
remember is that almost all internal calculations "ignore" the final digit
of any "bonus", so that, for example, "18/40" and "18/49" are always have
the same effects.  During character generation, each stat is rolled out as
a number from 8 to 17, with a normal distribution, and is then immediately
modified based on the race and class of the character.

Each character also has several primary "skills", disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, searching frequency, fighting skill,
and shooting skill, which are derived from the character's race, class, level,
stats, and current equipment.  These skills have rather obvious effects, but
will be described more completely below.

Each character may have one or more "racially intrinsic skills", based on
the race of the character.  These may include special resistances, or even
abilities such as infravision.

Each character has experience, which increases as the character becomes more
experienced, and a level, which is based on experience, and also on race and
class.  As the experience rises, so does the level, and as the level rises,
certain other abilities and characteristics rise as well.  Deep down inside,
the real objective of the game is to increase your experience, and certain
other characteristics, and also to collect useful items, to give you a decent
chance against the great Serpent of Chaos.  Certain monsters can "drain" your
experience, and thus your level, which will cause you to lose all of the
effects of the higher level.  Luckily, you can restore drained experience
through magical means, or by simply regaining the experience all over again.

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it hidden in
the dungeon.  Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which
is based on the characters social class (higher is better), charisma (higher
is better), sex (female characters start with more gold), and other stats
(less powerful characters start with more gold).  Each character also starts
out with a few useful items, which may be kept, or sold to a shop-keeper for
more gold.

Each character has an armor class, representing how well the character can
avoid damage.  The armor class is affected by dexterity and the equipment.

Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the character can
sustain before he dies.  Your hit points are derived from your race, class,
level, and constitution, and can be temporarily boosted by magical means.
Hit points may be regained by resting, or by a variety of magical means.

Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how many spells
(or prayers) a character can cast (or pray).  Your spell points are derived
from your class, level, and intelligence (for spells) or wisdom (for prayers).
Spell points may be regained by resting, or by a few magical means.


=== Races ===

There are ten different races that you can choose from in Angband.  Some
races are restricted as to what profession they may be, and each race has
its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. Most races also
have intrinsic abilities.
 
          Human
               The human is the base character.  All other races are com-
               pared to them.  Humans can choose any class and are average
               at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any
               other race because of their shorter life spans.  No racial
               adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human.
 
          Half-Elf
               Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a  human,  but
               not as strong.  Half-elves are slightly better at searching,
               disarming, saving throws, stealth, bows, and magic, but they
               are not as good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any
               class and do not receive any intrinsic abilities.
 
          Elf
               Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
               fighting.  They tend to be smarter and faster than either
               humans or half-elves and also have better wisdom.  Elves
               are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows,
               and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.  Elves
               may choose any class except Paladin.  They resist light
               effects intrinsically.
 
          Hobbits
               Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing,  and
               have good saving throws.  They also are very good at search-
               ing, disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excel-
               lent rogues, but prefer to be called burglars.  They will be
               much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting.
               Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm
               creatures at a distance.  Hobbits can choose between being a
               warrior, mage, or rogue.  They have their dexterity sustained.
               They are very fond of food, and learn, in due time, to cook
               a delicious meal from available ingredients.
 
          Gnome
               Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings.
               They, like  the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like
               homes.  Gnomes make excellent mages, and have very good saving
               throws.  They are good at searching, disarming, perception,
               and stealth.  They have lower strength than humans so they
               are not very good at fighting with hand weapons.  Gnomes have
               fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures
               at a distance.  A gnome may choose between being a warrior,
               mage, priest, or rogue.  Gnomes are intrinsically protected
               against paralysis and some slowing effects.  At higher levels,
               Gnomes learn to teleport at will.
 
          Dwarf
               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
               Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are
               excellent choices for a warrior or priest.  Dwarves tend to
               be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than
               humans.  Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise,
               they resist spells which are cast on them.  Dwarves also have
               very good infra-vision because they live underground.  They
               do have one big drawback, though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and
               proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no
               good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In
               other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.  They can never
               be blinded.  Dwarves also learn to study the structure of a
               dungeon, and can spot things that go unseen by the other races.
 
          Half-Orc
               Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but
               are terrible at magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
               and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.
               Half-Orcs are, let's face it, ugly.  They tend to pay more for
               goods in town.  Half-Orcs do make good warriors and rogues,
               for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great
               constitutions and lots of hit points.  Because of their
               preference to living underground to on the surface, half-orcs
               resist darkness attacks.  Upon reaching experience level 3, a
               half-orc learns to dispel any fear that may be upon him or her.
 
          Half-Troll
               Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points
               than any other character race.  They are also very stupid and
               slow.  They will make great warriors and iffy priests.  They
               are bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.
               They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.
               They also happen to be fun to run...  Half-trolls always have
               their strength sustained.  At higher levels, Half-Trolls learn
               to enter a berserk fury, and regenerate wounds automatically.

          Amberites
               The Amberites are a reputedly immortal race, who are endowed
               with numerous advantages, not only their longevity.  They are
               very tough and endurant; their constitution cannot be reduced,
               and their ability to heal wounds far surpasses that of any
               other race.  Having seen virtually everything, very little
               is new to them, and they gain levels much slower than the
               other races.  But should they advance high enough, they will
               learn the innate Amberite powers of Pattern Mindwalking and
               Shadow Shifting.

          High-Elf
               High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the
               beginning of time. They are masters of all skills, and are
               strong and intelligent, although their wisdom is sometimes
               suspect.  They can play all classes except Paladin, and very
               well at that.  High-elves begin their lives able to see the
               unseen, and resist light effects just like regular elves.
               However, there are few things that they have not seen
               already, and experience is very hard for them to gain.

        Barbarian
                Barbarians are hardy men of the north. They are fierce in
                combat, and their wrath is feared throughout the world.
                Combat is their life: they feel no fear, and they learn
                to enter battle frenzy at will even sooner than half-trolls.
                Barbarians are, however, suspicious of magic, which makes
                magic devices fairly hard for them to use, and also makes
                it impossible for them to play Mages. They cannot play
                Paladins, either, because their wild bloodlust is totally
                incompatible with the strict discipline of knighthood.

        Half-Ogre
                Half-Ogres are like Half-Orcs, but only more so. They
                are big, bad, and stupid. For warriors, they have all
                the necessary attributes, and they can even become
                wizards: after all, they are related to Ogre Magi,
                from whom they have learned the skill of setting
                trapped runes once their level is high enough. Like Half-
                Orcs, they resist darkness, and like Half-Trolls, they
                have their strength sustained.

        Half-Giant
                Half-Giants are not too unusual, as there has been a
                tradition according to which it is a noble and brave thing
                to do to consort a giant (especially a giant-maid). Never-
                theless, the poor offspring of such a union is seldom very
                popular in the world of men. Their limited intelligence
                makes it impossible for them to become full spellcasters,
                but with their huge strength they make excellent warriors.
                They also love to wander in the wilderness, and can become
                rangers. No ordinary wall can withstand the fury of a giant,
                or a half-giant, and at higher levels they can learn the
                power of magical digging. Their thick skin makes them
                resistant to shards, and like Half-Ogres and Half-Trolls,
                they have their strength sustained.

        Half-Titan
                Half-mortal descendants of the mighty titans, these
                immensely powerful creatures put almost any other race
                to shame. They may lack the fascinating special powers
                of certain other races, but their enhanced attributes
                more than make up for that. They learn to estimate the
                strengths of their foes, and their love for law and
                order makes them resistant to the effects of Chaos.

        Cyclops
                With but one eye, a cyclops can see more than many
                with two eyes. They are headstrong, and loud noises
                bother them very little. They are not quite qualified
                for the magic using professions, but as a certain Mr
                Ulysses can testify, their accuracy with thrown rocks
                can be deadly...

        Yeek
                Yeeks are among the most pathetic creatures. Fortunately,
                their horrible screams can scare away less confident foes,
                and their skin becomes more and more resistant to acid,
                as they gain experience. But having said that, even a
                mediocre monster can proverbially wipe the floor with
                an unwary yeek.

        Klackon
                Klackons are bizarre semi-intelligent ant-like insectoid
                creatures. They make great servants and warriors, but
                their mental abilities are severely limited. Obedient
                and well-ordered, they can never be confused. They are
                also very nimble, and become faster as they advance
                levels. They are also very acidic, inherently resisting
                acid, and capable of spitting acid at higher levels.

        Kobold
                Kobolds are a weak goblin race. They love poisoned weapons,
                and can learn to throw poisoned darts (of which they carry
                an unlimited supply). They are also inherently resistant to
                poison, and can become adequate fighters, although they are
                not one of the more powerful races.

        Nibelung
                The hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these
                cave-dwellers are not much bothered by darkness. Their
                natural inclination to magical items has made them immune
                to effects which could drain away magical energy, and like
                ordinary dwarves, they can examine the dungeon to discover
                traps and secret doors.

        Dark Elf
                Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by
                darkness attacks, the Dark Elves have a long tradition
                and knowledge of magic. With their intelligence they can
                become superb mages or priests, and they have an inherent
                magic missile attack available to them at a low level. With
                their keen sight, they also learn to see invisible things
                as their relatives High-Elves do, but at a higher level.

        Draconian
                A humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. As they advance
                levels, they gain new elemental resistances (up to Poison
                Resistance), and they also have a breath weapon, which
                becomes more powerful with experience. The exact type of
                the breath weapon depends on the draconian's class and
                level. With their wings, they can easily escape any pit
                trap unharmed.

        Mind Flayer
                A secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their civilization
                may well be older than any other on our planet, and their
                intelligence and wisdom are naturally sustained, and are so
                great that they enable Mind Flayers to become more powerful
                spellcasters than any other race, even if their physical
                attributes are a good deal less admirable. As they advance
                levels, they gain the powers of See Invisible, Telepathy
                and a mind blast attack.

        Imp
                A demon-creature from the nether-world, naturally resistant
                to fire attacks, and capable of learning fire bolt and fire
                ball attacks. They are little loved by other races, but
                can perform fairly well in most professions.

        Golem
                A golem is an artificial creature, built from a lifeless
                raw material like clay, and awakened to life. They are
                nearly mindless, making them useless for professions which
                rely on magic, but as warriors they are very tough. They
                are resistant to poison, they can see invisible things,
                and move freely. At higher levels, they also become resistant
                to attacks which threaten to drain away their life force.
                They also learn to temporarily turn their skin into a very
                hard, stonelike substance. In the most recent version, golems
                gain very little nutrition from ordinary food. They need to
                collect scrolls of satisfy hunger, or perish of exhaustion
                when the life force animating their body runs out. In the
                most recent version golems also gain natural armor class
                bonus from their tough body.

        Skeleton
                There are two types of skeletons: the ordinary, warrior-
                like skeletons, and the spell-using skeletons, which are
                also called liches. As undead beings, skeletons need to
                worry very little about poison or attacks that can drain
                life. They do not really use eyes for perceiving things,
                and are thus not fooled by invisibility. Their bones are
                resistant to sharp shrapnels (not much to cut there),
                and they will quickly become resistant to cold. Should
                a skeleton be unlucky enough to lose some of his or her
                remaining life, he or she will learn to restore it at
                will. It is very hard for skeletons to eat food or drink
                potions. Although the magical effects of these will affect
                the skeleton even without entering the skeleton's (non-
                existent) belly, the potion / food itself will fall through
                the skeleton's jaws, giving no nutritional benefit.

        Zombie
                Much like Skeletons, Zombies too are undead horrors: they
                are resistant to life-draining attacks, and can learn to
                restore their life-force. Like skeletons, they become
                resistant to cold-based attacks (actually earlier than
                skeletons), resist poison and can see invisible. While
                still vulnerable to cuts (unlike skeletons), Zombies are
                resistant to Nether. Like golems, they gain very little
                nutrition from the food of mortals. However, Zombies are,
                as the name implies, practically mindless: in this company,
                Groo would seem a genius.

        Vampire
                One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an
                awe-inspiring sight. Yet this mighty creature has a serious
                weakness: the bright rays of sun are its bane, and it will
                need to flee the surface to the deep recesses of earth until
                the sun finally sets. Darkness, on the other hand, only makes
                the Vampire stronger. As undead, the Vampire has a firm hold
                on its life force, and resists nether attacks. The Vampire
                also resists cold and poison based attacks. It is, however,
                susceptible to its perpetual hunger for fresh blood, which
                can only be satiated by sucking the blood from a nearby
                monster, which is the Vampire's special power. It should be
                noted that the vampires are so sensitive to daylight that
                even certain artifact light items which are filled with
                daylight will hurt them if they try to wield the items.
                Fortunately, the vampires do not really need these items,
                since they radiate an aura of 'dark light' of their own.
                Light resistance will, in any case, protect the vampire
                from the adverse effects of sunlight.

        Spectre
                Another powerful undead creature: the spectre is a ghastly
                apparition, surrounded by an unearthly green glow. They exist
                only partially on our plane of existence: half-corporeal,
                they can pass through walls, although the density of the
                wall will hurt them in the process of doing this. The spectre
                can scream an eldritch howl, which is enough to scare lesser
                monsters witless. As undead, they have a firm hold on their
                life force, see invisible, and resist poison and cold. They
                also resist nether; in fact, their half-corporeal form
                actually grows stronger from the effects of nether. At
                higher levels they develop telepathic abilities. Spectres
                make superb spellcasters, but their physical form is very
                weak. Like Golems and Zombies, Spectres gain almost no
                nutrition from ordinary food.

        Sprite
                One of the several fairy races, sprites are very small.
                They have tiny wings, and can fly over traps that may open
                up beneath them. They enjoy sunlight intensely, and need
                worry little about light based attacks. Although physically
                among the weakest races, Sprites are very talented in magic,
                and can become highly skilled wizards. Sprites have the
                special power of spraying Sleeping Dust, and at higher
                levels they learn to fly faster.

        Beastman
                This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos.
                It is not an independent race but rather a humanoid creature,
                most often a human, twisted by the Chaos, or a nightmarsh
                crossbreed of a human and a beast. All Beastmen are accustomed
                to Chaos so much that they are untroubled by confusion and
                sound, although raw Logrus can still have effects on them.
                Beastmen revel in chaos, as it twists them more and more.
                Beastmen are subject to mutations: when they have been
                created, they receive a random mutation. After that,
                every time they advance a level they have a little chance
                of gaining yet another mutation.


=== Classes ===
 
 
          Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  Some
          classes  will  not be available to certain races, for instance, a
          Half-Troll cannot become a Paladin.  For the first few adventures
          it  is  suggested that you run a warrior or rogue.  Spell casting
          generally requires a more experienced  player  that  is  familiar
          with survival techniques.
 
          Warrior
               A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  of
               his  problems  by cutting them to pieces, but will occasion-
               ally fall back  on the help of a magical device.  His  prime
               stats  are  Strength  and Constitution, and a good Dexterity
               can really help at times.  A Warrior will be good at  Fight-
               ing and Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills.
               A Warrior learns no magic.
 
          Mage
               A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack
               his  way  through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his
               magic to defeat,  deceive, confuse, and escape.  A  mage  is
               not really complete without an assortment of magical devices
               to use in addition to his spells.  He can master the  higher
               level  magical  devices far easier than anyone else, and has
               the best saving throw to resist effects of  spells  cast  at
               him.  Intelligence  and   Dexterity  are  his primary stats.
               There is no rule that says  a  mage  cannot  become  a  good
               fighter, but spells are his true realm.
               A mage can choose any two realms of magic in which he wishes
               to specialize.
 
          Priest
               A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore  the
               dungeon  only  to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if
               treasure just happens to fall into  their  packs,  well,  so
               much  more  to  the  glory of their church!  Priests receive
               their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose which
               spells they will learn.  They are familiar with magical dev-
               ices, preferring to call them instruments of  god,  but  are
               not  as good as a mage in their use.  Priests have good sav-
               ing throws,  and  make  decent  fighters,  preferring  blunt
               weapons  over  edged  ones.  Wisdom  and  Charisma  are  the
               priest's primary stats.
               There are two types of priests:  the 'good' Priests who  are
               trained in Life magic, and the 'evil' dark Priests who  have
               chosen to study  Death magic instead.  In addition to  their
               primary  realm  of  magic (Life or Death  magic),  they  can
               select a secondary realm from  Arcane , Trump,  Nature,  and
               Chaos.

          Rogue
               A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his  cunning,
               but  is capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He
               is the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible
               for  him  to  overcome.  A rogue has a high stealth allowing
               him to sneak around many creatures without having to  fight,
               or sneak up and get the first blow.  A rogue's perception is
               higher than any other class, and many times he will notice a
               trap  or  secret  door  before having to search.  A rogue is
               better than warriors or paladins with magical  devices,  but
               still  can  not  rely on their performance.  Rogues can also
               learn a few spells, but not the  powerful  offensive  spells
               magi  can use.  A rogue's primary stats are Intelligence and
               Dexterity.
               Rogues  who  wish  to  specialize  as burglars can choose to
               study Sorcery while Death magic is  available to rogues  who
               wish to become Assassins.  In  the  latest  versions, Arcane
               magic is available for 'common' thieves, and Trump magic for
               card sharks.
 
          Ranger
               A Ranger is a warrior/mage.  He is a good fighter,  and  the
               best  of  the  classes  with a missile weapon such as a bow.
               The ranger learns spells much more slowly than a  mage,  but
               is  capable  of  learning all  but the most powerful spells.
               Because a ranger is really  a  dual  class  character,  more
               experience  is  required for him to advance.  A ranger has a
               good stealth, good perception, good searching, a good saving
               throw,  and is good with magical devices.  His primary stats
               are Intelligence and Dexterity.
               All  rangers  are  trained  in  Nature  magic. They can also
               select  a secondary realm of magic  (from  Sorcery,  Arcane,
               Trump, Chaos and Death) but their skills are more limited in
               the second realm than in their native Nature magic.
 
          Paladin
               A Paladin is a warrior/priest.  He is a very  good  fighter,
               second  only to the warrior class, but not very good at mis-
               sile weapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace then the
               priest,  but  can even  receive the most  powerful  prayers.
               Because a paladin is  really  a  dual  class  character,  it
               requires  more  experience  to advance him.  A paladin lacks
               much in the way of abilities.  He is poor at  stealth,  per-
               ception,  searching,  and  magical devices.  He has a decent
               saving throw due to his divine alliance.  His primary  stats
               are Strength and Charisma.
               All paladins are trained in Life magic, and they regard  the
               realms of magic as the Devil's work. The variant class,  the
               "Death Knight",  is  trained in Death magic instead of  Life
               magic.

          Warrior-Mage
               A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a  cross
               between the warrior  and mage classes. While their brothers,
               the Rangers, specialize in Nature magic and survival skills,
               true Warrior-Mages attempt to reach the best of both worlds:
               as magicians,  they are  trained  in  Arcane magic  and  can
               select  another realm,  eventually  learning every spell  in
               both of them  (although  slower  than  true  magicians);  as
               warriors they are much superior to the usual Mage class. The
               Warrior-Mage  is   a   truly  powerful  class,    which   is
               recommended  for  the  players   who want to cast spells but
               whose mages tend to  die too quickly.   However,  the  power
               does not  come  without  a  price:   Warrior-Mages   require
               more experience  to  advance levels than any other class.

          Chaos Warrior
               Chaos Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon
               Lords of Chaos. Every Chaos Warrior has a Patron Demon, such
               as  Arioch,  Mabelode  or  Balaan.  Whenever a Chaos Warrior
               advances a  level,  his Patron Demon  may reward him with  a
               Gift of Chaos: he might be healed or polymorphed,  his stats
               could be increased, or he might be rewarded with  an awesome
               weapon.  Or his  Patron Demon  might,  for some reason,  get
               annoyed with him and do something fairly nasty to him,  like
               surround him  with monsters,  drain his stats  or  wreck his
               equipment. Or they might simply ignore him. The Demon  Lords
               of Chaos  are  chaotic and  unpredictable indeed.  The exact
               type of reward depends on  the Patron Demon Lord  (different
               Demons give different rewards) and chance.
               Chaos Warriors  are  very good fighters,  but they are  also
               trained in Chaos magic, and can learn every Chaos spell.

          Monk
               The Monk  character class is  very different from all  other
               classes. Although they can use weapons and armour just  like
               any other class, their training in  martial arts makes  them
               much more powerful with  no armour nor weapons.  To gain the
               resistances necessary  for survival at higher levels  a monk
               may need to wear some kind of armour,  but if the armour  he
               wears is too heavy,  it  will  severely disturb  his martial
               arts maneuvers. As the monk advances levels,  new,  powerful
               forms of attack become available. His defensive capabilities
               (blocking and dodging) increase likewise,  but if armour  is
               being worn, their effect decreases. It is rumoured that  the
               monastic training even  makes  monks faster than  any  other
               character class!  Fortunately,  also the amount of armour  a
               monk  can  wear,  while  still  fighting  efficiently,  also
               increases with experience.
               There are three kinds of monasteries: those devoted to Life,
               those devoted to Nature,  and those devoted to Death.  These
               are the three possible realms of magic avaiilable to a monk,
               who can learn every prayer in the realm of his choice.

        Mindcrafter
               The Mindcrafter is  character  who  uses  the powers of mind
               instead of magic. These powers are unique to the Mindcrafter
               class,  and vary from simple extrasensory powers  to  mental
               domination  of others.  Since these powers are  developed by
               the practice of certain disciplines,  a Mindcrafter requires
               no spellbooks  to use them.  The available powers are simply
               determined by the character level.  The Mindcrafter uses the
               wisdom score to determine how well he / she can  perform the
               psychic powers,  and in combat  a Mindcrafter is roughly the
               equivalent  of  a  priest,  although a Mindcrafter  is never
               penalized for wielding an edged weapon (unlike a priest).

        High Mage
               High  Mages  are  specialist Mages  of the highest order. In
               most respects they are exactly like ordinary Mages, although
               their  spell stat is slightly higher.   Instead of selecting
               two realms of magic,  a High Mage selects  only one realm of
               magic  and  studies it extremely well,   gaining substantial
               benefits in mana costs, minimum levels and failure rates.
 

=== Stats ===

          Strength
               Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee
               combat.  A high strength can improve your chances of hitting
               as well as the amount of damage done with each hit.  Char-
               acters with low strengths may receive penalties.  Strength
               is also useful in tunneling and in carrying heavy items.
 
          Intelligence
               Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like
               spellcasters, mages, rangers, and rogues.  Intelligence
               will affect the number of spells you may learn each level as
               well as the number of spell points you receive.  A high
               intelligence may also improve your chances of successfully
               casting a spell.  You cannot learn spells if your intelligence
               is 7 or lower.  A good intelligence can also help with using
               magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.
 
          Wisdom
               The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability
               of a priest or paladin to use prayers, just like intelligence
               affects spellcasting.  Again, high wisdom will increase the
               number of spell points you have and increase the number of
               prayers you can learn each level, while improving the chance
               that a prayer will be successful.  A good wisdom can also
               help to improve your chances of resisting magical spells cast
               upon you by monsters.
 
          Dexterity
               Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high
               dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with
               lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and
               will increase his chances of hitting with any weapon and
               dodging blows from enemies.  Dexterity is also useful in
               picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from
               some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons.
 
          Constitution
               Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
               body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
               character with a high constitution will receive more hit
               points and also recover them faster while resting.
 
          Charisma
               Charisma represents a character's personality and physical
               appearance.  A character with a high charisma will receive
               better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a
               very low charisma may be robbed blind.  A high charisma will
               also mean more starting money for the character.
 

=== Abilities (outdated) ===

          Characters possess some different abilities which can  help  them
          to survive.  The starting abilities of a character are based upon
          race and class.  Abilities may be adjusted by high or low  stats,
          and may increase with the level of the character.
 
          Fighting
               Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
               fists.  Normally  a  character  gets  a single blow from any
               weapon, but if his dexterity and strength are  high  enough,
               he  may  receive  more blows per round with lighter weapons.
               Strength and dexterity both modify the  ability  to  hit  an
               opponent.  This skill increases  with the level of the char-
               acter.
 
          Shooting Ability
               Using  ranged  missile  weapons  (and  throwing  objects) is
               included  in this skill.  Different stats apply to different
               weapons, but this ability may modify the distance an  object
               is  thrown/fired, the amount of damage done, and the ability
               to hit a creature.  This skill increases with the  level  of
               the character.
 
          Saving Throws
               A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to  resist  the
               effects  of  a spell cast on him by another person/creature.
               This does not include spells cast on the player by  his  own
               stupidity,  such  as  quaffing a nasty potion.  This ability
               increases with the level of the  character,  but  then  most
               high  level  creatures  are  better at casting spells, so it
               tends to even out.  A high wisdom also increases this  abil-
               ity.
 
          Stealth
               The ability to move  silently about is very useful.  Charac-
               ters with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents,
               gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to  notice
               a  stealthy  character  entirely, allowing a player to avoid
               certain fights.  This skill is based entirely upon race  and
               class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
 
          Disarming
               Disarming is the  ability  to  remove  traps  (safely),  and
               includes  picking  locks  on  traps and doors.  A successful
               disarming will gain the character  some experience.  A  trap
               must  be  found  before  it  can be disarmed.  Dexterity and
               intelligence both modify the ability  to  disarm,  and  this
               ability increases with the level of the character.
 
          Magical Devices
               Using a magical device such as  a  wand  or  staff  requires
               experience  and  knowledge.  Spell  users such as  magi  and
               priests are therefore much better at using a magical  device
               than say a warrior.  This skill is modified by intelligence,
               and increases with the level of the character.
 
          Searching Frequency (Perception)
               Perception  is  the  ability  to  notice  something  without
               actively  seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon
               race and class, and  will  never  improve  unless  magically
               enhanced.
 
          Searching Ability (Searching)
               To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
               and  traps on chests.  Rogues are the best at searching, but
               magi,  rangers, and priests are also good at it.  This skill
               is  based  entirely  upon  race  and  class,  and will never
               improve unless magically enhanced.
 
 
 
=== Combinations of Race and Class ===

These are the classes that are recommended for different races. You can
still select a race that is not in the chart, but these combinations are
either rather poor (like a zombie mage) or as a concept so silly that they
are not recommended. If you pick a combination that is not on the chart,
don't complain if things don't turn out as you expected them to.

          Infra-vision
               Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources. Since  most
               of  the  dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow
               the player to see walls and objects.  Infra-vision will allow
               a  character  to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a cer-
               tain distance.  This ability works equally well with or with
               out  a  light source.  The majority of Angband's creatures are
               cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit  up  by  a
               light  source.  Most non human races have innate  infra-vision
               ability.  Human can gain infra-vision only if it is magically
               enhanced.
