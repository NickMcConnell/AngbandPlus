     Angband is a challenging single-player dungeon adventure game in which you,
the player, control a character in a world of magic and cold steel.  During the
course of your adventures, you may learn long-forgotten secrets, collect
wondrous objects, and defeat terrible foes.  Perhaps, if you are very skilled,
you may even defeat the Dread Enemy himself:  Morgoth, Lord of Darkness.

     But only if you are very skilled indeed.

     Angband is a variant of Moria, which is a descendant of Rogue.  Its primary
inspiration is the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, among the greatest wordsmiths of
the English language.  You will also notice some Dungeons and Dragons
conventions, ancient and religious mythology, and the fables and lore of the
European Middle Ages.

============================ Overview of the Game =============================


     This section briefly describes creating a character, playing your first
game, and the most important information displays.  To learn more about these
things, consult the sections on your character and on interfaces.



====== Loading and Creating Characters ======

DOS, UNIX, etc.
     The game will load any savefile named "player", or any that you specified
on the command line.

Windows, Macintosh
     The game will wait for you to use the menu commands "file -> new" and "file
-> open".

Loading or birth:
     If the savefile contains a living character, you begin the game where you
left off.  If the character in the loaded savefile is slain, or no (valid)
savefile was loaded, or you asked to play a new game, you go to the character
creation display.

Creating new characters:
     Commands you may use during character generation include:
     a-z)    Choose among the possibilities offered
     *, ESC) Choose at random
     ?)      Get help
     S)      Start over at the beginning
     Q)      Quit the game

Choices, choices:
     You first choose a gender:  Male or female.  This has no significant effect
on your adventures.
     You then choose a race.  This has a major effect on almost all character
abilities and special attributes.  See the section on races for more details.
     You than choose a class.  This makes all the difference in how the game
will play.  See the section on classes.
     You may then set various birth options, which are described in the options
section.

Rolling up:
     If you set the "Allow specification of minimal stats" option, you choose
the minimum acceptable vital statistics (stats) for your character.  Be careful
not to ask for too much.  You enter stats as numbers:  16, 17, 18, 18/10, 18/20,
and so on.
     If you set the "Allow purchase of stats using points" option, you build up
stats by spending points.

     Once you have done this, you are presented with another display showing
more information about your character.  You also see this display whenever you
press 'C'.  Reroll by pressing "r", or build up stats using points, until
satisfied.

     You then give your character a name, and begin play.



====== Game Tutorial:  The Novice's Guide ======

     When you begin the game, you start out in a town with stores happy to sell
you whatever they stock and you can afford.  Visit the stores and stop by your
very own home (the symbol '8'), where you can safely stash all sorts of useful
gear for later use.

     Look at the left side of the screen, where all the most important info
about you is displayed.  Reading from the top, you'll see your race, class,
current title, experience, and money on hand.  Your race and class never change,
but you can gain more experience points by killing monsters and more gold by
selling the loot they drop.
     Below these are the six vital statistics:  Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.  Near the bottom, you will see your
armour class, hit points, and (if you can learn magic) your spell points.
Armour class shields you from direct damage.  Hitpoints are your life wrapped up
in a number, so run from anything that drops them too low, too fast.

     Get familiar with some of the commands you have available to you, either by
reading the help, or by experimenting, whichever you prefer.
     To exit this tutorial, hit escape.  When ready to continue, type '?' to
open up help, then press '1', then '2'.



     Okay, time to get playing!  Pick up an inexpensive weapon (store 3), some
flasks of oil (store 1) or a sling and some shots (store 3), some light armour
(stores 1 and 2), and some phase door scrolls and potions of cure light wounds
(Stores 4 or 5).  If one is available, get your hands on a lantern, because the
extra light it provides is very handy.  Once you've earned a little money,
invest in a shovel or a pickaxe.  Now, 'w'ear a torch or your lantern, your
armour, and your weapon.
     See that down staircase '>'?  It's the entrance to the deadly, lucrative
dungeon.  Head down (once on top of the staircase, type '>').
     Once you do that, you will find yourself in a dungeon of rooms and
corridors.  Since you have already wielded a light source, you can see, even if
you are not in a magically lit room.  Go off and explore the dungeon.  When your
light runs out, re'F'uel it.  When you get hungry, 'E'at some of the food your
character started out with.
     When you meet your first monster, pepper it with sling shots (press 'f' to
fire) until it reaches you, and hit it with your weapon (move into it) until
it's dead.  If your HPs drop too low, quaff a potion of cure light wounds, read
a scroll of phase door, or run away.
     When you get enough money and objects to sell, go back up to the town.  If
you can learn spells, practice them in safe places.  If you have questions, the
'?' key is there to help.

Have fun!



====== Interfaces:  A Brief Description =====


--- The title screen ---

     When you start up the game, a title screen appears, bearing the game name,
version, and some credits.  Also on this screen are the three most important
Angband resources:
     The Angband home page at "http://www.thangorodrim.net/" contains the
current source and executables, special files, helpful comments, hints, and
links, and the latest Angband news.
     Angband changes maintainers every so often.  The current one is Robert
Ruehlmann.  If you want to send him comments, or make sure your bug report gets
heard, email "rr9@thangorodrim.net".
     The Angband newsgroup is at "news:rec.games.roguelike.angband"; it's filled
with helpful folks.  If you want to talk about Angband or ask for help, this
discussion forum is the place to go.


--- The main screen ---

     Most of the game is spent in the main screen.  This is divided into four
parts:

     1)  The message line is located at the top of the screen; here all sorts of
messages are shown.  If in the heat of combat you skip past one too many, you
can display it again by pressing control-P.
     2)  The left side of the screen is used to display important information.
     3)  Most of the screen displays your surroundings.  You can take a closer
look by pressing 'l'ook (or e'x'amine).
     4)  The bottom line of the main screen shows various status displays, such
as your speed, ailments, depth, and so on.


--- The character screen  ('C') ---

     The character information display you see when first starting the game can
be recalled by typing 'C'.  Here you can review your attributes, change names,
and save character dumps to file (which appear in the "lib/user" directory).


--- The help screen  ('?') ---

     The online help system is available by typing '?'.  You can also learn more
about the symbols you see on screen by typing '/', then the symbol you wish to
learn more about.


--- The options screen  ('=') ---

     You can adjust the way the game looks and behaves by typing '=' to enter
the options screen.


--- The knowledge screen  ('~') ---

     Detailed listings of known artifacts, uniques, and objects are available
through the knowledge menu, which you access by typing '~'.


--- The death interface ---

     If you should die, you will see a tombstone and be able to check out your
slain character one last time.  Here you can:
     - display the character screen and see your possessions,
     - review the final messages,
     - save information in a character dump,
     - see the high score table, and
     - fully identify individual items.




=============================== Your Character ================================


====== Races ======

     There are eleven different races that you may choose among, representing
most of the speaking peoples found in Tolkien's books, plus Gnomes and Kobolds.
Races differ in vital statistics, and tend to be better at some abilities than
at others.
     Good races for new players are Dunedain and High-Elves (powerful but slow
at gaining levels), and Elves and Dwarves (good abilities, not too slow at
gaining levels).

Human:
     A flexible and adaptive race, humans are found all over Middle-Earth, from
desert Harad to icy Horodwaith.  They have no special adjustments to stats, and
no special strengths or weaknesses.  This, combined with their solid hitpoints,
makes them flexible but not powerful adventurers.  They probably get the best
prices in stores, on average.  Humans may choose any class.

Half-Elf:
     The descendants of Elves and Humans, Half-elves are more intelligent and
dexterous than humans, and are slightly better at many abilities, but are not so
strong, tough, or good at melee.  Half-elves sustain dexterity inherently, and
have some infravision.  They may choose any class.

Elf:
     Known as the Elder Race, and as the First-Born, Elves are famed for their
knowledge and craftsmanship.  They are somewhat weaker, less wise, and less
robust than humans, but have superior intelligence and strong magical abilities.
They are fond of bows, somewhat weak in melee, and have some infravision.  They
sustain dexterity and resist light inherently.  Elves may choose to be warriors,
mages, rogues, or rangers.

Hobbit:
     Hobbits are shy, retiring folk with enough good sense to share.  They live
in homes with circular entranceways built partially underground, and are the
smallest of all the races.  Although they are weak, have perilously few
hitpoints, and are very poor at melee, all of their other abilities are
extraordinary.  Hobbits are highly intelligent, dexterous, and hardy, have
innate infravision, and resist attacks on their life force.  They may choose to
be warriors, rogues (which they prefer to call burglars), and rangers.

Gnome:
     Gnomes are the pudgy pranksters of the dungeon; if they can kill something
in a humorous way, so much the better.  They may be small and ugly, but can
outbargain and outwit just about anyone.  They are among the frailer races, and
not powerful in combat, but have solid basic abilities, are highly intelligent
and dexterous, have innate infravision, and -- most importantly -- are immune to
paralyzation.  A gnome may choose to be a warrior, mage, priest, or rogue.

Dwarf:
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  They are strong,
wise, tough, and have pretty good basic skills; although not very good at
casting spells, they make excellent priests.  Dwarves are quite good at melee
combat, have innate infravision, and -- a major advantage -- can never be
blinded.  They do have one big drawback, though:  Dwarves are loudmouthed and
proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason,
screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a
miserable stealth.  They can become warriors, priests, or paladins.

Half-Orc:
     The bastard offspring of humans and orcs, half-orcs are ugly, strong, and
have very bad attitudes.  Their magic is a little suspect, as are most of their
skills, but they know how to fight and can take as much damage as they dish out.
Most other races dislike them and so they have a hard time in stores.  Half-orcs
have innate infravision and, like orcs themselves, resist darkness and its
effects.  They can become warriors, priests, or rogues.

Half-Troll:
     Half-trolls are built like blocks of granite; no other race can match their
strength or recover hitpoints as quickly.  Their hand-to-hand combat prowess is
fearsome and they are amazingly tough.  Unfortunately, they do poorly at almost
everything else, are very noisy, need to eat a lot, and have a hard time in
stores.  Half-trolls will be bad at anything that requires heavy thinking.  They
have innate infravision and always have their strength sustained.  They make
powerful warriors and interesting priests.

Dunadan:
     Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder race surpasses
the abilities of other humans in every field and has superior vital statistics.
However, being men of the world, very little is new to them, and levels are very
hard to gain...  They can play all classes except the rogue, as Dunedain are too
noble to stoop to petty crime (when a Dunadan goes evil, he does it in a much
bigger way).  Their constitution cannot be reduced.

High-Elf:
      High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard and answered
the call from the Valar at the very beginning of time, before the sun and moon
were made, and lived in the Blessed Realm for long ages before returning to
mortal lands.  They are masters of all abilities, and are agile and intelligent,
although their wisdom is a little suspect.  No other race is quite as good at
magic, and none is so skilled with missile weapons.  High-elves are able to see
the unseen, have good infravision, and have innate resistance to light.
However, having lived so long and learnt so much, it is very hard for them to
advance further.  High-Elves may become warriors, mages, priests, rangers, or
paladins.

Kobold:
     Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell underground.
They are dexterous and tough, but ugly, and have relatively few hitpoints.
Kobolds can see in the dark better than almost any other race, are very
stealthy, and -- their most important advantage -- are intrinsically resistant
to poisons of all kinds.  They can be warriors, rangers, rogues, or priests.


====== Classes ======

     Your choice of class makes all the difference to how the game plays.  They
vary greatly in toughness, combat and magic power, and ability to notice,
detect, and avoid things.  Some suggested classes for new players are warriors
and paladins.

Warrior:
     A hack-and-slash character who solves most of his problems by cutting them
to pieces.  He is unchallengeable with melee weapons, and is also good with all
missile launchers.  He becomes resistant to fear at level 30.  Although a
warrior gets a lot of hitpoints, he is poor at the dungeon survival skills,
vulnerable to magic, and suffers greatly from his ignorance of spells and many
magical devices.  He gets fast, detailed feelings on weapons and armour (pseudo-
ID).

Mage:
     A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack his way
through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat, deceive,
baffle, and escape.  A mage excels in the use of magical devices, and finds them
very handy when his mana runs low.  He has excellent magical defences, but
dangerously poor physical ones.  He has almost no chance of sensing wargear.
There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are
his true realm.  Intelligence is his spell stat.

Priest:
     Covenanted with a mighty and generous god.  He explores the dungeon only to
cleanse the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to fall into
his pack, well, so much more to the glory of the Church!  A Priest is familiar
with magical devices, preferring to call them "Instruments of God", but is not
as good as a mage in their use.  A priest can be a decent fighter, especially
when sanctified, but only with blunt or blessed weapons.  Unblessed edged
weapons (swords and polearms) violate the Church's strictures about shedding
blood, and wielding one will hurt his ability to pray successfully.  A Priest
has fast but weak pseudo-ID.  Wisdom is his prayer stat.

Rogue:
     A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is capable
of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He is a master of traps and locks, no
device being impossible for him to overcome, and his stealth often lets him
choose his fights.  A rogue's perception is higher than that of any other class,
and ofttimes he will notice a trap or secret door without having to search.
Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the powerful offensive magic mages
wield.  A rogue has moderately fast, detailed pseudo-ID.  Intelligence is his
spell stat.

Ranger:
     The greatest of bowsmen, capable of eventually firing a bow three times
faster than normal.  He can also hold his own in melee, and has some useful
spells to aid him in need; rangers have many talents.  His dungeon survival
skills are better than average.  A ranger has average-speed, weak pseudo-ID.
Intelligence is his spell stat.

Paladin:
     A champion of the Faith.  He is second only to the warrior in melee, can
use all weapons comfortably, and has some useful prayers to enhance his powers.
Most of his other skills are average:  while his saving throw benefits from his
divine alliance, and his missile skill from his prayers, he is poor at magical
devices, stealth, and searching.  A paladin has slowish but detailed pseudo-ID.
Wisdom is his prayer stat.

     Paladin      +3    -3    +1     0    +2    +2       6       +35%

     To get the total hit dice and experience modifier, add the race and class
numbers together.  For example:  A Dwarven Priest has a hit die of 11 + 2 = 13,
so will get 1d13 extra hit points per level before constitution bonuses.  He has
an experience modifier of 20% + 20% = 40%, so will take 40% more experience to
advance than a human warrior.

     Value for classes are starting ability - final ability.  Note that prayers
and spells can improve many of these skills dramatically.
     Melee blows:  Warriors can get up to 6 blows, mages up to 4, and all other
classes up to 5.
     Missile Shots:  Rangers (eventually) get 3 shots with bows instead of 1.



====== Character Attributes ======

--- Basic attributes ---

Experience:
     As you kill monsters, learn about objects by using them, cast spells and
pray prayers for the first time, disarm traps, and unlock doors (listed in
descending order of importance), you gain experience.

Character Level:
     Your level depends on your experience.  This improves hitpoints and
(usually) spellpoints and most of the basic character abilities, and lets you
learn new spells and gain attributes.
     As you gain levels, your title changes to reflect your growing power.

Gold:
     Gold is amazingly handy, because everything stores sell can be yours with
enough of the stuff.  Characters start out with an amount of gold determined by
stats (lower is better).  Social class greatly influences starting gold (higher
is better).
     Within the Pits of Angband lies more gold than you will ever find, more
seams of treasure than you will ever dig, and more monsters carrying loot than
you will ever kill.

Hitpoints:
     Your hitpoints are your life wrapped up in a number; if they ever drop
below zero, you die.  Resting will restore hitpoints, but you should always have
some quicker way to heal yourself on hand.  Your maximum hitpoints depends on
your level, race, and class, plus a constitution bonus (which can be
considerable).

Spellpoints:
     If you use magic, you will also have spellpoints, or mana.  Your maximum
mana depends on your level and your intelligence (if you are a mage, rogue, or
ranger) or wisdom (if you are a priest or paladin).  Ways to recover mana faster
than by resting are rare and greatly desired.
     Mana goes down if you wear heavy armour.  Mages, rogues, and rangers also
lose a chunk of mana if they wear most (but not all) kinds of gloves.

Armour Class:
     Armour class (AC) makes you harder to hit in melee, and reduces the damage
you take from many (but not all) monster blows.  You can raise it by equipping
more and better armour, by increasing your Dexterity, and by activating various
temporary effects.  As time passes, you will find this value rising past 100,
even to 150 and above at very high levels.

Score:
     Your score in Angband depends on how much experience you have earned and
how deep in the dungeon you have ventured.


--- Vital Statistics ---

     You have six primary statistics, or stats.  Each of them has important
effects, and how you juggle equipment to boost some stats at the expense of
others can greatly help or hinder your adventuring.  Deep in the dungeon,
potions exist that can permanently raise your stats.

Values for stats:
     Stats range from 3 to 18/220.  The progression of stats goes from 3 -> 17,
18, 18/10, 18/20 -> 18/220.  A value of 18/19 is the same as 18/10.
     The lowest any stat can go is 3, a level that greatly reduces any abilities
that stat influences.  The lowest "safe" figure for most stats is 7, but you
can't expect any significant bonuses until the stat reaches 18 or higher.  Once
you get a stat that high, further increases will greatly enhance your abilities,
eventually making it possible to slay some truly formidable monsters.  Stats max
out at 18/220.
     Stats depend on your internal stats, the equipment you are wearing, and
various temporary conditions.

Maximize mode:
     In maximize mode, racial and class adjustments to stats are adjustments to
final stats; a Hobbit Mage can raise his internal Intelligence to 18/150, but
his strength only to 18/30.  In non-maximize mode, internal stats always rise to
18/100; racial and class adjustments only affect starting stats.
     Maximize mode (the default) is recommended in most cases.

Strength:
     Increases in Strength increase melee damage and allow you to get more blows
with heavier weapons.  It improves both your melee and missile accuracy.
Strength also improves your tunneling ability, allows you to bear more weight
without being slowed down, and to wield heavier weapons effectively.

Intelligence:
     Intelligent characters use magic devices, pick locks, and disarm traps more
effectively.
     If you are using spells, intelligence is your primary stat.  It controls
how many spells you may learn, the amount of mana you have, and your spell
failure rate.  If you are using prayers, wisdom controls all of these things.

Wisdom:
     Wise characters have a better chance of resisting magical spells cast upon
them by monsters.  Wisdom is a priest or paladin's primary stat.

Dexterity:
     Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high dexterity may
allow you to get multiple blows with lighter weapons, and will increase your
chances of hitting with melee or missile weapons.  Dexterity is also useful in
picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves
that inhabit the dungeon.

Constitution:
     Constitution determines your ability to resist physical damage, and your
rate of recovery from poison, stuns, and cuts.  It makes a great difference to
the amount of hitpoints you have and the speed at which you recover them, and so
is a vital stat for any character.

Charisma:
     Charisma represents a character's ability to influence others.  A character
with a high charisma will receive better prices from store owners, whereas a
character with a very low charisma will be robbed blind.


--- Abilities ---

     In addition to your stats, certain basic abilities define your character.
They depend on race, class, stats, and level, and may be powerfully influenced
by temporary conditions.  You can most effectively keep track of your abilities
by using the Character screen.

Saving Throw:
     The higher your saving throw, the more likely you are to resist the side
effects of monster blows and spells, traps, your own magic (when it fails), and
mental attacks.  Saving throw depends on race, class, wisdom, and level.

Stealth:
     The ability to move silently about is very useful.  If your stealth is good
enough, you can avoid fights, get in the first blow, and fight monsters one at a
time.  Stealth depends on race, class, and equipped items.

Fighting (Melee):
     The higher your melee ability, the more frequently you will hit in hand-to-
hand combat and the more critical hits you will get.  Your race, class, stats,
plusses to hit on equipped items (except for other weapons), and temporary
effects are all factored into the skill value displayed on your character
screen.  This also holds true for shooting ability.

Shooting:
     The higher your shooting ability, the more frequently you will hit with
missile weapons and the more critical hits you will get.

Disarming:
     The higher your disarming ability, the more quickly and safely you can pick
locks and disarm chests and traps.  Race, class, level, dexterity, and
intelligence all affect this ability.

Magical Devices:
     Determines how likely you are to successfully use magical devices or
activatable items.  Race, class, level, and intelligence affect this ability.
You need considerable skill to use high-level objects.

Perception:
     The better your perception, the more likely it is that you will see traps
and secret doors automatically.  Perception depends on race, class, level, and
equipped objects.
     Note that this ability has no relationship to your ability to sense
(pseudo-ID) objects.

Searching:
     The better you are at searching, the more likely it is that you will see
traps and secret doors by searching for them.  Searching depends on race, class,
level, and equipped objects (same as perception).

Infra-vision:
     The higher your infravision, the further away you can see warm-blooded
creatures, even when invisible or not lit.


--- Conditions ---

     Your character may benefit or suffer from many different conditions.  The
most important ones are displayed on the bottom row of the main screen and the
lower part of the left panel.  We describe them as they are displayed, down,
then from left to right.

     Wounds    : Instead of recovering battle damage, you take additional damage
                 every turn.
     Stunning  : Your combat and spellcasting abilities decrease.  If you are
                 too badly stunned, you can be knocked out!
     Hunger    : You need to eat every so often.  If you eat too much, you
                 become bloated and slow down.  If you eat too little, you
                 become hungry (no special effects), weak (reduced recovery),
                 feel faint (pass out every so often), and finally starve (take
                 damage every turn).
     Blindness : You cannot see most monsters, it is harder to learn about
                 objects or what's around you, and get only vague information
                 when many things happen.  You often miss monsters, and cannot
                 cast spells or read scrolls.
     Confusion : You move and attack randomly and cannot cast spells, read
                 scrolls, or use magical devices.
     Fear      : You cannot use melee combat.
     Poison    : Instead of recovering battle damage, you take additional damage
                 every turn.

State:
     You can sometimes be in one of several different states.

     Paralyzed : You cannot do ANYTHING until the effects wear off.
     Rest      : You are resting (double speed recovery of hitpoints and mana).
     Repeat    : You are repeating an action (like tunneling).
     Searching : You are searching (automatic search, but slowed speed).

Speed:
     The faster you are, the less time you take to perform all kinds of actions.
It is vital not to become too slow.  As you descend into the dungeon, you need
to find ways to hasten yourself temporarily and permanently.
     A speed of +10 is double speed ("fast"), and one of +20 is triple speed
("very fast").  A speed of 10 is half speed ("slow"), and one of -20 is one
third speed ("very slow").
     Permanent speed bonuses add to your base speed.  Temporary effects may
increase or reduce speed by 10.

Study:
     If you know magic, and can learn spells, you will see a "study" indicator
near the right-bottom of the main screen.  If you have a book available, you can
learn the spells now.

Depth:
     How deep in the dungeon you are.



====== The character screen (in detail) ======

     The character information display allows you to review attributes, change
names, and save character dumps to file.  The save character to file command
saves the character screen, character background, inventory and equipment, skill
levels, and the contents of the home.

       them

     Descriptions of abilities go from very bad -> bad -> poor -> fair -> good
-> very good -> excellent -> superb -> heroic -> legendary.


--- Attributes screen ---

     Press 'h', and your character screen displays attributes of known
(identified) equipped objects, shown under the same indexes that are used when
displaying your equipment.  The '@' lists attributes and modifiers that you
posses intrinsically.  If you are an Elf, for example, you will always resist
light.

Vital Statistics:
     The top-center of this display lists modifiers to stats.  They are light
green if the object does not also sustain that stat and green if it does.  If
the object sustains a stat without affecting it, a green 's' is displayed.

Attributes:
     The bottom of the screen displays most other non-combat attributes.  White
'+' and colored '*'s indicate the presence of the attribute.
     - Fire  : plus = resist fire, star = immunity to fire
     - Cold  : plus = resist cold, star = immunity to cold
     - Elec  : plus = resist electricity, star = immunity to electricity

     - Disen : plus = resist disenchantment
     - S.Dig : plus = slow digestion
     - Feath : plus = resist
     - PLite : plus = shining object.  +1 to total light radius
     - Regen : plus = faster regeneration of hitpoints and mana
     - Telep : plus = telepathy (see all nearby monsters with minds)
     - Invis : plus = see invisible
     - FrAct : plus = free action (no paralyzation, protection against slowing)
     - HLife : plus = hold life (you lose less to drain-exp attacks)
     - Stea. : plus = affects stealth
     - Sear. : plus = affects searching
     - Tunn. : plus = affects tunneling
     - Speed : plus = affects speed
     - Blows : plus = affects the number of melee blows you get
     - Shots : plus = affects the speed at which you fire missiles

     Any of these symbols may be changed using preference files, accessed using
the command '%'.  You may review what a symbol means by typing '/'.

     Angband can also use graphics instead of text to display your surroundings;
unfortunately, no convenient listing of them yet exists.


====== The Town ======

     You begin your adventures in the town.  It consists of eight buildings,
each with a shop entranceway, and is well populated.  The first time you are in
town it will be daytime, but the sun rises and sets as time passes.

Townspeople:
     Most townsfolk are fairly harmless.  However, there are slippery-fingered
thieves and armed killers that you need to avoid.  Fights will break out,
though, so be prepared.  Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue,
no experience is awarded for killing the town inhabitants, though you may
acquire treasure.


--- Stores ---

     You enter buildings by walking onto their entranceways, which (in text
mode) are represented by numbers from 1 to 8.
     A new display then replaces the old.  You see the name and race of the
store owner, the name of the store, and the maximum number of gold pieces that
the store owner will pay for any one item.  Below it is displayed the inventory;
if it is numerous, you may display another page by typing space.  Near the
bottom of the screen is displayed a list of commonly-used commands.
     - ESC:  leave the store.
     - 'g' or 'p': get/purchase an item.
     - 'd' or 's': drop/sell an item.
     - 'l': look at an item (display any special properties, read spellbooks)

The General Store ("1"):
     Sells foods, drinks, cloaks, torches, lamps, oil, shovels, picks, spikes,
and ammunition for missile launchers.  Buys items of these types and some
others.

The Armoury ("2"):
     Buys and sells every kind of armour.

The Weaponsmith's Shop ("3"):
     Buys and sells melee weapons, missile launchers, and ammunition.

The Temple ("4"):
     Buys and sells blunt weapons, healing and restoration supplies, prayer
books, and various other holy items.

The Alchemy Shop ("5"):
     Buys and sells potions and scrolls.

The Magic Shop ("6"):
     Buys and sells magic books, rings, amulets, wands, rods, and staffs.  Also
buys potions and scrolls.

The Black Market ("7"):
     The Black Market will buy and sell anything at extortionate prices.
However, it occasionally has VERY good items in it.  The shopkeepers are not
known for their tolerance...

Your Home ("8"):
     Here you may store objects that you cannot carry on your travels or will
need later.


--- Buying and Selling ---

The Price of Items:
     The price of items that change hands depends on their base cost, how well
your and the store owner's races get along*, your Charisma, and the innate
greediness of the store owner.  If you have the "auto_haggle" option set, you
pay an extra 10% when buying, and get 10% less when selling.

     * Everyone likes their own race best
     * Nobody else likes Half-Orcs and Half-Trolls; the feeling is mutual.
     * Elves and Dwarves are not very fond of each other; elves have better
       relations with humans than do dwarves

     If you have the "auto_haggle" option set, you simply pay the going rate.
Otherwise, you haggle for everything that isn't marked as being fixed price.

Haggling:
     If you are selling something, a typical haggling session starts with the
shopkeeper assuring you that a good price is maybe 1-25% of what the item is
really worth.  You demand many times this, and the bargaining begins.  You bring
your price closer to the shopkeeper's offer, and he then does the same for you.
The best way to change a price is to enter "-20" or "+20", instead of retyping a
new figure.  After some rounds, you and the shopkeeper will meet somewhere in
the middle.
     The key to success is to change your price neither too little (which will
insult the shopkeeper) nor too much (which is a sign of inexperience, and will
be taken advantage of).  Some shopkeepers like to haggle more, other are
impatient and demand good offers, but you have always have enough leeway to
succeed.
     Just be careful not to antagonize the shopkeepers too much; if you do, you
might be thrown out of the store, which will stay locked for maybe three or four
days.  Fortunately, shopkeepers are forgiving souls:  as time passes, they will
forget any unhappiness you've caused them.  Shopkeepers also forget an insult
every time you buy or sell anything.

Store Stocks:
     Stores never have everything in stock; as time passes, their inventory
slowly changes (but only when you are in the dungeon).  The store owner fully
identifies everything you sell him; you also become aware of objects of that
type.

Shopkeepers can retire and be replaced:
     Shopkeepers do retire, but only rarely.  The new shopkeeper has no
knowledge of your previous reputation, and no memory of any past insults.  He
puts everything in the store on sale.


====== The Dungeon ======

     All levels other than 0 (or zero feet) lie within the dungeon.  Each level
of the dungeon is fifty feet high, and is divided into large rectangular regions
(several times larger than the screen) by impenetrable walls.  Once you leave a
level, you will never again find your way back to that region of that level, but
there are an infinite number of other regions at that same depth that you can
explore later.  Monsters move about just as you do, and you may see them again.


--- Terrain ---

Rubble:
     Blocks movement, but is relatively easy to dig through.  Rubble may contain
hidden objects.

Permanent walls:
     You can dig through most walls but some are impenetrable.  The dungeon is
surrounded by these kinds of walls and some special rooms are made of them.

Staircases:
     Staircases allow your character to ascend or descend from one level to
another, and are represented by "<" (up) and ">" (down).  Each level has at
least one up staircase, and two down staircases, unless it is the home of Sauron
(level 99/4950') or Morgoth (level 100/5000'), whom you must kill before
staircases will appear.  Otherwise, the staircases are guaranteed, but they may
be difficult to find.  Once you leave a level, you can never return to it.
Watch out for spells and traps that can suddenly force you off the level.

Secret doors:
     Many secret doors exist in the dungeon, and may lead to anything from a new
section of the dungeon level to an empty closet.  As your familiarity with the
dungeon grows, you will know where many secret doors are likely to be.  Secret
doors always look like granite until found and, for historical reasons, are
never locked.

Traps:
     Traps also await you in the dungeon.  They look like normal floor squares
until found, too often by your being caught by one.
     You find secret doors and traps by using the 's'earch command.  Many
classes can also use magic and everyone can use the appropriate magical device.

Rooms:
     The Pits of Angband contain many kinds of rooms, including some that house
hordes of monsters, contain extraordinary items, or are filled with deadly
traps.  Some special rooms, known as vaults, are extremely dangerous and
lucrative.

Mining:
     There is much treasure in the walls of the dungeon, just waiting for an
industrious adventurer to come and dig it out.  Once you can afford it, and if
you can handle the weight, bring a shovel or pick along.  Your ability to tunnel
depends on strength, weapon weight, and any special digging bonus it provides.
Your success depends on these factors and the strength of the wall:  granite is
very hard, quartz is hard, magma is soft, and rubble is very soft.
     As you get richer, the treasures in the wall won't seem so appealing
anymore, but keep an item or spell of tunneling handy.  Not only do all sorts of
special vaults lie deep below the surface, some completely enclosed by solid
rock, but smart adventurers deliberately alter the dungeon to make the most
dangerous breathers and summoners manageable.


--- Exploring ---

Light:
     Your character must have some source of light in order to see, unless the
area around him is magically lit.  Depending on the items he has equipped, he
may have a light radius of one (a torch), two (a lantern), or more, up to a
rarely-attained maximum of five.  Never risk being without light.
     A torch or lantern burns fuel, and may be refilled (use the 'F'uel command)
with other torches or flasks of oil respectively.  It is rumoured that other
light sources exist which never need replenishing.
     In addition you may get access to spells which permanently light up areas
of the dungeon; these can be truly handy, because a monster you can see coming
is much less dangerous.

Food and Regeneration:
     Never risk being without food.  You must eat every so often in order to
avoid starvation.  The speed at which you consume food depends on your race
(trolls need to eat a lot) and the items you wear.
     The speed at which you regenerate is doubled when you are resting (so rest
in place instead of staying in place whenever possible), and is also affected by
various object attributes and temporary conditions.

Stealth:
     The higher your stealth, and the further away you are, the less you disturb
the rest of sleeping monsters.

Searching and Detection:
     There are two ways to find hidden areas of the dungeon, doors, traps,
objects, and monsters; manual searching and magic.  At the beginning of the
game, you find everything manually.  If you suspect the existence of secret
doors or traps, press 's' to search the grids around you for one turn.  Later
on, you get access to objects and spells that do this for you, and very handy
they are.

Level Feelings:
     If you have spent enough time on the previous level, you will get a feeling
when you enter another one.  The more interesting the choice of adjectives, the
more dangerous and lucrative the level is likely to be.
     Things that boost level feelings include:  out of depth monsters, out of
depth uniques, out of depth objects, certain powerful object kinds, and very
special rooms.

Preserve Mode:
     If you do not have preserve mode on, you will occasionally get the message
"You feel there is something special about this level.", indicating the presence
of a monster pit or nest, a vault, or an artifact.
     However, turning preserve mode off also means that artifacts are created
only once; they will never appear again.  You can check the artifacts that have
been found or lost by using the knowledge '~' menu.


--- The Passage of Time ---

     Both monsters and characters gain energy each turn and use it to perform
actions.  Any creature that moves at normal speed gains 10 energy per game turn;
any monster move and most character actions take 100 energy.  Some monsters move
at double speed and you can too, if you quaff a Potion of Speed.  Actions still
take the same amount of energy, but they and you gain twice the energy each
turn.  Further down, monsters lurk that move even faster, and rare items exist
that enable you to keep pace.  If you can, avoid being slower than your foes.

An abbreviated speed-to-energy table:

(very slow creatures can get as little as 1 energy per turn)
     -20 speed:  3 energy
     -15      :  4
     -10      :  5
      -5      :  6
     normal   : 10
      +5      : 15
     +10      : 20
     +15      : 25
     +20      : 30
     +25      : 35
     +30      : 38 (energy only goes up very slowly above +30 speed)

Regeneration and recovery:
     Every 10 game turns, you regenerate some hitpoints and mana (unless you are
ill or wounded), and get hurt by cuts and poison.  Temporary conditions count
down, rods recharge, and light sources use fuel.  Every 100 game turns, you
digest some food.  Every hundred thousand game turns equals one day; the town
spends half that time in darkness and the other half in light.
     Every time it takes a turn, every monster aware of you recovers from
temporary conditions.  Every 100 game turns, they regenerate hitpoints.



====== Objects ======

     The mines far below the surface are full of objects just waiting to be
picked up and used.  The treasures of long-forgotten kingdoms, dragon's hordes,
heirlooms, wizard's stashes, and the plunder from every age of the world unite
with the scattered earthly possessions of all the foolish adventurers who died
before you to offer unimaginable wealth for those bold enough to seize it.


--- Learning about objects ---

Learning about objects:
     When you begin the game, most objects are unknown to you, and an important
task is to learn more about them so that you can use them reliably.  The
standard way to learn about an object is to identify it, but scrolls of Identify
and Staffs of Perception are too expensive to use on everything.

Full identification:
     Some items have special powers.  Ego-item descriptions usually tell you
everything, but artifacts are known only by legend.  To learn absolutely
everything about an object, read a scroll of *identify* on it.  Such scrolls are
rare and expensive; if you don't have access to one, try using the object a lot
and inscribing it.

Scanning wargear automatically (Pseudo-ID):
     Every so often, you automatically scan un-identified wargear (weapons and
armour).  If you learn something, the item is inscribed.

     Item description               weak sensing            strong sensing
     average item:                  (no inscription)        "average"
     item with plusses              "good"                  "good"
     ego-item (weapon of flame)     "good"                  "excellent"
     artifact (unique item)         "good"                  "special"
     cursed artifact                "cursed"                "terrible"
     cursed ego-item                "cursed"                "worthless"
     cursed ordinary object         "cursed"                "cursed"


--- Object information ---

     'I'nspecting a specific object will pop up a special display that may tell
you useful things about it.  If the item is fully identified, you see all of its
attributes.
     Known attributes of equipped items are displayed in the character screen
display (type 'C' to bring up the character screen, then press 'h' to cycle
through the information).  This interface is helpful when you want to optimize
your equipment.


--- Inventory and equipment ---

Your inventory (backpack) and equipment (your person):
     You pick up objects by moving on top on them or staying still (if you have
the "auto_pickup" option on), or by using the 'g'et command (if you don't).  You
may carry up to 23 different items or piles of items, and have 12 areas of your
body where wearable equipment may go.  Press 'i', and you see the contents of
your backpack; press 'e' and you see what you are wearing.  Both listings toggle
open and closed when you press the space key.  Items on the floor display in
similar fashion if you have the "easy_floor" option set.
     When choosing items, you switch between inventory and equipment by pressing
'/', and switch between the floor and either of these two by pressing '-'.

Burden:
     Carry too much weight, and you will begin to slow down, making it easier
for monsters to kill you.  The point at which your load thus hinders you depends
on your strength.

Floor items:
     If objects are allowed to stack (which they are by default), up to 23
objects or piles of objects may stack in a single floor grid.


--- Object types ---

Magical devices:
     Wands and staffs with equal numbers of charges stack; otherwise, they
don't.  Rods stack when fully charged.

Chests:
     Chests are difficult and dangerous to open, as they usually contain both
traps and locks.  If you succeed, you may be rewarded handsomely.

Scroll of Word of Recall:
     The Scroll of Word of Recall deserves special mention.  Read in the
dungeon, it brings you back to the town.  Read in the town, it takes you back to
your previous recall depth.  This spell takes a little time to take effect, so
don't expect it to save you in a crisis.  Should you mistakenly read a Scroll of
Word of Recall, you may cancel it by reading another.
     If you read this scroll above your current recall depth, you get a special
message asking you if you want to reset it.  If you say yes, the level you are
on becomes the new recall depth.

Ego-Weapons and Armours:
     Some rare weapons and armours have special abilities.  These are called ego
items, and are feared by great and meek.

Dragon Scale Mails:
     These extremely rare pieces of armour come in many different colors, each
protecting you against the relevant dragons.  They also occasionally allow you
to breathe as dragons do!

Artifacts:
     There are rumors of incredibly rare, unique artifacts which are even more
powerful than ego items.  Some artifacts are standard, and you may already know
of their fame, while others will certainly be unfamiliar to you and will need to
be fully identified (*identified*).  Artifacts cannot be destroyed, although
they can be disenchanted.


--- Object enhancement ---

     Weapons and armour may have bonuses to hit chance, damage, and armour
class; it can be very useful indeed to increase these values by reading scrolls
of Enchant Weapon and Enchant Armour.
     - The higher the plusses are, the harder it is to raise them further.  It
       is especially difficult to raise them above 9 or 10.
     - The larger the pile of objects you try to enchant, the more likely it is
       that you will fail.  However, ammunition is unusually easy to enchant.
     - You can sometimes break curses on objects by enchanting them.


--- Object destruction ---

     Objects may be damaged or destroyed on the floor, in your backpack, and
(sometimes) even damaged while you are wearing them.

     - Acid destroys armour, weapons, missile launchers, ammunition, scrolls,
       staffs, and chests.  It may damage equipped armour that does not ignore
       acid.
     - Electricity destroys rings, amulets, and wands.
     - Fire destroys torches, arrows, missile launchers, hafted weapons and
       polearms, gloves, boots, cloaks, shields, soft body armour, spellbooks,
       scrolls, staffs, and chests.
     - Frost, sound, and shards destroy potions and empty bottles.

     - Equipped items with plusses can be disenchanted.
     - Wands and staffs can be destroyed by failed recharges.


--- Cursed Objects ---

     Many cursed items exist in the Pits -- either left behind as the result of
failed attempts to create magic items, or deliberately placed by gleeful evil
sorcerers who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.
     These horrible objects look perfectly innocent, but will detract from your
character's stats or abilities if worn.  You cannot remove them without breaking
the curse first.  In fact, some are so badly cursed that even this will not
work, and more potent methods are needed.
     If you wear or wield a cursed item, you will immediately feel deathly cold,
and the item will be marked "cursed".
     Shopkeepers will refuse to buy any item that is known to be cursed.



====== Monsters ======


Monsters are worth experience:
     Defeat a monster, and you will gain experience.  The amount you gain
depends on the base monster value, multiplied by its native depth, divided by
your level.

Your Monster Memory:
     When you see a monster for the first time, all you know are its physical
attributes and whatever information the monster description may provide.  As you
fight and kill monsters, use various attacks on them, probe them with magic, and
get killed by them, you learn more about their strengths and weaknesses.
     You recall this memory in one of two ways:  'l'ooking at/e'x'amining the
monster and then pressing 'r' for recall, or by pressing '/' and typing the
monster's letter.
     Unlike object memory, monster memory can be passed on even after your
character dies.  You may use menu commands or command-line options to open up a
specific file that contains a character with a monster memory.

The Monster Health Bar:
     A good way to keep track of a specific monster is to target it.  When you
do so, its health bar appears on the left side of the main screen, just below
the hitpoint and mana indicators.  Similar health bars are also used when
looking around and when displaying the closest monsters.
     The health bar uses several colors to tell you more about the monster.
Frightened - violet, Confused - brown, Stunned - light blue, Sleeping - dark
blue, Otherwise - green when healthy, and yellow, orange, and red when wounded.

Monster attributes:
     The special attributes of monsters can make all the difference to the
danger they pose to you.  Some of the more interesting are listed and described.

     - Hitpoints : Some monsters die easily, others can withstand almost
       anything.
     - Armour : Some monsters are easy to hit with melee blows or missiles,
       others evade or block them quite often.
     - Awareness : Some monsters will stay asleep even if you dance in front of
       them, others are ever vigilant.  The distance that monsters can
       perceive you (if you are not in line of sight) also varies greatly.

     - Color : The color of a monster can be a valuable hint.
     - Multi-hued : Changes colors randomly.
     - Invisible : Cannot be seen with normal sight.
     - Warm-blooded : Some monsters can be seen with infravision, others can't.
     - Telepathy : Some monsters are always visible with telepathy, others are
       rarely visible, and others still never visible.
     - Uses symbol : Appears exactly like whatever terrain it is on.

     - Groups : Monsters may appear in groups, or have escorts.
     - Multiply : Monster breeds explosively.

     - Drops : Monsters may drop anything from nothing at all to many excellent
       objects.
     - Experience : The experience you get from killing monsters varies greatly.

     - Bash Door : Most monsters (but not all) can either bash down or open
       doors.  Everyone can close doors, and some characters can spike doors to
       delay their foes.
     - Pass Wall : Ghosts and some other creatures can float right through
       ordinary walls.

     - Hurt by ... : Monsters may be especially susceptible to light or rock
       remover.
     - Resistant to ... : Monsters can be especially resistant to any or all of
       the elements or poison, or any of the esoteric magics.
     - Cannot be ... : Monsters may be immune to fear, slowing, stunning,
       sleeping, or confusion.
     - Regenerate : Recovers battle damage unusually quickly.

     - Spells : Monsters may fire physical missiles, breathe, cast spells to
       hurt and hinder you, blink and teleport you and themselves, heal them-
       selves, haste themselves or other monsters, summon more opponents,
       and many other things!
     - Casting speed : Be careful of monsters that cast spells very often,
       especially if they also move quickly.
     - Smart : Monsters may be skilled at choosing spells, somewhat skilled, or
       unskilled
     - Breath Powerfully : Dragon breaths have a larger blast radius.

     - Blows : Monsters can do great damage and inflict nasty effects in melee.

====== Basic Command Information ======

Canceling a Command:
     Virtually all commands can be canceled at any point before execution by
hitting the ESC key.

Command Counts:
     Any command that can be repeated, or that can manipulate more than one
object, can take a count.  By default, most that do are automatically given a
count of 99.  Although most commands that usually need a quantity will ask for
one, for other commands a quantity is only sometimes desired.  Hence command
counts.  For example, to tunnel into a wall exactly 50 times, you would type a
zero ("0"), then "50", followed by a return.  Then use the tunnel command.  All
commands that use quantities will stop if you are disturbed, accomplish your
intended task, hit any key, or when the count expires.

Doing More with Less Effort:
     The section on making macros describes how to:
     - quickly switch to a shovel or backup weapon,
     - fire a missile or cast commonly used spells with a single keystroke,
     - prevent accidental use of valuable equipment,
     - and many other things

Interfaces:
     See the "interfaces" section for more details about powerful and complex
commands.



====== Command Descriptions ======

     Command names are followed by one or two characters:  the first is that
used in the original keyset; the second, that used in the roguelike keyset (if
different).


--- Movement Commands ---

Stay still -- with normal pickup (,) / (.) :
     Stay in the same square for one move.  If you normally pick up objects you
encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on.  You may also use the
"5" key (both keysets).  This command takes a full turn.

Stay still -- flip pickup (g) :
     Stay in the same square for one move.  Pick up objects if you do not do so
automatically.  This command takes a full turn.

Walk -- with normal pickup (;) :
     This command activates every time you press a direction key; it moves you
one step in the given direction.  This command takes a full turn.

Walk -- flip pickup (-) :
     Walk.  If you normally pick things up, don't.  Otherwise, do.  This command
takes a full turn.

Run (.) / (,) :
     This command is very useful for rapid dungeon exploration.  It will move
you in the given direction, following any bends in the corridor, until you
either have to make a choice between two directions or are disturbed.  Most
players run by holding down Shift and pressing a direction key.

Go up staircase (<) :
     Ascend an up staircase.  Going up a staircase will take you to a new
dungeon level unless you are at 50 feet (level 1), in which case you will return
to the town.  This command takes a full turn.

Go down staircase (>) :
     Descend a down staircase.  Going down a staircase will take you to a new
dungeon level.  This command takes a full turn.


--- Object Commands ---

Inventory list (i) :
     Display a list of objects in your backpack.

Equipment list (e) :
     Display a list of objects you are currently wielding, wearing, or otherwise
have immediately to hand.

Drop an item (d) :
     Drop an item from your inventory or equipment onto the floor.  If the grid
you are standing on has objects in it already, or cannot hold objects, the
object will end up nearby.  Be warned that if the floor is very full, and you
attempt to drop something, it may disappear and be destroyed.  This command
takes half a turn.

Destroy an item (k) / (Ctrl-D) :
     Destroy an object in your inventory or on the dungeon floor.  If the
"verify destroy" option is ON, you must verify this command.  This command takes
a full turn.

Wear/Wield equipment (w) :
     Wear or wield an object in your inventory or from the floor.  Since only
one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield an item into a
slot that is already occupied, the old item will first be taken off.  If there
is no room in your inventory, it drops to the floor.  This command takes a full
turn.

Take off equipment (t) / (T) :
     Take off a (uncursed) piece of equipment and return it to your inventory.
If there is no room in your inventory for the item, your pack will overflow and
you will drop the item after taking it off.  This command takes half a turn.

Switch primary and secondary weapon (X) :
     Exchange whatever weapon you have wielded with the first weapon in your
inventory inscribed {@0} or {@w0}.  This is very handy for swapping in and out
shovels.  This command takes a full turn.

Inscribe an object ({) :
     Inscribe an object.  The inscription appears inside curly braces after the
object description.  The inscription is limited to the particular object (or
pile) and is not automatically transferred to all similar objects, unless the
"Merge Inscriptions when Stacking" option is on.

Uninscribe an object (}) :
     Remove the inscription on an object.  This command will have no effect on
inscriptions added by the game itself (such as "{cursed}").


--- Object Usage Commands ---

Eat some food (E) :
     Eat some food or a mushroom.  This command takes a full turn.

Fuel your lantern/torch (F) :
     You can refuel lanterns with flasks of oil and torches with other torches.
In general, two flasks will fully fuel a lantern and two torches will fully fuel
a torch.  This command takes half a turn.

Quaff a potion (q) :
     Drink a potion.  This command takes a full turn.

Read a scroll (r) :
     Read a scroll.  Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be
aborted (by pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll before it
disintegrates.  This command takes a full turn.

Activate an object (A) :
     You have heard rumours of special wearable items deep in the Pits, ones
that can let you breath fire like a dragon or light rooms with just a thought.
Should you ever be lucky enough to find such an item, this command will let you
activate its special power.  This command takes a full turn.

Aim a wand (a) / (z) :
Use a staff (u) / (Z) :
Zap a rod (z) / (a) :
     Uses the indicated kind of magical device.  This command takes a full turn.


--- Dungeon and Object Alteration Commands ---

Tunnel (T) / (Ctrl-T) :
     Dig through barriers, mine treasure found in wall seams, and otherwise
alter the dungeon to your liking.  This command may take a count and requires a
full turn.

Open a door or chest (o) :
     Open a door or chest.  If locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based
on your disarming ability.  If you open a trapped chest without disarming the
traps first, they will activate.  Some doors will be jammed shut and may have to
be bashed open.  This command takes a full turn.
     You may set the "easy_open" option to open doors that you walk into.

Close a door (c) :
     Close a door.  Some monsters cannot open doors, so shutting them can be
quite useful.  Broken doors cannot be closed.  This command takes a full turn.

Jam a door (j) / (S) :
     Jam a door (so that it needs to be bashed down).  Many monsters can simply
open closed doors, and can eventually get through a locked door.  You may
therefore occasionally want to jam a door shut with iron spikes.  Each spike
used on the door will make it harder to bash down the door, up to a limit of
eight.  This command takes a full turn.

Bash a door (B) / (f) :
     Bash down jammed doors.  Your door bashing ability increases with strength.
Bashing open a door can (briefly) throw you off balance and sometimes ruins the
door.  All doors can be bashed; jammed or spiked doors will not open any other
way.  This command takes a full turn.

Disarm a trap or chest (D) :
     You can attempt to disarm known traps on the floor or on chests.  If you
fail, there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off.  This command
takes a full turn.

Alter (+) :
     This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select any of
the dungeon alteration commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open, disarm,
close), and, by using macros or keymaps, to combine this keypress with
directions.  This command takes a full turn.


--- Special Action Commands ---

Rest (R) :
     You recover from wounds twice as quickly by resting than by repeatedly
staying still.  This command can be told to stop automatically after a certain
amount of time, or when various conditions are met.  In either case, you always
wake up when anything disturbs you, or when you press any key.
     After typing 'R', use "*" to rest until your hitpoints and mana are
restored, and "&" to rest until you are fully "healed".  This command may accept
a command count (used for the number of turns to rest), and takes a full turn.

Search (s) :
     Search for hidden traps and secret doors adjacent to you.  More than a
single turn of searching will be required in most cases.  This command can take
a count, which is useful if you are confident of finding something eventually,
since the command stops as soon as anything is found.  This command takes a full
turn.

Turn searching mode on and off (S) :
     In searching mode, you search every time you move.  You therefore move more
slowly.  Search mode will automatically turn off if you are disturbed.


--- Spell and Prayer Commands ---

Browse a book (b) / (P) :
     Open a readable book and read the spells or prayer in it, learning
information such as their level, cost to cast, etc.  This command takes no time.

Gain new spells or prayers (G) :
     When you are able to learn new spells or prayers, the word "Study" will
appear on the status line at the bottom of the screen.  You then issue this
command and choose a book with unlearnt magics.  Priests and Paladins get a
prayer at random; other magic-using classes may choose.  This command takes a
full turn.

Cast a spell or Pray a prayer (m and p) :
     Cast a known spell or prayer.  This command takes a full turn.


--- Throwing and Missile Weapons ---

Fire an item (f) / (t) :
     You may fire ammunition if you are wielding a missile weapon that uses it.
See the non-magical combat section for more information.  This command takes a
full turn, unless you get extra shots.

Throw an item (v) :
     You may throw any object carried by your character.  See the non-magical
combat section for more information.  This command takes a full turn.

Targeting (*) :
     Aim directly at a specific monster or grid.  See the interfaces section for
more information.


--- Information Commands ---

Help (?) :
     Brings up the on-line help system.

Observe an object (I) :
     Display extra information about a specific object, especially if you have
fully identified it.  This command takes no time.

Character Description (C) :
     Display extra information about your character.  From this screen, you can
change names, review attributes, or save your character information ("character
dumps") to file.

Look around (l) / (x) :
     Look around at nearby monsters (to determine their type, health, and
carried objects) and objects (to determine their type).  This command can also
be used to find out what objects (if any) are under monsters, what terrain a
monster is in, and what is under the character.  See the interfaces section for
more information.  This command takes no time.

Check knowledge (~) :
     This command allows you to review what you know about artifacts, unique
monsters, and objects.

Identify Symbol (/) :
     Find out what a character represents.  For instance, by pressing '/', then
'.', you will learn that the "." symbol stands for a floor.
     If you ask about a type of monsters, such as 'r' - rodents, and you have
knowledge of any, the game will offer to show monster recall.  Type 'y' to
display an unsorted list, 'p' to list by monster level, 'k' to list by number of
kills, and any other key to cancel.
     You may also use this command to ask about all monsters (type Control-A),
unique monsters (Control-U), or non-unique monsters (Control-N).
     This command takes no time.

Full screen map (M) :
     Show a map of the entire dungeon on screen.  Only the major dungeon
features will be visible because of the scale, so even some important things may
not show up.  This command is particularly useful in locating where the stairs
are relative to your current position, or for identifying unexplored areas of
the dungeon.  This command takes no time.

Locate player on map (L) / (W) :
     This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors of the
current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point the map will be
re-centered on the player if necessary.  To scroll the map around, press any of
the direction keys.  The top line will display the sector location, and the
offset from your current sector.  This command takes no time.

Game Version (V) :
     Learn what version of the game you are playing.


--- Message Commands ---

Repeat level feeling (Ctrl-F) :
     Displays your feeling about the dungeon level.  This command takes no time.

View previous messages (Ctrl-P) :
     Shows you all the recent messages.  You can scroll through them or exit
with ESCAPE.  This command takes no time.

View previous message (Ctrl-O) :
     Shows you the most recent message.  This command takes no time.

Take notes (:) :
     Allows you to take notes, which will then appear in your message list
(prefixed with "Note:").  This command takes no time.


--- Saving and Exiting Commands ---

Save and Quit (Ctrl-X) :
     Save your character to file and exits the game.

Save (Ctrl-S) :
     Save the game but don't exit it.  Use this frequently if you are paranoid
about having your computer crash (or your power go out) while you are playing.

Quit (commit suicide) (Q or Ctrl-K) :
     Kill or retire your character and exit the game.  You will be prompted to
make sure you really want to do this, and then asked to verify that choice.
Note that dead characters are dead forever.
     This is also how you retire after slaying Morgoth.

--- Special Notes ---

Special Keys:
     Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results.  In general, these special keys are control
keys; often you can disable their special effects.

     It is often possible to specify "control-keys" without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret ("^") followed by the key.  This is useful
for specifying control-key commands that might be caught by the operating
system.

     Pressing backslash ("\") before a command will bypass all keymaps, and the
next keypress will be interpreted as an underlying command key.  The backslash
key is useful for creating macro actions which are not affected by any keymap
definitions that may be in force.  For example, the three-character sequence
"\.6" will always mean "run east", even if the "." key has been mapped to a
different underlying command.

UNIX-specific notes:
     If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-C will interrupt
the game.  The second and third interrupt will induce a warning bell, and the
fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message, since the fifth
will quit the game, after killing your character.  Also, Ctrl-Z will suspend the
game, and return you to the original command shell, until you resume the game
with the "fg" command.  There is now a compilation option to force the game to
prevent the "double ctrl-z escape death trick".  The Ctrl-\ and Ctrl-D and Ctrl-
S keys should not be intercepted.

Window-specific notes:
     If you playing on Windows, you may need to turn off num lock in order to
run.  If you are playing a IBM port under Windows, and see what appear to be
very strange colors, right-click on the executable, go to "Program Properties ->
Screen -> Usage, and make sure that the program runs in full-screen mode.



====== Interfaces ======


Conventions:
     When you have entered most game interfaces, you can expect certain sub-
commands to do logical things, if appropriate.
     ?)      Displays help on the command or interface you are using.
     escape) Cancels the last action, or exits and saves changes, as described
             by the help text.
     return) Accepts the current choice, or exits and saves changes.  Is also
             used asa way to advance one line.
     space)  Advance a page in a list, or advance one list item.  Sometimes
             toggles choices.
     8, -)   Move up
     2, +)   Move down
     4)      Move left
     6)      Move right

Navigating help and scrolling through similar documents:
     The main help pages list the most commonly-used commands, but there are
others that you may find helpful.
     escape) exit out of all displayed files
     ?)      return to the previous displayed file.  If there is no previous
             file, exit.

     #)      go to a specific line
     %)      display a specific file (in "lib/help" or "lib/info")


--- Objects ---

Walking over objects, Picking them up:
     If the "auto_pickup" option is ON, you normally pick objects up whenever
you stay still or move.  If "carry_query_flag" is also ON, you will be prompted;
otherwise, you pick up the objects automatically.
     If the "auto_pickup" option is OFF, you do not pick up any object unless
you type 'g', or type '-' and move.

Selecting Objects:
     You may select objects in your backpack (your inventory), on your person
(your equipment), or on the floor underneath you.
     space, *) Display or hide a list
     /)        Toggle between inventory and backpack
     -)        Use objects on the floor
     a-z)      Select the object with that index letter
     A-Z)      Select the same object, but only once you verify your choice
     0-9)      Select a specific object (if inscribed)


-- Targeting ---

The Targeting command:
     The target command ('*') makes it possible to set up a location or fix a
monster as the point which you want future missiles and spells to aim for.  Some
other commands also allow use of the targeting interface (normally by typing
'*').  However you begin targeting, you have a number of options available to
you.
     escape, q)  Exit targeting mode.  Cancel target.
     p)          Return to the player.
     o)          Start looking at all grids (exact control).
     m)          Start looking only at monsters (if any monsters are around).
     +)          Look at next monster or interesting grid.
     -)          Look at previous monster or interesting grid.
     r)          (If cursor is on a monster) recall monster information.
     t)          Target grid or monster.
     space)      See monster's carried objects (if looking).
     return)     Continue looking.

     If you have the "use old target by default" option on, be careful about
clearing targets on the floor when done.



====== Options ======

Various concepts mentioned below:
     "disturb"    : cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands
     "flush"      : forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue,
                    including any macros in progress
     "fresh"      : dump any pending output to the screen

Options you may want to change to your preferences include:
     - Roguelike commands, if you are used to the commands used in certain other
       roguelike games, or have no number pad.
     - Checking that the hitpoint warning is non-zero can save your character's
       life.
     - Set the delay factor to two or more, and turn ON "fresh_before", if you
       want to see pretty ball explosions and whatnot.
     - Playing around with the lighting options in the Display Options section
       can be a lot of fun.

Saving options:
     Options are saved in your character's savefile, but you may want to use the
same options for other characters too.  Whenever you save options, you have
essentially four choices of filenames:
     - <<savefile name>>.prf  : affects only that character
     - <<race name>>.prf      : affects all characters of that race
     - <<class name>>.prf     : affects all characters of that class
     - user.prf               : affects all of your characters

     These rules also apply to other kinds of preferences.


--- Option Set #1:  User Interface ---

Rogue-like commands                           [rogue_like_commands]  (off) :
     Selects the "roguelike" command set, which uses eight of the letter keys to
move the character about.  This command set can be really useful if you have no
number pad, and some people just naturally prefer it.  However, the original
command set has considerably more unused keys available for macros and keymaps.

Activate quick messages                       [quick_messages]       (on) :
     Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt.
Allows most keys to mean "no" to any "[y/n]" prompt.  Usage of this option can
be dangerous!

Prompt for floor item selection               [floor_query_flag]     (off) :
     Allows you to choose any item in a floor stack, even if you do not have
"easy_floor" on.

Prompt before picking things up               [carry_query_flag]     (on) :
    Forces the game to ask your permission before allowing you to pick up any
object.  Usually turned on if "auto_pickup" is also ON.  If it is OFF, usage of
this option is normally not necessary.

Use old target by default                     [use_old_target]       (off) :
     Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the current
target if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous if you target
locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

Pick things up by default                     [always_pickup]        (on) :
    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it up.
Picking up objects this way takes no additional energy.  Note the "g" and "-"
commands, which can be used to reverse this option for a single turn, and the
option "carry_query_flag", which lets you decide whether to pick things up.

Repeat obvious commands                       [always_repeat]        (off) :
     The tunneling, altering, resting, disarming, opening, closing, and bashing
commands will repeat 99 times unless you explicitly give a different command
count.

Merge inscriptions when stacking              [stack_force_notes]    (off) :
     Allows objects with and without inscriptions to stack, retaining any
inscription.

Merge discounts when stacking                 [stack_force_costs]    (off) :
     Allows objects with greater and lesser discounts to stack, retaining the
larger discount.

Audible bell (on errors, etc)                 [ring_bell]            (on) :
     Make a bell sound when errors occur (such as typing an invalid key).

Open/Disarm/Close without direction           [easy_open]            (off) :
     When you issue the open, close, or disarm commands, and there is only one
useable door or visible trap adjacent to you, it is selected automatically.

Open/Disarm doors/traps on movement           [easy_alter]           (off) :
     When you move into a door, you attempt to open it.  When you move into a
trap, you attempt to disarm it.

Display floor stacks in a list                [easy_floor]           (off) :
     Displays items on the floor using a list similar to that used for
inventory.  Allows you to comfortably handle large piles of floor items.

Scroll map while targetting                   [scroll_target]        (off) :
     When looking or targeting, the panel will shift as needed, allowing you to
review everything you know about the dungeon.


--- Option Set #2:  Disturbance ---

When running, ignore stairs                   [run_ignore_stairs]    (on) :
     Ignore stairs when running.

When running, ignore doors                    [run_ignore_doors]     (on) :
     Ignore open doors when running.

When running, cut corners                     [run_cut_corners]      (on) :
     Cut sharply around known corners when running.  This will result in faster
running (which matters if you are fleeing), but may cause you to run into a
lurking monster.

When running, use corners                     [run_use_corners]      (on) :
     Fully examine potential corners in corridors.  Activates only in special
cases.

Disturb whenever any monster moves            [disturb_move]         (on) :
     Disturb the player when any visible monster moves, appears, or disappears,
whether in line of sight or out of it.  This increases safety, but may cause
trouble when you have telepathy and are trying to rest.

Disturb whenever viewable monster moves       [disturb_near]         (on) :
     Disturb the player when any viewable (visible and in direct line of sight)
monster moves, whenever any monster becomes viewable, and whenever any viewable
monster becomes no longer viewable.
     It is recommended that you leave this option on; not doing so may cause you
to be ambushed by monsters you can easily see.

Disturb whenever map panel changes            [disturb_panel]        (on) :
     Disturbs you when the map panel shifts.  This slows down your exploration,
but makes it easier to avoid leaving a detected area.

Disturb whenever player state changes         [disturb_state]        (on) :
     This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state changes,
including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

Disturb whenever boring things happen         [disturb_minor]        (on) :
     Disturbs you when you sense wargear automatically (pseudo-ID), hear a door
being bashed open, or begin to run out of fuel.

Verify destruction of objects                 [verify_destroy]       (on) :
     Gives you an "are you sure" message when you try to destroy an object.

Verify use of special commands                [verify_special]       (on) :
     Asks if you are certain before entering wizard, debug, or borg mode (if
allowed).

Allow quantity specification                  [allow_quantity]       (on) :
     Prompt for a quantity when necessary, instead of defaulting to a single
object.  If you prefer to enter command counts before commands instead of typing
quantities when prompted, turn this option off.

Automatically clear '-more-' prompts          [auto_more]            (off) :
     The game does not wait for a keypress when it comes to a -more- prompt, but
erases the message instead.  This may speed up play, but can cause you to miss
important warnings or interesting occurrences if you do not have an extra window
devoted to message recall.


--- Option Set #3:  Game-Play ---

Auto-haggle in stores                         [auto_haggle]          (on) :
     Causes you to accept the prices the shopkeeper asks or offers.  Usage of
this option causes you to pay 10% more than normal when buying, and get 10% less
when selling.

Auto-scum for good levels                     [auto_scum]            (off) :
     Regenerates dungeon levels until one is found with enough dangerous
monsters and nifty objects.  Usage of this option makes for more intense but
dangerous games.

Expand the power of the look command          [expand_look]          (on) :
    Expand the look command to allow the user to inspect grids which are not
actually in view of the player, allowing the examination of objects/monsters
which have only been detected by spells, or sensed via telepathy.

Expand the power of the list commands         [expand_list]          (on) :
    Allows the targeting interface to cycle through all appropriate grids, and
your monster recall to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.

Map remembers all perma-lit grids             [view_perma_grids]     (on) :
     Memorize all permanently lit floor grids.  Turning this option off allows
you to know which lit floor grids are in line of sight.  If you are using color,
however, the "view_bright_lite" option works better.

Map remembers all torch-lit grids             [view_torch_grids]     (off) :
     Memorize all floor grids that have ever been lit up by the player.  This is
one way to help keep track of which areas you have explored.

Generate dungeons with aligned rooms          [dungeon_align]        (on) :
     Aligns rooms to 11x33 blocks (as opposed to 11x11 ones).  This makes it
less likely that a room will continue past the current panel view, but reduces
the number of large rooms (greater vaults in particular).

Generate dungeons with connected stairs       [dungeon_stair]        (on) :
     When entering a level using a staircase, it remains in place.  This allows
you to beat a hasty retreat if necessary.

Monsters chase current location (v.slow)      [flow_by_sound]        (off) :
     Allows monsters to navigate around obstacles between you and them.  This
option will substantially slow down the game on older machines, but makes
monsters behave much more intelligently.

Monsters chase recent locations (v.slow)      [flow_by_smell]        (off) :
     Allows monsters to track you down by following your footsteps.  The same
comments apply here.

Monsters behave more intelligently            [smart_monsters]       (off) :
     Monsters choose spells depending on tactical situation (for example, they
are more likely to use a healing spell when badly wounded).  They breath less
often (sometimes much less often), but cast spells almost twice as frequently.
They do not cast bolt spells if another monster blocks the way, and can find
hiding places to run away to.

Monsters act smarter in groups (v.slow)       [smart_packs]          (off) :
     Monster packs attempt to ambush the character.  Monster groups are better
at surrounding him.

Monsters learn from their mistakes            [smart_learn]          (off) :
     Allows monsters to learn about your resistances by observation, and to use
this knowledge to avoid making further mistakes.

Monsters exploit players weaknesses           [smart_cheat]          (off) :
     Monsters instantly know all your resistances, and need spend no time
learning.


--- Option Set #4:  Efficiency ---

Reduce lite-radius when running               [view_reduce_lite]     (off) :
     When running, your light radius is reduced to one.  Not recommended for use
unless your machine is very slow.

Hide player symbol when running               [hidden_player]        (off) :
     Saves a small amount of time by not refreshing your symbol when running.
Again, makes little difference except on very slow machines.

Avoid checking for user abort                 [avoid_abort]          (off) :
     Avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting or
running or repeated commands.  On some system, this makes the game more
efficient, but on others (including most graphical ones) it can be troublesome.
Resting for long periods of time with this option set is dangerous since the
resting may not stop until the user takes damage from starvation.

Avoid processing special colors               [avoid_other]          (off) :
     Forbids multi-hued monsters to shimmer and makes clear monsters appear
white.  May increase speed on some older machines.

Flush input on various failures               [flush_failure]        (on) :
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
failures occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand, etc.
This is very useful if you use macros that include directional components with
commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from walking towards monsters
when your spells fail.

Flush input whenever disturbed                [flush_disturb]        (off) :
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
character is disturbed.  This is useful if you use macros that take time, since
it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being attacked by a
monster.

Flush output before every command             [fresh_before]         (on) :
     Refresh the screen before commands, which gives you much more information
but slows down the game slightly.  You must turn this option on to see spell
effects.

Flush output after various things             [fresh_after]          (off) :
     This option forces the game to flush all output not only after every player
command, but also after every round of processing monsters and objects, and
after every message.  This maximizes your information, but may slow down the
game (especially on slower machines) and on faster machines you cannot see the
results anyway.

Compress messages in savefiles                [compress_savefile]    (on) :
     Compress the savefile, saving only the most recent player messages.  This
can cut the size of the savefile substantially, but will result in the loss of
message information.


--- Option Set #5:  Display ---

Show dungeon level in feet                    [depth_in_feet]        (off) :
     Displays dungeon level in feet, as opposed to level.

Show labels in equipment listings             [show_labels]          (on) :
    Display "labels" (what an object is being used for) for objects in all
equipment listings.

Show weights in all object listings           [show_weights]         (on) :
     Display weights (in pounds) of objects in all inventory, equipment, store,
and home listings.

Show choices in inven/equip windows           [show_choices]         (on) :
    Display choices (legal responses) in any sub-windows that are being used to
display your inventory or equipment.  Also, if one sub-window is being used to
display your inventory or equipment, then this option will cause it to be
(temporarily) toggled as needed.

Show details in monster descriptions          [show_details]         (on) :
     Display a description and number of kills for each monster in the monster
recall.

Show flavors in object descriptions           [show_flavors]         (on) :
     Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object descriptions and information
screens, even for objects whose type is known.  This does not affect objects in
stores.

Hilite the player with the cursor             [hilite_player]        (off) :
     Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on some UNIX
terminals, but horrible on most graphics machines.

Use special colors for torch lite             [view_yellow_lite]     (off) :
     If the option "view_special_light" is also on, floor grids that are only
lit by the player's own light source will appear yellow.  If the option
"view_granite_light" is on, walls will be colored in the same way.  Turning this
option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for field of view          [view_bright_lite]     (off) :
     If the option "view_special_light" is also on, those floor grids that the
player can see directly appear white, and all other known grids appear dark
gray.  If the option "view_granite_light" is on, walls will be colored in the
same way.  Turning this option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for wall grids             [view_granite_lite]    (off) :
     If either the option "view_yellow_light" or "view_bright_light" is on, wall
grids will change color depending on lighting conditions instead of always being
gray.  This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have
been changed, or if graphics are being used.  Turning it off will slightly
increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for floor grids            [view_special_lite]    (off) :
     If either the option "view_yellow_light" or "view_bright_light" is on,
floor grids will change color depending on lighting conditions instead of always
being black or white.  This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for
floors have been changed, or if graphics are being used.  Turning it off will
slightly increase the speed of the game.

Center map continuously (very slow)           [center_player]        (off) :
     Center the map continuously.  Advantages include removal of the need to
adjust the map panel and less jerky character movement; disadvantages include
not being able to control your field of view and constant map shifting.
Substantially slows down the game.

Avoid centering while running                 [run_avoid_center]     (off) :
     Don't center the map when running.  A compromise between normal and always
centered movement.

Show stacks using special attr/char           [show_piles]           (off) :
     Displays a stack of floor objects using a special character.


--- Option Set #6:  Birth ---

     You may only change birth options when starting up a new character.

Adult: Allow purchase of stats using points   [adult_point_based]    (off) :
     Allows you to buy stats using a pool of points.  Gives you extra gold for
each point not spent.  This method allows you to raise individual stats higher
than rolling, but does not give you total stats so great.

Adult: Allow specification of minimal stats   [adult_auto_roller]    (off) :
     Allows you to specify minimum stats when creating a character.  Characters
are randomly generated until one is found to meet your requirements.

     If neither of the two above options is set, you roll for stats manually.

Adult: Maximize effect of race/class bonuses  [adult_maximize]       (on) :
     If maximize mode is ON, racial and class adjustments to vital statistics
(stat) act as permanent modifiers.  A Dwarven priest will be able to raise his
inherent wisdom to 18/150, but his intelligence only to 18/40.
     Maximize mode makes races and classes play more differently, usually to the
player's benefit; it is therefore recommended in most cases.

Adult: Preserve artifacts when leaving level  [adult_preserve]       (on) :
     If preserve mode is ON, artifacts will not be lost unless you actually
identify then abandon them.  However, you get no special feelings (which help
you to find artifacts).  If this option is OFF, artifacts appear once and once
only, but you get special feelings.

Adult: Restrict the use of stairs/recall      [adult_ironman]        (off) :
     Can never go up.  Can never use recall until you win the game.  No stairs
are ever placed under you when you change levels.

Ironman Play:
     "Go down into the dungeon.  Return with Morgoth's Crown or not at all."
In Ironman mode, you can never go up any staircase, and can never return to the
surface by any means, until victorious.  If by accident you do, you must
immediately return to the dungeon.
     Some forms of Ironman play require that you visit no stores before going
into the dungeon, or that you must use a down staircase as soon as you see it
("crash-dive ironman"), but they are variants on the basic theme.

Adult: Restrict the use of stores/home        [adult_no_stores]      (off) :
     Cannot use any stores or your home.

Adult: Restrict creation of artifacts         [adult_no_artifacts]   (off) :
     No artifacts will appear.

Adult: Randomize some of the artifacts (beta) [adult_rand_artifacts] (off) :
     Most of the artifacts will get random names and qualities.  This can make
for a fun change of pace.

Adult: Don't stack objects on the floor       [adult_no_stacking]    (off) :
     The game normally allows many objects to stack in each floor grid.
However, some people prefer the challenge of allowing only one object to appear
in each floor grid.  Turning this option ON causes objects dropped by monsters
to disappear if space is tight, and therefore encourages you to fight battles in
wide-open spaces.


--- Option Set #7:  Cheat ---

Peek into object creation                     [cheat_peek]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

Peek into monster creation                    [cheat_hear]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at monster creation.

Peek into dungeon creation                    [cheat_room]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at room creation.

Know complete monster info                    [cheat_know]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

Allow player to avoid death                   [cheat_live]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.


--- Window Options ---

Window Flags:
     Some platforms support multiple windows, which can display all sorts of
useful information.  The best thing about these windows is that they are
(usually) updated automatically to reflect the current state of the world.

     inven/equip:       Display the player inventory (and equipment).
     equip/inven:       Display the player equipment (and inventory).
     player (basic):    Display the main character screen.
     player (extra):    Display the character screen's equipment flags section.
     messages:          Display recent messages and notes.
     overhead view:     Display an overhead view of the dungeon.
     monster recall:    Display a description of the target monster.
     object recall:     Display a description of the most recently selected
          object.  Currently this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks.
     snap-shot:         This window flag is currently unused.
     script variables:  Used for debugging scripts.
     script source:     Used for debugging scripts.
     borg messages:     Used for the automatic Angband player (the borg).
     borg status:       Used for the automatic Angband player (the borg).

--- Miscellaneous Options ---

Hitpoint warning:
     If non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints (x10) at which you
start to get special warnings.  It is also used as the cut-off for using red to
display both hitpoints and mana.

Delay Factor:
     The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects
used for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks.  The actual time delay is equal
to "delay_factor" squared, in milliseconds.  A value of five works well on many
machines.
     Note:  You also need to have "fresh_before" ON.


--- Options Commands ---

Load a user pref file:
     Reads user preferences (including options) from a file you choose.
Normally used when preferences don't load automatically, and you want to rewrite
them to a file that will.

Append options to a file:
     Saves options to file.  See the preferences section for help on what
filename to use (the file "user.prf" usually works).



====== Inscriptions ======

     You use the '{' and '}' keys to inscribe and uninscribe objects.  The
inscription on an object can have all sorts of effects.

To designate a main and backup weapon:
     Inscribe both with "@w0".  The 'X' command will replace whatever melee
weapon you are wielding with another so inscribed.  You may also inscribe these
or other weapons with "@w1", etc., and wield weapons 0, 1, 2 and so on as
desired.

To have a given command always use the same spellbook:
     Inscribe it with "@m#", or "@p#", replacing the '#' with whatever digit you
desire.  This allows you to set up macros to cast a spell knowing that it will
never choose the wrong book.  Similar inscriptions make archery very convenient,
and allow you to always use a given magical device with the same keystrokes.

     In general, if you inscribe anything with @<<any command>><<any digit>>,
you can issue the command, type the digit, and use the first legal inscribed
object.

To prevent accidental use of an object with any command:
     Inscribe it with "!x", where 'x' is the letter you type to issue that
command.  If you are very paranoid, inscribe it with "!*"

To automatically pick up an object:
     Inscribe it with "=g".  Especially useful for anything you throw.

Inscriptions for fun and profit:
     Try inscribing the first monster killed by a weapon, hidden object
abilities, and where you found the item or who dropped it.

Automatic inscriptions:
     The game also inscribes objects automatically.  Some of these inscriptions
will disappear when the item is identified, and you may overwrite others.

     "broken"         :  Object is broken in some way.
     "cursed"         :  Object is cursed.
     "empty"          :  Object has no more charges (and you know this).
     "indestructible" :  Object cannot be destroyed.
     "tried"          :  Used an object, didn't learn anything about it.
     "50% off"        :  Object is worth 50% less than normal.



====== Macros and keymaps ======

--- Quick Tutorial ---

     Mages are forever casting spell "a", Magic Missile, in spellbook "a", Magic
for Beginners.  In both keysets, that's "maa", plus "*" to enter targeting mode,
and finally "t" to target.  Wouldn't it be nice if you could do all this with a
single keypress?  You can.
     Choose an unused command (we shall pick "'" by way of example).  Bring up
the macro/keymap screen by typing "@".  Press "8" to create a keymap, and the
game will ask you for a trigger.  Type "'".  You then shift to the action field,
where you input all the commands you want "'" to perform when pressed.  In this
case, you would enter:  "maa*t", and press return.
     Now save your new keymap by typing "6", and either allow the game to choose
your character's name for the preference file, or (if you want all of your
characters to use the same keymap) save to "user.prf".

     This is only the beginning.  What you can do with a spell, you can do with
arrows, Rods of Trap Location, resting, activating stuff, talents, searching;
all sorts of command combinations can profitably be macroed.  Macros and keymaps
are even more flexible when used in combination with object inscriptions.
     In all cases, you remember the exact series of keypresses you need to
issue, pick an unused trigger key, and fill in the action field.


--- Basic information ---

Macros:
     Macros allow you to use a single keypress to activate a series of
keypresses.  They fire off in almost all cases:  when the game is waiting for a
command, is showing a menu, is asking you to enter text, etc.  The only time
they don't activate is when you already have a macro active.
     You may use any key as a macro trigger, but it is recommended that you not
use ordinary letters.  You fill out the action field with the same commands you
normally use.

Keymaps  (sometimes known as "command macros"):
     Keymaps only fire off when the game is waiting for a command.  You may not
use special keys (like F1-F12) as keymap triggers, and must use underlying
commands in the action field (a list of such commands is supplied below).

Effects of one on the other:
     Macros are often affected by keymaps; you may bypass keymaps in macros by
putting a "\" before any action key.  Keymaps are never affected by macros.


--- Examples ---

     Macros are so handy that players (Jim Lyon in particular) have compiled
lists of helpful tricks.

To clear any pending messages:
     Insert some "\e"s (escapes) before and/or after your macros.  Be careful
about skipping past important info!  If you want to be a little more careful,
use "\s"s (spaces) instead.

To learn how to represent any key:
     Some keys cannot be entered simply as numbers or letters.  To figure out
how to include the escape key in an action, for example, you bring up the
macro/keymap screen, type 3: Query a macro, and press escape (ESC) when asked
for a trigger.  This will tell you that an escape is represented by "\e".

Rest as needed:
     Keymap a trigger key to "R*\r".  This is also helpful when waiting for a
monster to approach, because you recover mana and HPs twice as quickly than when
staying in place.

Activate the Phial:
     Macro a trigger key to "Af\s\s".


--- In Depth ---

Not all keys can be entered as simple numbers or letters:
     \e     : escape  (useful for clearing the message line)
     \r     : return
     \n     : newline (is normally treated the same as return)
     \s     : space (' ')
     \\     : backslash  ('\')
     \^     : caret ('^')
     ^X     : control-X  (other control keys use the same system)
     \x80   : character in position 0x80
              (in hex:  decimal equivalent would be 128)

Listing of underlying commands:
     Underlying commands are usually the same as those in the original keyset,
but there are important exceptions:

     Underlying command     Original keyset     Roguelike
     5                      ,                   .
     .                      .                   ,
     ;1  (move = ';')       1                   b
     ;2                     2                   j
     ;3                     3                   n
     ;4                     4                   h

====== Preferences ======

     Information about options, usage of extra windows, colors and symbols, and
macros can all be stored in preference files.  In addition, you can customize
the game in many other ways and save these preferences to file.


--- The priority order of preference files ---

     Whenever the game starts up, and whenever it creates or loads a character,
it opens various preference files and modifies various things according to
instructions in them.  The preference files below are listed in descending order
of priority:  anything in higher files overrides anything in a file below it.

"lib/user/<<base name of character>>.prf"
     May contain options, color definitions, attr/char remappings (what
monsters, objects, and features look like), and many other things.  Anything in
this file is guaranteed to override anything in any other file.
     What is the "base name" of your character?  It is the name of your
character, usually with non-alphabetic, non-numeric characters translated to
'_'s, and (on IBM/DOS) shortened to eight characters.  You may check the base
name by trying to save macros or keymaps.

"lib/user/<<character race>>.prf"
     Any preferences that you want to apply to all characters of a given race
should go here.

"lib/user/<<character class>>.prf"
     Any preferences that you want to apply to all characters of a given class
should go here.

"lib/user/user.prf"
     Any preferences that you want to apply to all of your characters should go
here.

"lib/pref/user.prf"
     This file is loaded just before the one above it.  Links to system-specific
user-preference files, which tend to be used by porters to customize the game in
ways that they think users of their system will appreciate.  For example, "user-
mac.prf" includes a bunch of extra macros.


Your character's savefile
     Always contains your current options and window settings.  Never contains
macros, keymaps, or visual preferences (these all need to be saved in an
external file).

     Many players need no other preference files and can stop reading here.


"lib/pref/font.prf":  The basic text-mode preference file.
     Links to font.xxx.prf, which defines the exact colors for all spells and
objects in text mode, and contains the default colors used to display object
descriptions in inventory (wizard books are light red, priest books are light
green, etc.).
     Also links to system-specific text-mode preference files (font-ibm.prf,
font-win.prf, etc.).  Each of these files assigns new text-mode characters and
attributes (colors) for objects, monsters, features, etc.  For example, "font-
ibm.prf" changes dungeon walls from '#'s to solid blocks.

"lib/pref/flvr-xxx.prf":  graphics for individual flavors of objects.
     Links to flvr-new.prf, which handles Adam Bolt's 16x16 graphics, and to
flvr-dvg, which handles David Gervais's 32x32 graphics.

"lib/pref/graf.prf":  The basic graphics-mode preference file.
     Links to font.xxx.prf (but later overrides a lot of the information it
contains).
     Also links to system-specific graphics-mode preference files, all of which
then link to one of two files:
graf-xxx.prf:  The preference file used for 8x8 graphics.
     Each color of objects and spell effects, and each individual terrain and
monster, are assigned their own graphical representation.
graf-new.prf:  The preference file used for Adam Bolt's 16x16 graphics.
graf-dvg.prf:  The preference file used for David Gervais's 32x32 graphics.

"lib/pref/pref.prf":
     This is the source of most default settings except for char/attr
remappings.  It contains the default values of options and the keymaps for the
original and roguelike keysets.  Links to the file "message.prf", which controls
the colors of messages.  Links to system-specific general preference files
(pref-x11.prf, pref-gcu.prf, etc.).  These contain system-specific keymappings
and allow the game to recognize your keyboard.

message.prf:  Message colors.
     Each message can be assigned to a type; each type may have one or more
sounds and a color associated with it.


--- Writing your own preference files ---

     All preference files use a common system to store information.  You must be
careful of two things:
1) Make sure that the file will actually be loaded.  It needs to be one of the
files mentioned above, or be called by one of those files.
2) Watch out for automatic preference dumps.  If you try to edit anything
between the special markers, your changes will be lost.  The solution is to skip
past all the automatic stuff, and put your changes at the bottom, below the last
marker.

List of preference file instructions:

%:human.prf      :  open up the file "lib/pref/human.prf" or
"lib/user/human.prf"
     and read it.  If both files exist, rules in the latter takes priority.

R:0:w/@          :  The monster, with index 0 (zero), will be white ('w'),
     and be represented with a '@'.

R:0:0x8C/0x80    : The monster, with index 0 (zero), will get the graphical
     tile at position (0x8C - 0x80), (0x80 - 0x80) = row 12, column 0.  Note
     that values above 0x7F (127) indicate the use of graphics.

K:50:v/~         :  The object, with index 50, will be violet ('v'), and be
     represented with a '~'.

K:50:0x83/0x96   : The object, with index 50, will get the graphical
     tile at position (0x83 - 0x80), (0x96 - 0x80) = row 3, column 22.

F:1:1/249        :  The feature, with index 1, will be white (color 1), and
     be represented by the character in ASCII position 249 (a centered dot)

S:0xB1:0x01/0x2D : Index B1 (177) of the flavor table will contain the color
     1 (white) and the character in ASCII position 45 ('-').  A detailed
     look at how the flavor table works is beyond the scope of this document;
     suffice it to say that all characters used to display spell effects, and
     all object kinds with flavors, get 16 entries in the flavor table, one
     for each color.

E:90:0x0C        : Tval 90 (magic books) will display in the inventory and
     various listing as color 0x0C (light red).

A:R*\r           : The next key listed will be mapped to this set of
     actions (can be either a keymap or a macro).

C:0:x            : The previous action listed is a keymap, is active in the
     original keyset (set 0), and will be activated by typing 'x'.

P:1:^O           : The previous action listed is a macro, is active in the
     roguelike keyset (set 1), and will be activated by typing control-'O'.

V:1:0x00:0xff:0xff:0xff   :  The color in position 1 (white), will have a
     special value of 0x00 (zero), a red-value of 0xff (255), a green-value
     of 0xff, and a blue-value of 0xff.

X:rogue_like_commands  :  The "rogue_like_commands" option will be off.

Y:rogue_like_commands  :  The "rogue_like_commands" option will be on.

W:2:6:1          : Window 2 (the third one), will display window display #6
     (display messages), and be active (1) as opposed to inactive (0).

M:1:w            : Message type 1 (standard hit message) will appear white.

D:4              : The delay factor will be 4 (squared).

H:3              : The hitpoint warning will be at 30%.

?:<<text>>       : A conditional expression.  If true, allows another
     line to activate.  The tests include:
     AND     - logical AND
     IOR     - inclusive OR
     EQU     - (string) equals
     NOT     - logical negation
     LEQ     - (string) less than or equal to
     GEQ     - (string) greater than or equal to
     [,]     - group expressions
     $CLASS  - current class
     $GRAF   - 3-letter graphics abbr in "graf-***.prf" (old, new)
     $PLAYER - current player name
     $RACE   - current race
     $CLASS  - current class
     $SYS    - 3-letter system abbr in "pref-***.prf" (ami, mac, win,...)
               See the usage in "lib/pref/pref.prf", etc.



====== Visuals, colors, and multimedia ======

Interact with Visuals:  (command: '%') :
     You may adjust the character and attribute (color) used to display objects,
monsters, and terrain features.
     1) Update your preferences with a specific user preference file.
     2) Save your current monster visuals to file.
     3) Save your current object visuals to file.
     4) Save your current terrain visuals to file.
     %) Save your current flavor preferences to file.
     6) Change monster visuals.
     7) Change object visuals.
     8) Change terrain visuals.
     9) Change the symbol and flavor used for many kinds of objects.
     0) Reset visuals to their last saved values (undo all changes).

     When changing visuals, you may type the following keys:
     n: advance one (wrap around if at the end)
     N: go back one (wrap around if at the beginning)
     a: change to the next color (wrap around if at color 15)
     A: change to the previous color (wrap around if at color 0)
     c: change to the next character in the ASCII sequence (wrap around at 255)
     C: change to the previous character (wrap around if at 0)

     A good way to get used to the interface is to choose option 6:  change
monster visuals, note that the first "monster" is your character, and change it
from a white '@' to something silly.  Leave, see how weird you look, come back,
and (if you like) press '0' to reset the visuals.
     Remember to type Control-R after making any changes.



Interact with colors:  (command '&') :
     In the interact with colors display, you have three options available:
     1) Update your preferences with a specific user preference file.
     2) Save your colors to file.
     3) Modify colors.

     When changing colors, you may issue the following commands:
     n: go to the next color (wraps around at 255)
     N: go back one (wrap around if at 0)
     k: change a value (possibly the gamma correction?)
     K: change a value (possibly the gamma correction?)
     r: increase the red in this color (wraps around at hex value 0xff)
     R: decrease the red in this color (wraps around at hex value 0x00)
     g: increase the green in this color (wraps around at hex value 0xff)
     G: decrease the green in this color (wraps around at hex value 0x00)
     b: increase the blue in this color (wraps around at hex value 0xff)
     B: decrease the blue in this color (wraps around at hex value 0x00)

     Note that, while the game is theoretically capable of using more than 16
colors, it is not currently set up to do so.  Also, color 0 should not be
changed.

     Remember to type Control-R after making any changes.


Interact with multimedia:  (command '!') :
     Some ports of this game (but not all) will play sounds and music.  If your
port is one of them, you can adjust volumes, turn sounds off and on entirely,
and tweak various other things.




============================= Combat and Magic =============================


====== Non-magical Combat ======

     Without using magic, you may attack monsters in hand-to-hand (melee)
combat, by using missile weapons, or by throwing things at them.


--- Melee ---

     If you are barehanded, you do a small amount of damage, depending on
strength.  If you are using a weapon, things are a bit different.

Basic Calculation:
     1) roll the weapon's damage dice
     2) apply any slay or brand multiplier
     3) apply any critical hit bonuses
     4) apply bonuses to damage from all equipped items
     5) repeat for all the blows you get

Chance of hitting:
     Your chance of hitting a monster depends on your innate melee skill,
plusses to hit from all equipped items other than your missile weapon, temporary
effects (like blessing or heroism), and on monster armour class.  Unseen
monsters are harder to hit.

Damage Dice:
     All weapons have damage dice displayed after their name (1d4, 2d5, etc.).
The higher the damage dice, the more damage the weapon does, especially if it
has brands or slays, or gets lots of critical hits.

Brands and Slays:
     Some remarkable weapons do extra damage to various kinds of monsters; a
Dagger of Fire, for instance, would do extra damage to creatures not immune to
fire.  Slays, in contrast, do extra damage to particular monster races, so wield
that Mace of Orc Slaying if you come upon any orcs.  Only the best applicable
quality is used; they do not combine.
     See the object attributes section for how powerful individual slays and
brands are.

Critical Hits:
     The number of critical hits you get depends on your total bonuses to melee
skill, your level, and your weapon weight.  Their power depends on weapon
weight.  A weak critical hit might double base damage and add 5; a powerful one
might triple it and add 20.
     For most weapons, critical hits are rare, and make little difference to
average damage.  For heavy wargear with good base damage dice, however, critical
hits can be significant.

Bonus to damage:
     Your melee weapon often has a bonus to damage, expressed as the second
value in parenthesis after the damage dice.  This bonus is applied after all
other adjustments, and is guaranteed.  Raising this value rapidly increases the
amount -- and the reliability -- of the damage you do.

Number of Blows:
     Your character screen also displays the number of blows you can get per
turn.  This value depends on your class, strength and dexterity, and on weapon
weight.  You normally start out with one blow, but will get more as time passes.
     The more blows you get, the more damage you do, and the more reliable melee
becomes (because you get more chances to hit).  If you want to be effective in
hand-to-hand combat, get extra blows if at all possible.


--- Shooting ---

     Ranged fire with missile launchers is a non-magical method of doing damage
at a safe distance.

Basic Calculation:
     1) roll the missile's damage dice
     2) add the damage bonuses from both the missile weapon and the ammunition,
        but not from anything else
     3) apply the missile launcher multiplier
     4) apply any slay or brand multiplier
     5) apply any critical hit bonuses

Setting up to Shoot:
     Slings shoot pebbles, iron shots, and mithril shots, bows shoot arrows,
seeker arrows, and mithril arrows, and crossbows shoot bolts, seeker bolts, and
mithril bolts.  Simply equip the weapon and keep plenty of the ammo on hand and
you're ready.
     You shoot at a monster by typing 'f' (or 't' in the rogue-like command
set), then selecting a missile you would like to fire.  This activates the
targeting interface described in the section on commands.

Chance of hitting:
     Your chance of hitting a monster depends on your innate missile skill,
plusses to hit from all equipped items other than your melee weapon, plusses to
hit on your ammunition, temporary effects (like blessing or heroism), and on
monster armour class.  Unseen monsters are harder to hit.

Base damage:
     Unlike in melee, launcher, slay/brand, and critical hit multiplers are all
applied after the bonus to damage, which is applied directly to the result of
the base damage dice.

Launcher Multiplier:
     All missile launchers have a multiplier to damage:  for example, a Longbow
(x3) would multiply the normal damage of the ammo it fires by three.  Some
special weapons have a higher than normal multiplier.

Brands and Slays:
     Ammunition occasionally possesses the same kinds of slays and brands found
on melee weapons.

Critical hits:
     The number of critical hits you get depends on your total bonuses to
missile skill, your level, and your missile weight, but they are always rare.
Their power depends on missile weight.  Almost all critical hits multiply damage
by 2 and add 5.

Number of Shots:
     On your character screen is displayed the number of shots you can get per
turn.  You always get one shot unless you are using a weapon of extra shots.
Rangers are the exception to this rule; they eventually get two extra shots per
turn with bows.  Extra shots are not fired all at once; instead, each shot takes
less time, making monsters appear to move in slow motion.


--- Throwing ---

     Melee weapons also do (some) damage when thrown, and there are potions and
mushrooms that can be deadly.

Basic Calculation:
     1) Roll the object's base damage dice.
     2) Add any bonus to damage (only wargear will have such a bonus).
     3) Apply any slay or brand multiplier.
     4) Apply any critical hit.

Chance of hitting:
     Your chance of hitting a monster depends on your innate missile skill,
plusses to hit from all equipped items other than your melee and missile
weapons, temporary effects (like blessing or heroism), and on monster armour
class.  Unseen monsters are harder to hit.

Comments:
     You may only throw one object per turn.  Your throwing range depends on
object weight and your strength.


--- Winning "unwinnable" fights ---

     Some monsters are simply too tough to just clobber; fortunately, there are
scrolls, potions, spells, and magical devices that can turn a losing battle into
a major victory.  If your enemies seem too tough to kill now, maybe they won't
be after you've enhanced yourself and hindered them.


--- Details ---

Special Notes:
     In order to attack a creature that you can't see in a wall or door, you
must issue the Tunnel or alter adjacent grid command.



====== Defence ======

Healing:
     If your hitpoints drop below zero, you die.  Always have something to
quickly restore them.

Escaping:
     A trapped adventurer is a dead adventurer.  Always have a way to get out of
trouble.

Detecting:
     The best defence is being prepared.  Don't get ambushed.

Defending against pure damage:
     Your armour class (AC) reduces the chance that melee attacks will hit you.
It reduces the pure damage inflicted by ordinary melee attacks (those without
any special effects), and protects against certain kinds of traps, but offers no
defence against magic or ranged attacks.
      Each piece of armour has a base AC value and possibly also a magical
bonus.  Add the two together, and you have the total protective value of the
item.  For example, a Chain Mail (-3) [14, +6] increases your AC by 20.  Note
the "(-3)".  It is a (small) penalty to fighting; heavy armour restricts your
movement slightly.

Cuts, poison, and stunning:
     Many monsters can inflict special kinds of physical damage on you, such as
opening wounds, poisoning, or stunning.  After you start earning a little money,
plow some of it back into potions of cure wounds, and keep them handy at all
times.  If a monster manages to heavily stun you, get away fast!

Character-hindrance:
     There are many monsters capable of casting spells to blind, confuse, slow,
and paralyze you, plus quite a few other nasty tricks not mentioned here.  Free
Action (paralyzation immunity) eventually becomes critical to your survival, and
you should keep stuff that fixes blindness and confusion on hand.  Your Saving
Throw protects against these and other attacks.

Elemental and magical attacks:
     Acid, Electricity, Fire, and Cold are the basic elements, and many monsters
use them.  Because the maximum damage they can do to you is very high, becoming
resistant is important.  Unlike with other attack types, you can resist, double
resist, and be immune to the elements.  Double resistance is the combination of
a permanent resistance (from equipment) and a temporary one (from a spell).
Temporary resistances are also known as oppositions.  Immunity to any of the
elements is hard to get.
     Poison is deadly, and not so easy to gain resistance to.  You can double-
resist (resist and oppose) poison.
     There are many kinds of magical attacks; most can be resisted, some can
not.  The resistable ones capable of doing the most damage are darkness, chaos,
and nether.

     For more detail, see the section on object attributes.

Reductions of Experience and Stats:
     Even when your character is starting out, there are rare traps and monsters
capable of lowering his stats and draining his experience.  Slowly, these
dangers increase until it becomes very important that you find objects that
provide hold life and sustain at least your critical stats.

Theft:
     Nobody is more annoying than a thief.  You've just found that cool
spellbook or nifty weapon, and now it's gone.  You can gain a significant degree
of protection from theft by increasing your armour class and your dexterity, and
can always collect your stuff from the thief's corpse.  Unfortunately, thieves
are smart enough to stash away the money they take from you.



====== Magic ======


--- Spellcasting ---

     Spells and prayers are collected in books, nine for each realm.  Four are
readily available in stores, the other five are harder to find.

Getting spell information:
      You may browse books of your realm.  Spells that you have cast
successfully will display any power or damage information.  Be aware that the
true usefulness of some spells only becomes apparent with much experimentation.

Gaining new spells:
     You learn new spells by pressing 'G', choosing a spellbook with unlearnt
spells that are not too high level for you, and either choosing a spell (mages,
rogues, rangers) or having one granted to you (priests, paladins).

Casting spells:
     You may cast any previously learnt spell of your level or less.  You cast
spells by typing 'm' or 'p', choosing a spellbook, and then a spell.  Casting a
spell takes a full turn.  The first time you suceesfully cast a spell, you gain
experience.
     If you don't have enough mana to cast that spell, you are more likely to
fail; if you do succeed, you will faint from the exertion and sometimes lose a
point of constitution.

Mana:
     Your mana depends on your level and your spell stat.  All spellcasters lose
a point of mana for each pound of worn armour above a certain weight; mages are
most affected.  In addition, mages, rogues, and rangers lose a chunk of mana if
they wear gloves that do not provide free action or improve dexterity.  Messages
will warn you whenever this happens.

Spell failure chance:
     Your spell failure chance depends on the spell itself (some spells are
inherently hard to cast), the minimum level required to cast the spell compared
to your current level, and your spell stat.  When stunned, all spells are harder
to cast.  Only mages and priests can ever have spell failure rates below 5%.
     Priests suffer a substantial increase to prayer failure chance if they
wield an unblessed edged weapon (a sword or polearm).


--- Magical Devices ---

     Wands, staffs, and rods are an important part of many adventurers'
arsenals.  In addition to these items, certain rare rings can be 'A'ctivated and
there are rumours of armours and artifacts that can unleash enormous
destruction.

Recharging:
     Wands and staffs have to be recharged every so often, and you can also
recharge rods.  The failure rate of recharging depends on item level, number of
existing charges, and the power of the recharging spell you are using.
Recharging wands and staffs is very risky.


--- Hindering your foes ---

     If it looks too tough to kill, perhaps you can knock it down a bit.  Many
low-level, non-unique monsters can be hindered in some way if you work hard
enough at it.

     - Sleep : Sleeping monsters can't hurt you - until they wake up again.
     - Slow : If you can slow a monster, you are well on the way to killing it.
     - Stun : Sound blasts and ice can stun monsters, effectively paralyzing
       them.
     - Confuse : Monsters may be confused by bright light (blinding), confusion
       attacks, or spells of confuse monster.  They move randomly about and
       cannot cast any spells until the effects wear off.
     - Fear : Most monsters can be frightened.  Those that are will attempt to
       teleport away (if they have such a spell) or run.


--- Spell projection types ---

     The names of spells and magical devices sometimes give you information
about what areas they affect, and what shapes they take.

"Bolt", "Missile"
     Fires a magical bolt in a direction or at your chosen target.  Bolts are
stopped by the first monster or wall in their way.  Some also "Beam" upon
occasion.

"Beam", "Spear", "Lance", "Line", "Spark", "Cone"
     Fires a beam of magic in the direction you choose, or towards your target.
They are quite useful because they do full damage to every monster in a straight
line.  Wands and Rods of Light work this way.

"Ball", "Orb", "Storm"  (storms have a larger radius)
     If you target a specific monster, such spells explode centered at that
location.  Otherwise, they travel in the direction you choose, and explode as
soon they hit a monster or wall, or reach their maximum range.  These spells
only do full damage to the single grid at the center of the explosion, but can
affect monsters that can't see you.

"Dispel", "Confuse/Slow/Frighten/etc. Monsters"
     A fair number of spells affect all monsters in line of sight (no walls or
rubble between you and them, up to a range of 20).




================ Saving, Loading, Winning, Cheating, and Dying ================


     Saving and loading your character should be easy.  So, sadly, is getting
him killed.  Winning is a little harder, but the novice player can take
advantage of various cheats to improve his chances down in the dungeon.


--- Saving your Game ---

     Saving your game is usually easy.  You can use the save game command, or
(on some systems) a menu option.  If you cannot save your game, you probably
have one of two problems:
1) The folder "<<game>>/lib/save" does not exist.  Create this directory and
   any others that are missing.
2) You are using a multi-user machine and do not have write permission to
   that file or directory.


--- Loading your Game ---

DOS, UNIX:
     The game will automatically look for savefiles in the "lib/save" directory.
1) It will try to load any file that you specify with the "-u" command line
   option.
2) It will try to load any file named "PLAYER" (capitalization may or may not be
   ignored).

Macintosh, Windows:
     You choose the menu option "file -> open", which allows you to load
savefiles from almost any directory.  With suitable use of option files, the
Macintosh can also save to almost any directory.

Loading dead characters:
     If you load a dead character, the game will start up with the character
birth interface.  The new character inherits the monster knowledge of his
ancestor.

Savefile compatibility report:
     Angband loads files from Angband 2.9.0 and later.  To use earlier
savefiles, import it into Angband 2.9.3, resave, and then open it up with the
current version.


--- Winning The Game ---

     Once you have killed Sauron, who lives on level 99 (4950') in the dungeon,
a magical staircase will appear that will allow you to finally reach level 100.
Morgoth lurks on this level of the dungeon, and you will not be able to go below
his level until you have killed him.  Try to avoid wandering around on level 100
unless you are ready for him, since he has a habit of coming at you across the
dungeon, the Mighty Hammer 'Grond' in hand, to slay you for your impudence.

     Morgoth cannot be killed by some of the easier methods used on normal
creatures.  Morgoth, like all other unique monsters, will simply teleport away
to another region of the level if you attempt to use a spell such as destruction
upon him.  He also cannot be polymorphed, slept, charmed, or genocided.  Magical
spells like Mana Storm and Annihilation are effective against him, as are some
of the more powerful weapons, but he is difficult to kill and if allowed to
escape for a time will heal himself rapidly.

     If you should actually survive the attempt of killing Morgoth, you will
receive the status of WINNER.  You may continue to explore, and may even save
the game and play more later, but since you have defeated the toughest creature
alive, there is really not much point.  Unless you wish to listen to the rumours
of a powerful ring buried somewhere in the dungeon...

     When you are ready to retire, simply "commit suicide" (using the "Q" key)
to have your character entered into the high score list as a winner.  Note that
until you retire, you can still be killed, so you may want to retire before
wandering into a room with 95 Death Molds crammed inside...


--- Upon Death and Dying ---

     If your character's hit points fall below zero, he dies.  The dreaded
tombstone will appear, and you may check out his attributes and possessions one
last time.

     Your character will leave behind a reduced save file, which contains only
the monster memory and your option choices, both of which new characters may
use.  It is very helpful to know something about the monster that slew your
ancestor!


--- Cheating Death ---

     One of the most important things about this game is that your character's
life is so important.  Let him die, and you start over from scratch.  This is
one of the secrets to this game's fascination; anyone who cheats death is really
not getting the full experience, and any Morgoth-slayers yanked from the jaws of
death are not full winners.  But what if your characters seem to die all the
time (like mine!), and you really want to keep playing with the same guy?  Well,
the game has a few answers for that too.  You may cheat death by:

     - Toggling on the "cheat death" option.  This keeps your character ticking,
       and is even kind enough to give you a running tally of your deaths by
       setting the character's age to zero when first used, and increasing it by
       one each time thereafter.  Trying to keep this number low is a great way
       to learn the game.
     - Making backup savefiles.
     - Aborting the game just as the tombstone appears or before.




================================= Appendices ==================================


====== Object Attributes ======


     All effective combat methods require equipment, and all benefit greatly
from various qualities that your equipped items may possess.  Defence is
similarly equipment-dependent.


--- Ordinary Attributes ---

Example 1:  A Battle Axe (2d8) (+6,+4)

Damage dice:
     The weapon above rolls two eight-sided dice in battle, for an average base
damage of: 2 * (8 + 1) / 2  =>  2 * 9 / 2  =>  9.

Bonus to hit:
     The weapon above has a bonus to hit of 6.  This bonus improves your chance
to hit monsters.  Apart from rare gloves, armours seldom have bonuses to combat.
Some have small penalties (see below).

Bonus to damage:
     The weapon above gets a bonus to damage of 4, and so does 2d8 + 4 points of
damage on most hits.  Apart from rare gloves, armours seldom have bonuses to
Deadliness.


Example 2:  A Hard Leather Armour (-1) [6,+5]

Base Armour Class (AC):
     This armour has a base AC of 6.  All armours have a base armour class; very
few weapons do.

Bonus to Armour Class:
     This armour has a bonus to AC of 5, which gives it a total protective value
of 11.  Armour of unusually good quality or that is magical also increases your
bonus to armour class.  Only rare weapons do the same.


Example 3:  A Mace (Holy Avenger) (2d4) (+7,+5) [+3] (+1)

     This weapon is a Holy Avenger (one of the more powerful ego-items).  It
rolls 2 four-sided dice when attacking and has +7 to hit and +5 to damage.  It
increases your AC by 3, and increases a numerical attribute (Wisdom, in this
case) by 1.


--- Adjustments to Vital statistics and Abilities ---

Stat Bonuses:
     Any kind of wearable item may affect one or more stats.  See the section on
your character to find out more about what altering a stat does.

Sustain Stats:
     Any kind of wearable item may sustain one or more stats.  This ensures that
the attacks of your foes never lower that stat.

Stealth:
     Certain cloaks, boots, and (more rarely) other items lessen the amount of
noise you make when moving around the dungeon.  This is very handy for avoiding
fights and getting in the first hit.

Searching:
     Some rings, headgear, and various other items improve your chances to
reveal secret doors and find traps before they find you.  Bonuses to searching
improve both automatic and manual searching.

Infravision:
     Some headgear and (more rarely) other items increase the range at which you
can see warm-blooded creatures, even those that would otherwise be invisible.

Tunneling:
     Some gloves and weapons allow you to dig through rock more effectively.
All special digging tools have a bonus to tunneling.

Speed:
     Boots, rings, and weapons that hasten you are rare and powerful, for a fast
player can perform several actions in the time it used to take to do just one.
Players moving at speed -10 are half as fast as normal, at +10 are twice as fast
as normal, and at +20 are three times as fast as normal.  The maximum useful
speed is (roughly) +30.


--- Weapon Attributes ---

Damage multipliers  (only the best applies):
     Slay Evil      :  x2 against evil
     Slay Animal    :  x2 against animals
     Slay Orc       :  x3 against orcs and orc-like creatures
     Slay Troll     :  x3 against trolls
     Slay Giant     :  x3 against giants
     Slay Undead    :  x3 against undead
     Slay Demon     :  x3 against demons
     Slay Dragon    :  x3 against dragons

     Execute Undead :  x5 against undead
     Execute Demon  :  x5 against demons
     Execute Dragon :  x5 against dragons

     Brand Acid     :  x3 against everything not resistant to acid
     Brand Elec     :  x3 against everything not resistant to electricity
     Brand Fire     :  x3 against everything not resistant to fire
     Brand Cold     :  x3 against everything not resistant to cold
     Brand Pois     :  x3 against everything not resistant to poison



Blows:
     Gives you extra melee blows.

Extra Shots:
     Rare missile launchers may allow the player to shoot more quickly than
normal.  Each shot takes a fraction of a turn, making your target appear to move
in slow motion.

Extra Might:
     Rare missile launchers have a greater than normal missile damage
multiplier.  For example, a "Sling of Extra Might (x2) (+1)" multiplies damage,
not by two like lesser slings, but by three.  The true missile weapon multiplier
is never known for sure until the object is identified.

Blessed:
     Blessed weapons may be used by pious characters without penalty.

Earthquake:
     Some weapons cause earthquakes when they hit.


--- Immunities ---

     If you should ever be fortunate enough to find a piece of equipment that
grants immunity to an element, you will take no damage from that element.
Immunity also means that everything you are wearing or carrying is perfectly
protected.

Immunity to Acid:
     You take no damage from acid, and acid cannot attack your backpack.

Immunity to Electricity:
     You take no damage from electricity, and electricity cannot attack your
backpack.

Immunity to Cold:
     You take no damage from cold, and cold cannot attack your backpack.

Immunity to Fire:
     You take no damage from fire, and fire cannot attack your backpack.


--- Resistances ---

     Resistances from equipment cannot be combined; you either have it or you
don't.  You can, however, temporarily oppose the elements and poison for an
additional 2/3rds reduction in damage.
     Resistances and oppositions have no effect on the amount of damage
elemental attacks do to items in your backpack.

Resist Acid:
     You take one-thirds damage from acid.

Resist Electricity:
     You take one-thirds damage from electricity.

Resist Cold:
     You take one thirds damage from cold.

Resist Fire:
     You take one-thirds damage from fire.

Resist Poison:
     You take one thirds damage from poison.

Resist Light:
     The damage you take from light is reduced.  You cannot be blinded by bright
light.

Resist Darkness:
     The damage you take from darkness is reduced.  You cannot be blinded by
darkness.

Resist Sound:
     The damage you take from sound is reduced.  You cannot be stunned by sound
or by a few other kinds of distance attacks.

Resist Shards:
     The damage you take from blasts of shards is reduced.  You cannot be cut by
shards.

Resist Nexus:
     The damage you take from nexus attacks is reduced.  You cannot be randomly
teleported or altered by nexus.

Resist Nether:
     The damage you take from nether is reduced.  You cannot lose experience to
nether.

Resist Chaos:
     The damage you take from chaos is reduced, and you are immune to all the
nasty things chaos can do to you.  This resistance does not make you resistant
to confusion.

Resist Disenchantment:
     Rarest of all the resistances, this reduces damage from disenchantment
attacks and renders your equipment immune to disenchantment.

Ignore acid, electricity, fire, and cold:
     Some objects cannot be damaged or destroyed by elemental attacks.


--- Survival Attributes ---

Resist Fear:
     Renders you fearless.

Resist Blindness:
     Protects you from being blinded.

Resist Confusion:
     Makes you incapable of being confused.  Also reduces damage from blasts of
confusion.


--- Character Qualities ---

Slow Digestion:
     Reduces your need to consume food.

Feather Fall:
     Renders pit traps and trap doors harmless.

Light:
     Some weapons and helms shine with inner light.  Each such object increases
your illumination radius by one.

Regeneration:
     Players who regenerate recover hitpoints and mana twice as quickly as
normal.  They also need to eat more.

Telepathy (ESP):
     It is not easy to acquire this, but players who do can see intelligent
monsters nearby.  Mindless monsters never appear, and semi-intelligent monsters
only appear occasionally.

See Invisible:
     Allows you to see and target monsters invisible to ordinary sight.

Free Action:
     Protects you from paralyzation and most slowing attacks.  Because
paralyzation can instantly kill you, keep an eye out for this important survival
aid.

Hold Life:
     Offers a high degree of protection from attacks (but not items) that reduce
experience.


--- Curses and other Nastiness ---

Random Teleportation:
     Some foul rings, amulets, and boots randomly take control of your movement
and whisk you around the dungeon.

Aggravate:
     Aggravation effectively reduces your stealth to nil, immediately waking up
all monsters nearby.  Some rings and amulets possess curses that aggravate, and
some weapons and armours are so powerful that no creature can ignore them.

Drain Exp:
     Objects that drain experience are perilous, because they slowly but surely
erase your accumulated memories.  Of course, you can keep killing monsters to
replace the experience which you lose.

Light (Normal) Curse:
     Many objects have light curses.  If you should wear or wield one, read a
scroll of remove curse.

Heavy Curse:
     The curses on some objects are less easy to remove.  If a ordinary scroll
of Remove Cure fails, find and read one of *Remove Curse*.

Permanent Curse:
     There is a great and terrible Ring, seen by perhaps one character in ten
thousand, that can never be removed once put on.

====== Description, History, and Copyrights ======


=== Version Information ===

This file was last updated for Angband 3.0.1.

Make sure to read the newsgroup ("rec.games.roguelike.angband"), and to visit
the Official Angband Home Page ("http://www.thangorodrim.net") for the most
up to date information about Angband.

Angband 3.0.1 has an incredibly complex history, and is the result of a
lot of work by a lot of people, all of whom have contributed their time
and energy for free, being rewarded only by the pleasure of keeping alive
one of the best freeware games available anywhere.

The version control files, if they existed, would span more than ten years
time, and more than six different primary developers.  Without such files,
we must rely on simpler methods, such as change logs, source file diffs, and
word of mouth.  Some of this information is summarized in this file.

Please be sure to read the copyright information at the end of this file.

=== Brief Version History ===

First came "VMS Moria", by Robert Alan Koeneke (1985).

Then came "Umoria" (Unix Moria), by James E. Wilson (1989).

Details about the history of the various flavors of "Moria", the direct
ancestor to Angband, can be found elsewhere, and a note from Robert Alan
Koeneke is included in this file.  Note that "Moria" has been ported to
a variety of platforms, and has its own newsgroup, and its own fans.

In 1990, Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand, with the help of other students
at the University of Warwick, created Angband 1.0, based on the existing
code for Umoria 5.2.1.  They wanted to expand the game, keeping or even
strengthening the grounding in Tolkien lore, while adding more monsters
and items, including unique monsters and artifact items, plus activation,
pseudo-sensing, level feelings, and special dungeon rooms.

Over time, Sean Marsh, Geoff Hill, Charles Teague, and others, worked on
the source, releasing a copy known as "Angband 2.4.frog_knows" at some
point, which ran only on Unix systems, but which was ported by various
people to various other systems.  One of the most significant ports was
the "PC Angband 1.4" port, for old DOS machines, which added color and
various other significant changes, only some of which ever made it back
into the official source.

Then Charles Swiger (cs4w+@andrew.cmu.edu) took over, sometime in late
1993, cleaning up the code, fixing a lot of bugs, and bringing together
various patches from various people, resulting in several versions of
Angband, starting with Angband 2.5.1 (?), and leading up to the release
of Angband 2.6.1 (and Angband 2.6.2) in late 1994.  Some of the changes
during this period were based on suggestions from the "net", and from
various related games, including "UMoria 5.5", "PC Angband 1.4", and
"FAngband".

Angband 2.6.1 was primarily targetted towards Unix/NeXT machines, and
it required the use of the low level "curses" commands for all screen
manipulation and keypress interaction.  Each release had to be ported
from scratch to any new platforms, normally by creating visual display
code that acted as a "curses" emulator.  One such port was "Macintosh
Angband 2.6.1", by Keith Randall, which added support for color, and
which formed the basis for the first release of Angband 2.7.0.

During the last half of 1994, Ben Harrison had been playing with
the Angband source, primarily to investigate the possibility of making
some kind of automatic player for Angband, like the old "rogue-o-matic"
program for the game "Rogue".  The difficulty of compiling a version
for the Macintosh, and the complexity of the code, prevented this, and
so Ben began cleaning up the code in various ways for his personal use.

In late 1994, Charles Swiger announced that he was starting a real job
and would no longer be able to be the Angband maintainer.  This induced
some amount of uproar in the Angband community (as represented by the
Angband newsgroup), with various people attempting to form "committees"
to take over the maintenance of Angband.  Since committees have never
given us anything but trouble (think "COBOL"), there was very little
resistance when, on the first day of 1995, Ben made his code available,
calling it "Angband 2.7.0", and by default, taking over as the new
maintainer of Angband.

Angband 2.7.0 was a very clean (but very buggy) rewrite that, among other
things, allowed extremely simple porting to multiple platforms, starting
with Unix and Macintosh, and by the time most of the bugs were cleaned up,
in Angband 2.7.2, including X11, and various IBM machines.  Angband 2.7.4
was released to the "ftp.cis.ksu.edu" site, and quickly gained acceptance,
perhaps helped by the OS2 and Windows and Amiga and Linux ports.  Angband
2.7.5 and 2.7.6 added important capabilities such as macros and user pref
files, and continued to clean up the source.  Angband 2.7.8 was released
to the major ftp archives as the first "stable" version in a year or so,
with new "help files" and "spoiler files" for the "online help", plus a
variety of minor tweaks and some new features.

After Angband 2.7.8 was released, Ben created a web site to keep track of
all the changes made in each version (though a few may have been missed),
and acquired the use of a new develoepement ftp server to supplement the
official "mirror" server.  This web site is now permanently located at
the Official Angband Home Page (http://www.thangorodrim.net/).
Unfortunately, the next six versions were numbered Angband 2.7.9v1 to
Angband 2.7.9v6, but really each were rather major updates.  Angband 2.8.0
and 2.8.1 were released using a more normal version scheme.  Angband 2.8.2
and 2.8.3 add a few random features, clean up some code, and provide
graphics support and such for a few more platforms.

After the release of Angband 2.8.3 Ben's free time was more and more
occupied by his work.  He released a beta version of Angband 2.8.5,
introducing many new features, but couldn't give as much attention to
maintaining the game as he wanted to.  Meanwhile, an "unofficial" version
by Robert Ruehlmann, incorporating three popular patches (the "Easy Patch"
by Tim Baker, for opening doors and disarming traps without specifying
the direction: Greg Wooledge's "Random Artifacts" patch: and Keldon Jones's
"Optional Monster AI Improvement"), named "2.8.3h", was gaining popularity.

So in March 2000, Robert Ruehlmann offered to take over Angband and
started to fix the remaining bugs in the Angband 2.8.5 beta.  The
resulting version was to be released as Angband 2.9.0. Further
bugfixes and a couple of new features - including many in the realms
of user-customizability, with greater control over ego-items, player
races and classes, monsters, items and artifacts - have led to the
current version.

And with the greater amount of user-customizability that is now possible,
it was inevitable that SOMEBODY would eventually go and actually do
something with it.  Jonathan Ellis started customizing the user-editable
text files in the "edit" directory for his own personal use - originally,
only by fixing bugs and inconsistencies (less powerful monsters being worth
more experience per kill than more powerful ones, dragons doing a decent
amount of damage in melee, monsters with two claws and one mouth getting
one claw and three bite attacks, and so on).

At first, this was all that could really be done with it: adding new
monsters and items was impossible, as the limits were fixed. And so only
three new monsters made an appearance, each of them replacing an existing
monster in the order: and one new artifact - "The Palantir of Westernesse".
Gameplay balance could be tweaked somewhat, by changing the level, power and
rarity of certain items and monsters: and some changes were made, mostly
with the attempt to reduce the notorious "triple whammy" effect of needing
poison, confusion and nether resistance (or over 550 hps, if without nether
resistance) all at once, straight after passing 2000', forcing excessive
scumming before this depth or risking unavoidable instant death: and then
having nothing left to do but dive straight to 4000' and scum for speed
items, missing out on some of the most interesting depths of the dungeon.
This problem, at least, could be addressed, but actual new things were less
easy to add...

That all changed with Angband 2.9.1, which for the first time moved the
limits themselves to a separate user-editable file, and allowed more
monsters and items to be created without removing the old ones. At the
same time, a patch by Matthias Kurzke was incorporated which allowed the
creation of new ego-items.  Various new powers, for the player and
monsters, were added to the game - but no items or monsters yet had these
powers (resist fear, poison brand, lose charisma, summon greater demons,
and so on): indeed, arguably it could be said that the game had not even
adjusted properly to Ben Harrison's fractional speed system (Angband 2.7.0)
or the addition of the other attack forms such as shards, sound, chaos,
nexus and so on (even before Ben.)


The Official Angband Home Page ("http://www.thangorodrim.net/") serves
not only as the most up to date description of Angband, but also lists
changes made between versions, and changes planned for upcoming versions,
and lists various email addresses and web sites related to Angband.

=== Some of the changes between Angband 2.6.1 and now ===

It is very hard to pin down, along the way from 2.6.2 to the current
version, exactly what changes were made, and exactly when they were made.
Most releases involved so many changes from the previous release as to make
"diff files" not very useful, since often the diff files are as long as the
code itself. Most of the changes, with the notable exception of the creation
of some of the new "main-xxx.c" files for the various new platforms, and a
few other minor exceptions generally noted directly in comments in the
source, were written by Ben or Robert, either spontaneously, or, more
commonly, as the result of a suggestion or comment by an Angband player.

The most important modification was a massive "code level cleanup" for 2.7.x,
largely completed in 2.7.8, that made all other modifications much simpler
and safer.  This cleanup was so massive that in many places the code is no
longer recognizable, for example, via "diff -r", often because it was
rewritten from scratch.

The second most important modification was the design of a generic "z-term.c"
package, which allows Angband to be ported to a new machine with as few as 50
lines of code.  Angband 2.9.3 thus runs without modification on many machines,
including Macintosh, PowerMac, Unix/X11, Unix/Curses, Amiga, Windows, OS2-386,
DOS-386, and even DOS-286.

It would be difficult to list all of the changes between Angband 2.6.1 and
the current version, because many of them were made in passing during the
massive code level cleanup.  Many of the changes are invisible to the user,
but still provide increased simplicity and efficiency, and decreased code
size, or make other more visable changes possible.  For example, the new
"project()" code that handles all bolts, beams, and balls, the new
"update_view()" code that simplifies line of sight computation, or the new
"generate()" code that builds new levels in the dungeon.  Many changes have
been made to increase efficiency, including the new "process_monsters()"
and "update_monsters()" functions, and the new "objdes()" and "lite_spot()"
routines.  The generic "z-term.c" package yielded efficient screen updates,
and enabled the efficient use of "color".

The most visible (to ordinary players) changes that happened as a result of
Ben Harrison's maintainership were (a) a far greater degree of user-
customizability as shown by the info.txt files, (b) the "fractional" speed
system, with +10 in the new scheme equalling +1 in old money, and
(c) object stacking, the ability to have more than one object in a square:
first tried in 2.7.9, completed in 2.8.2.

It should also be pointed out at this point that the far cleaner nature of
Ben's code as compared to previous versions has given many other people the
opportunity to base code for their own Angband variants on it. And so a
plethora of new variants have appeared, many of them far more different from
Angband now than Angband ever was from Moria, and yet still based on Ben's
coding ideals for Angband.

For Angband 2.9.0, the first few new visible features were a random artifact
generator (originally developed from a variant by Greg Wooledge), an option to
improve monster AI (believed to have originally started out life in a patch
written by Keldon Jones), and a patch to allow easier handling of opening and
closing doors and disarming traps (by Tim Baker). For Angband 2.9.1 has also
come such things as the ability to increase the size of the editable textfiles
and thus the number of monsters, artifacts, items, ego-items and vaults in
the game (many new vaults were written by Chris Weisiger, some by others, and
the number of vaults in the game at this time was doubled), and much greater
customizability of ego-items has become possible thanks to a patch written by
Matthias Kurzke. It is also now possible to add new character races to the
game, and to edit the shopkeepers with respect to their greed, tolerance of
haggling and reactions to the character based on his race. Angband 2.9.2 adds
support for poison branded weapons to the game.  Angband 2.9.3 made the
character class itself customizable to an extent.


=== A Posting from the Original Author ===

From: koeneke@ionet.net (Robert Alan Koeneke)
Newsgroups: rec.games.roguelike.angband,rec.games.roguelike.moria
Subject: Early history of Moria
Date: Wed, 21 Feb 1996 04:20:51 GMT

I had some email show up asking about the origin of Moria, and its
relation to Rogue.  So I thought I would just post some text on the
early days of Moria.

First of all, yes, I really am the Robert Koeneke who wrote the first
Moria.  I had a lot of mail accussing me of pulling their leg and
such.  I just recently connected to Internet (yes, I work for a
company in the dark ages where Internet is concerned) and
was real surprised to find Moria in the news groups...  Angband was an
even bigger surprise, since I have never seen it.  I probably spoke to
its originator though...  I have given permission to lots of people
through the years to enhance, modify, or whatever as long as they
freely distributed the results.  I have always been a proponent of
sharing games, not selling them.

Anyway...

Around 1980 or 81 I was enrolled in engineering courses at the
University of Oklahoma.  The engineering lab ran on a PDP 1170 under
an early version of UNIX.  I was always good at computers, so it was
natural for me to get to know the system administrators.  They invited
me one night to stay and play some games, an early startrek game, The
Colossal Cave Adventure (later just 'Adventure'), and late one night,
a new dungeon game called 'Rogue'.

So yes, I was exposed to Rogue before Moria was even a gleam in my
eye.  In fact, Rogue was directly responsible for millions of hours of
play time wasted on Moria and its descendents...

Soon after playing Rogue (and man, was I HOOKED), I got a job in a
different department as a student assistant in computers.  I worked on
one of the early VAX 11/780's running VMS, and no games were available
for it at that time.  The engineering lab got a real geek of an
administrator who thought the only purpose of a computer was WORK!
Imagine...  Soooo, no more games, and no more rogue!

This was intolerable!  So I decided to write my own rogue game, Moria
Beta 1.0.  I had three languages available on my VMS system.  Fortran
IV, PASCAL V1.?, and BASIC.  Since most of the game was string
manipulation, I wrote the first attempt at Moria in VMS BASIC, and it
looked a LOT like Rogue, at least what I could remember of it.  Then I
began getting ideas of how to improve it, how it should work
differently, and I pretty much didn't touch it for about a year.

Around 1983, two things happened that caused Moria to be born in its
recognizable form.  I was engaged to be married, and the only cure for
THAT is to work so hard you can't think about it; and I was enrolled
for fall to take an operating systems class in PASCAL.

So, I investigated the new version of VMS PASCAL and found out it had
a new feature.  Variable length strings!  Wow...

That summer I finished Moria 1.0 in VMS PASCAL.  I learned more about
data structures, optimization, and just plain programming that summer
then in all of my years in school.  I soon drew a crowd of devoted
Moria players...  All at OU.

I asked Jimmey Todd, a good friend of mine, to write a better
character generator for the game, and so the skills and history were
born.  Jimmey helped out on many of the functions in the game as well.
This would have been about Moria 2.0

In the following two years, I listened a lot to my players and kept
making enhancements to the game to fix problems, to challenge them,
and to keep them going.  If anyone managed to win, I immediately found
out how, and 'enhanced' the game to make it harder.  I once vowed it
was 'unbeatable', and a week later a friend of mine beat it!  His
character, 'Iggy', was placed into the game as 'The Evil Iggy', and
immortalized...  And of course, I went in and plugged up the trick he
used to win...

Around 1985 I started sending out source to other universities.  Just
before a OU / Texas football clash, I was asked to send a copy to the
Univeristy of Texas...  I couldn't resist...  I modified it so that
the begger on the town level was 'An OU football fan' and they moved
at maximum rate.  They also multiplied at maximum rate...  So the
first step you took and woke one up, it crossed the floor increasing
to hundreds of them and pounded you into oblivion...  I soon received
a call and provided instructions on how to 'de-enhance' the game!

Around 1986 - 87 I released Moria 4.7, my last official release.  I
was working on a Moria 5.0 when I left OU to go to work for American
Airlines (and yes, I still work there).  Moria 5.0 was a complete
rewrite, and contained many neat enhancements, features, you name it.
It had water, streams, lakes, pools, with water monsters.  It had
'mysterious orbs' which could be carried like torches for light but
also gave off magical aura's (like protection from fire, or aggrivate
monster...).  It had new weapons and treasures...  I left it with the
student assistants at OU to be finished, but I guess it soon died on
the vine.  As far as I know, that source was lost...

I gave permission to anyone who asked to work on the game.  Several
people asked if they could convert it to 'C', and I said fine as long
as a complete credit history was maintained, and that it could NEVER
be sold, only given.  So I guess one or more of them succeeded in
their efforts to rewrite it in 'C'.

I have since received thousands of letters from all over the world
from players telling about their exploits, and from administrators
cursing the day I was born...  I received mail from behind the iron
curtain (while it was still standing) talking about the game on VAX's
(which supposedly couldn't be there due to export laws).  I used to
have a map with pins for every letter I received, but I gave up on
that!

I am very happy to learn my creation keeps on going...  I plan to
download it and Angband and play them...  Maybe something has been
added that will surprise me!  That would be nice...  I never got to
play Moria and be surprised...
