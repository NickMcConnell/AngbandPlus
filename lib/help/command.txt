<style:title>Commands</style>

Commands are entered using the keyboard by pressing a single key that is mapped to an underlying command interpreted by the game. This mapping of keystrokes to game commands proceeds by using one of two standard keysets: the Original Keyset and the Roguelike Keyset. If you are playing for the first time, I recommend using the Original Keyset since it is the default and is also the most intuitive (for example, you move with the arrow keys). But there are also some crazy folks that prefer a different approach ... Just kidding. The Roguelike keyset might be more ergonomic since movement is controlled with normal alphabetic keys, but, personally, I could never train myself to switch.

Once you've chosen a game command, you may be prompted for arguments or additional information. For example, if you get hungry and decide to eat some food ('E' in the Original Keyset), the game will give you a list of choices (which might include rations of food, or various mushrooms ... whatever relevant objects you have in your pack). You can cancel the command with the ESC key.

This file contains the command mappings for the two keysets listed above. For an overview of the various commands, see <link:commdesc.txt>. Also, for beginners, there is a unified command menu that is very easy to use, and you can navigate the various commands with the cursor keys, ENTER and ESC. Each command lists the keystroke for the command, so you can explore and learn as you go. Simply press ENTER to get started (You may enable/disable this feature with the 'command_menu' option. For more on setting options, see <link:option.txt>).

Don't be overwhelmed by the sheer number of commands. Many are not often used or required, and I've tried to highlight the most common commands below. You should try to memorize those, but this is easy as most commands use a mnemonic just like the Eat command discussed above. By the way, the caret (^) character in the tables below indicates pressing the CTRL key.

<topic:CommandCounts><style:heading>Command Counts</style>

Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding them with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count expires, until you type any character, or until something significant happens, such as being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn't work to attack another creature. While the command is being repeated, the number of times left to be repeated will flash by on the line at the left of the screen. <color:y>To give a count to a command, type 0, the repeat count, and then the command.</color>

Counted commands are very useful for searching or tunneling, as they automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may also terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing any character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a SPACE or ESCAPE which are always ignored as commands in case you type the command just after the count expires.

You can tell the game to automatically use a repeat count of 99 with commands you normally want to repeat (open, disarm, tunnel, bash, alter, etc) by setting the "always_repeat" option. For more information on setting options, see <link:option.txt>.

<topic:CommandArguments><style:heading>Command Arguments</style>

Some commands will prompt for extra information, such as a direction, an inventory or equipment item, a spell, a textual inscription, the symbol of a monster race, a sub-command, a verification, an amount of time, a quantity, a file name, or various other things. Normally you can hit return to choose the "default" response, or escape to cancel the command entirely.

Some commands will prompt for a direction. You may enter a "compass" direction using any of the "direction keys" shown above. Sometimes, you may specify that you wish to use the current "target", by pressing "t" or "5", or that you wish to select a new target, by pressing "*".

<topic:SelectingObjects><style:heading>Selecting and Inscribing Objects</style>

The user interface for selecting objects has been changed (for version 6.0.0). Please see <link:context_obj_prompt.txt> for a basic introduction. This section will describe using custom inscriptions to override the default object labels when prompted for an object. As such, it is a rather advanced topic.

By default, the list of object choices are labelled with letters. For equipment choices, the letters correspond to the slots of your current body type (e.g. <color:keypress>a</color> for your right hand, etc.). These choices, since they are bound to slots rather than objects, never change. Though if you switch body types (Possessor) or play in monster mode (e.g. Dragon) then the available slots will be different, so the label corresponding to a slot will change. By contrast, inventory choices (pack and quiver) are not bound to slots. Rather, the labelling will begin at 'a' every time. Since the object list is filtered for relevant objects, this means that your choices will always begin with 'a'. This is a good thing since it makes the labels more stable in response to pack reordering. For example, to eat food, you probably just need to <color:keypress>Ea</color>. In the old days, it might have been <color:keypress>Ee</color> if you were a spellcaster ... until you picked up a new spellbook and the food label switched to <color:keypress>f</color>. (Of course, if you pick up a new food type that sorts before rations of food (e.g., a Mushroom of Disease), then the label for food will shift from <color:keypress>a</color> to <color:keypress>b</color>, but this change is easily detected since the object list now contains two choices.)

You may override the default labelling using custom inscriptions. First, you can inscribe <color:keypress>@1</color> on an object and it will always be labelled with <color:keypress>1</color> no matter which command you are currently using. Of course, you can change 1 to any other number and it will work. But this form of inscription requires you to use a number for the label override rather than a letter. Second, you can inscribe <color:keypress>@Ea</color> on your food to always have it labelled with <color:keypress>a</color> when using the Eat command (<color:keypress>E</color>). The format for this type of inscription override is @<color:G>CommandLetter</color><color:R>Label</color> where the CommandLetter is the built-in letter for the command (see <link:commdesc.txt>). Label can be any letter or number.

Note that any object containing "!x" in its inscription, where "x" is the current "game command" will induce a verification prompt whenever that object is selected. Thus, inscribing, say, "!f!k!d" on an object will greatly reduce the odds of you losing it by accident, and inscribing "!*" on an object will allow you to be very paranoid about the object. You can even repeat the inscription to invoke multiple verifications if you are truly paranoid. For example, having found, say, a potion of death, you might inscribe "!q!q!q!q" just to be absolutely, positively certain you don't accidently quaff the potion. And if you do, then your fingers are even fatter than mine! (Note: You can now use <color:keypress>!sdk</color> instead of <color:keypress>!s!d!k</color> ... Both forms mean the same thing.)

While we are talking about inscriptions, there are certain object effects that can be annoying. For example, (and I hope this doesn't spoil the game for you) there are objects which randomly teleport the player away. This can be useful if you are out of other means of teleportation, but most of the time it is just plain annoying. You are prompted for the teleport, of course, but having prompts come up randomly is disturbing, and you often plow through the prompt anyway since you were in the middle of doing something else. In this case, you may inscribe "." on the object to eliminate the random teleportation.

Here is a summary of the effects of various example object inscriptions:
<style:table>
  <color:U>Inscription Effect
  =========== =====================================================</color>
      @1      Select this object whenever '1' is pressed in any cmd
     @wa      Select this object whenever 'a' is pressed after 'w'
      !*      Verify using this object for all commands
      !q      Verify using this object for the 'q' command.
      !!      Notify when the item is fully recharged
      =g      Always pickup (get) this objects. Useful for ammo.
       .      Suppress prompt for random teleportation
       $      Suppress prompt for warning
