
====== Races ======

     There are eleven different races that you may choose among, representing
most of the speaking peoples found in Tolkien's books, plus Gnomes and Half-
Giants.  Races differ in abilities, and tend to be better at some skills than at
others.

Human:
     Most widespread of all the races, humans can live just about everywhere and
do just about anything.  They have no special adjustments to stats, no special
strengths or weaknesses, and learn all skills at an average rate.  This gives
them the greatest flexibility of all races; this, combined with their solid
hitpoints, makes them effective adventurers.  Humans get small bonuses with
crossbows and have no infravision.  They probably get the best prices in stores,
on average.

Elf:
     Known as the Elder Race, Elves are famed for their knowledge and
craftsmanship.  They are somewhat lighter, weaker, and less robust than humans,
but have superior wisdom and intelligence, learn magic more easily, and are
somewhat better at most basic skills.  They are fond of bows, somewhat weak in
melee, and have no infravision.  They resist light inherently.

Hobbit:
     Hobbits are shy, retiring folk with enough good sense to share.  They are
the smallest of all the races.  Although they have few hitpoints, they are
highly resistant to magic and can sometimes endure ailments that would lay other
races low.  They are fairly poor at melee combat, but good at most other skills.
In particular, nobody can match a hobbit slinger or burglar.  Hobbits are
stealthy, perceptive, and have innate infravision.  They sustain dexterity
inherently.

Gnome:
     Gnomes are the pudgy pranksters of the dungeon; if they can kill something
in a humorous way, so much the better.  They may be small and ugly, but can
outbargain and outwit just about anyone.  They are among the frailer races, and
not powerful in combat, but are good at magic, unmatchable with devices, and
immune to paralyzation.  Gnomes are highly intelligent and have innate
infravision.

Dwarf:
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  They are strong,
wise, tough, and resistant to magic; although not very good at casting spells,
they make excellent priests and smiths.  They are better than average at melee
combat, but don't know the first thing about bows.  Dwarves have good innate
infravision and can never be blinded.  They do have one big drawback, though:
Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with
themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In
other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.

Half-Orc:
     The bastard offspring of humans and orcs, half-orcs are ugly, strong, and
have very bad attitudes.  Their magic is a little suspect, as are most of their
skills, but they know how to fight and can take as much damage as they dish out.
Half-orcs have innate infravision and resist darkness inherently.

Half-Troll:
     Half-trolls are built like blocks of granite; no other race can match their
strength or recover hitpoints as quickly.  Their combat prowess is fearsome,
they throw boulders with deadly force, and their stomach capacity is impressive.
Unfortunately, they have poor skills, need to eat a lot, and have a hard time in
stores.  Half-trolls will be bad at anything that requires heavy thinking.  They
have innate infravision and always have their strength sustained.

Dunadan   (easier to win with -- 20% penalty to score):
     Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder race surpasses
the abilities of other humans in every field and has superior vital statistics.
Despite these great advantages, they learn just as quickly as other humans do,
which makes them a great choice for players whose other characters die too
quickly.  Dunedain always have their constitution sustained.

High-Elf   (easier to win with -- 20% penalty to score):
    High-elves are undying beings dating from the beginning of the world.  They
are masters of all skills, and are agile and intelligent, although their wisdom
is sometimes suspect.  No other race is quite as good at magic.  Despite these
great advantages, they learn just as quickly as other elves do, which makes them
a great choice for players whose other characters die too quickly.  High-elves
begin their lives able to see the unseen, and have innate resistance to light.

Dark-elf:
     Some elves prefer the darkness to the light, caverns to forests, sorcery
and necromancy to the magic of nature.  Dark-elves are extremely intelligent,
make very good magicians, and can even hold their own in melee, but are not
nearly as good with missile weapons as are other elves.  Some of their other
skills are also weak.  They do, however, learn forging quickly and well.  Dark-
elves always have their intelligence sustained.

Giant:
     Eight feet tall, nine, even ten feet tall they stand, and broad in
proportion.  Giants have more hitpoints than any other race and make formidable
wrestlers.  Their high strength and constitution make them decent fighters,
especially with clubs and thrown objects, and they can readily learn magic or
object-creation.  Unfortunately, all those tales about the naivete and
clumsiness of giants have a large grain of truth to them.  No other race is less
perceptive than giants, and none is more easy to spot.


Racial adjustments to stats:

 Half-Troll    +4    -4    -1    -3    +3    -4     12        3
 Dunadan       +1    +1    +3    +2    +3    +2     10        0
 High-Elf      +1    +3    -1    +3    +1    +3     10        0
 Dark-Elf      -1    +3     0    +2    -2    -1      8        2
 Giant         +3     0    -2    -2    +2    -1     13        0

     All racial stat adjustments act as modifiers to your maximum internal
stats.  A Half-Troll, for example, can raise his internal strength to 18/140,
but his dexterity only to 18/70.

     Higher values mean that the skill is more expensive to raise.  All races
can (eventually) attain maximum level in any skill.
