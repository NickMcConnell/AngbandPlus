  all monsters. Only females can choose this personality.


***** <Lucky>

  however, he can do all things well. Only males can choose this personality.

  honor in doing so.

  Craven adventurers shoot and use devices well, and their stealth is
  impressive. But their stats and other skills are somewhat wanting.


***** <Hasty>
[[[[r|  Hasty

  A "Hasty" person edeavors to do all things quickly. Speed, rather than skill
  and patience, are paramount, and the Hasty adventure moves quickly through
  the dungeon, bungling much.
