<style:title>Dragons</style>

Dragons are powerful winged serpents. They are strong in combat, with razor-sharp claws and a bone-crushing bite; but even more legendary is their breath, which grows ever more deadly as the dragon matures.
 
Due to their non-humanoid bodies, dragons are unable to wear armor, gloves or boots; however, being creatures of magic, they may equip up to six rings. They can also wear a helmet, a light source, a cloak and an amulet. Because of these equipment restrictions, dragons may have a difficult time covering all resistances; but each dragon has at least one innate resistance, maybe even an immunity.
 
Dragons begin life in a weak form, being very young. As their bodies mature, their scales grow tough and their claws sharp. Their breaths become stronger and stronger, and they frequently gain additional magical powers and resistances. All dragons can fly, but younger dragons are not so quick as their elders.
 
With the exception of Steel Dragons, who are far less intelligent than their kin and rely on brute force only, each dragon may choose to specialize in a specific type of magic. These special dragon-magic realms do not require books to learn. The selection of a realm has a direct influence on the stats and skills of the dragon.

<topic:Red Dragon><color:o>Red Dragon</color>
Red Dragons are elemental dragons of fire, and the second-strongest fighters among dragons. Their fiery breaths are the stuff of legends with damage unsurpassed. Even their bites are likely to burn their opponents, further enhancing their deadliness in melee. As the Red Dragon matures, it becomes more and more resistant to fire, eventually gaining total immunity.

<topic:White Dragon><color:o>White Dragon</color>
White Dragons are to cold what Red Dragons are to fire. Their melee is awe-inspiring, and their icy breath can be felt even in their bite. Together with Red Dragons, they have the deadliest breaths among dragonkind; and they become more and more resistant to cold as they mature, eventually attaining immunity.

Blue Dragons are elemental dragons of lightning. Their breaths are as strong as those of their Red and White brethren, their melee somewhat weaker but still mighty, and their bites eventually shock their foes. Blue Dragons become more and more resistant to lightning as they mature, eventually gaining total immunity.

<topic:Black Dragon><color:o>Black Dragon</color>
Black Dragons are to acid what Blue Dragons are to lightning. Their breaths are as strong as those of their Red, White and Blue kin; and fewer monsters resist acid, giving them an extra opening. As the Black Dragon matures, its bites become corrosive, and it grows more resistant to acid until it reaches immunity.

Green Dragons are elemental dragons of venom. They are not quite as strong as Red or White dragons, but are still fearsome opponents. As they mature, their bites poison their enemies. Green Dragons become more and more resistant to poison over time, eventually achieving immunity.

<topic:Shadow Drake><color:o>Shadow Drake</color>
Shadow Drakes are among the stealthiest of dragons. They are creatures of nether, and eventually evolve into Death Drakes and Spectral Wyrms. Their melee is the weakest among dragonkind and their breaths are also somewhat lacking, but they still make fearsome opponents. As they advance, these dragons gain the ability to pass through walls, and acquire several resistances including immunity to nether.

<topic:Law Drake><color:o>Law Drake</color>
Law Drakes are powerful dragons of order. They can breathe sound or shards and eventually evolve into Great Wyrms of Law, though not as quickly as you might hope. Their breaths are much weaker than those of the elemental dragons, but far fewer monsters resist sound or shards. Their melee is also on the weak side by dragon standards, but most lesser creatures would be quite happy with it!

Their breaths are much weaker than those of the elemental dragons, but far fewer monsters resist chaos or disenchantment; and though their melee is weak for a dragon, by more typical standards they fight quite well.

Ethereal Drakes are dragons of light and darkness. They begin life as modest Pseudo Dragons, but quickly evolve into Ethereal Drakes and then Ethereal Dragons. As they mature, they gain the ability to pass through walls and become more and more resistant to light, darkness and confusion. They are fairly weak fighters and have the weakest breaths in all of dragonkind, except for Steel Dragons which cannot breathe at all.

<topic:Steel Dragon><color:o>Steel Dragon</color>
Steel Dragons are magical dragons formed from rock. As they mature, their form hardens from stone into steel. Needless to say, their armor class is phenomenal, but their dexterity actually decreases with maturity. Steel dragons begin life being susceptible to cold damage, though they will eventually outgrow this vulnerability. They are not as fast as other dragons and have no powers whatsoever, not even the ubiquitous dragon breath! But their fighting is impossibly strong, putting all the other dragons to complete and utter shame. They also have extremely high hitpoints.
