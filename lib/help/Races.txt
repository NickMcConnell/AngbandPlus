<style:title>The Races</style>
There are many races in the world, each, for the most part, with both strengths and weaknesses. Humans are the base race, and serve as the benchmark of comparison for all the others. In general, the stronger a race is relative to humans, the higher the <color:keyword>Experience Penalty</color> and the longer it will take to gain levels.

For details on the <color:keyword>Primary Statistics</color>, see <link:birth.txt#PrimaryStats>. For information about the various <color:keyword>Skills</color>, see <link:birth.txt#PrimarySkills>. The skill descriptions in this document are for comparison purposes only. For example, your fledgling high-elf will not be born with <color:v>Legendary[2]</color> device skill. In general, skills are influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. To compare the various races, you might want to take a look at <link:Races.txt#Tables> the race tables below.

  <indent><topic:Amberite><color:o>Amberite</color>
The Amberites are a reputedly immortal race, who are endowed with numerous advantages in addition to their longevity. They are very tough and their constitution cannot be reduced, and their ability to heal wounds far surpasses that of any other race. Having seen virtually everything, very little is new to them, and they gain levels much slower than the other races.

<topic:Barbarian><color:o>Barbarian</color>
Barbarians are hardy men of the north. They are fierce in combat, and their wrath is feared throughout the world. Combat is their life: they feel no fear, and they learn to enter battle frenzy at will even sooner than half-trolls. Barbarians are, however, suspicious of magic, which makes magic devices fairly hard for them to use.

The human is the base character. All other races are compared to them. Humans are average at everything and also tend to go up levels faster than most other races because of their shorter life spans. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human. However, humans may choose special talents at L20 & 40 that more than make up for their overall mediocrity.

High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of time. They are masters of all skills, and are strong and intelligent, although their wisdom is sometimes suspect. High-elves begin their lives able to see the unseen, and resist light effects just like regular elves. However, there are few things that they have not seen already, and experience is very hard for them to gain.

Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise, they resist spells which are cast on them. They are very good at searching, perception, fighting, and bows. Dwarves have miserable stealth. They resist being blinded.

Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than Halflings. They, like the hobbits, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans so they are not very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Gnomes are intrinsically protected against paralysis.

They are much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting. Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a distance.

Shadow Fairies are one of the several fairy races. They have wings, and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them. Shadow Fairies must beware of sunlight, as they are vulnerable to bright light. They are physically weak, but have advantages in using magic and are amazingly stealthy. Shadow Fairies have a wonderful advantage in that they never aggravate monsters (If their equipment normally aggravates monsters, they only suffer a penalty to stealth, but if they aggravate by their personality itself, the advantage will be lost).

Half-Giants limited intelligence makes it difficult for them to become full spellcasters, but with their huge strength they make excellent warriors. Their thick skin makes them resistant to shards, and like Half-Trolls, they have their strength sustained.

Ogres are big and ugly but possessed of a low cunning and great strength. For warriors, they have all the necessary attributes, and they can even become wizards: after all, they are related to Ogre Magi, from whom they have learned the skill of setting trapped runes once their level is high enough. Being simple minded they have their intelligence sustained

Half - orcs make excellent warriors, but are terrible at magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Half - orcs are quite ugly, and tend to pay more for goods in town. Because of their preference to living underground to on the surface, half - orcs resist darkness attacks. The human part of their heritage allows them to select a talent at Level 30.

Half-mortal descendants of the mighty titans, these immensely powerful creatures put almost any other race to shame. They may lack the fascinating special powers of certain other races, but their enhanced attributes more than make up for that. They learn to estimate the strengths of their foes, and their love for law and order makes them resistant to the effects of Chaos.

Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than most other races. They are also very stupid and slow. They are bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. They also happen to be fun to run... Half-trolls always have their strength sustained. Half-Trolls regenerate wounds automatically.

<style:heading>The Undead</style>
  <indent><topic:Skeleton><color:o>Skeleton</color>
There are two types of skeletons: the ordinary, warrior-like skeletons, and the spell-using skeletons, which are also called liches. As undead beings, skeletons need to worry very little about poison or attacks that can drain life. They do not really use eyes for perceiving things, and are thus not fooled by invisibility. Their bones are resistant to sharp shrapnel, and they will quickly become resistant to cold. Although the magical effects of these will affect the skeleton even without entering the skeleton's (non-existent) belly, the potion or food itself will fall through the skeleton's jaws, giving no nutritional benefit. They can absorb mana from staves and wands as their energy source.

Another powerful undead creature: the Spectre is a ghastly apparition, surrounded by an unearthly green glow. They exist only partially on our plane of existence: half-corporeal, they can pass through walls, although the density of the wall will hurt them in the process of doing this. As undead, they have a firm hold on their life force, see invisible, and resist poison and cold. They also resist nether. Spectres make superb spellcasters, but their physical form is very weak. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but can absorb mana from staves and wands as their energy source.

<topic:Vampire><color:o>Vampire</color>
One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an awe-inspiring sight. Yet this dread creature has a serious weakness: the bright rays of sun are its bane, and it will need to flee the surface to the deep recesses of earth until the sun finally sets. Darkness, on the other hand, only makes the Vampire stronger. As undead, the Vampire has a firm hold on its life force, and resists nether attacks. The Vampire also resists cold and poison based attacks. It is, however, susceptible to its perpetual hunger for fresh blood, which can only be satiated by sucking the blood from a nearby monster.

Zombies are undead horrors, resistant to life draining and the forces of the netherworld. The grave is cold but this does not bother the undead and poison scarcely affects the unliving.

An android is a artificial creation with a body of machinery. Over the millenia, artificial intelligence has improved to the point where androids are nearly as smart as humans, though perhaps not so wise. Of course, their mechanical body offers great physical advantages, far surpassing the powers of man. Androids don't acquire experience like other races, but rather gain in power as they attach new equipment to their frame. Rings, amulets, and lights do not influence growth. Androids are resistant to poison, can move freely, and are immune to life-draining attacks. Moreover, because of their hard metallic bodies, they get a bonus to AC. Androids have electronic circuits throughout their body and must beware of electric shocks. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but they can use flasks of oil as their energy source.

This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos. It is not an independent race but rather a humanoid creature, most often a human, twisted by the Chaos, or a nightmarish crossbreed of a human and a beast. All Beastmen are accustomed to Chaos so much that they are untroubled by confusion and sound, although raw logrus can still have effects on them. Beastmen revel in chaos, as it twists them more and more. Beastmen are subject to mutations: when they have been created, they receive a random mutation. After that, every time they advance a level they have a small chance of gaining yet another mutation.

Centaurs are creatures with the head, arms and torso of a human combined with the body and legs of a horse. As such, they are able to move more quickly as they gain experience and are capable of leaping great distances. They may attack monsters with their hooves in addition to any normal melee weapons. Centaurs are strong, agile, and wise, but not so smart. They are skilled in fighting and archery but are rather distrustful of magic. Finally, being at home in the forests of the world, Centaurs are able to move quickly through foliage.

Draconians are a humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. There are several subtypes of draconians with different resistances, breaths and attributes. For example, Red Draconians are resistant to fire which they may also breathe at will, while White Draconians breathe and resist cold instead. All draconians levitate. In addition, when they mature enough, they may choose a special draconian power.

See <link:Draconians.txt> for more details on draconians.

The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the world, oldest of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda. Spirits of the land, they were summoned to guard the forests of Middle-earth. Being much like trees they are very clumsy but strong, and very susceptible to fire. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but they can absorb water from potions as their nutrition. Finally, they can summon the trees of the forest to their side.

<topic:Golem><color:o>Golem</color>
A Golem is an artificial creature, built from a lifeless raw material like clay, and awakened to life. They are nearly mindless, making them useless for professions which rely on magic, but as warriors they are very tough. They are resistant to poison, they can see invisible things, and move freely. At higher levels, they also become resistant to attacks which threaten to drain away their life force. Golems gain very little nutrition from ordinary food, but can absorb mana from staves and wands as their power source. Golems also gain a natural armor class bonus from their tough body. Golems become slower with age.

<topic:Klackon><color:o>Klackon</color>
Klackons are bizarre semi-intelligent ant-like insectoid creatures. They make great fighters, but their mental abilities are severely limited. Obedient and well-ordered, they are resistant to confusion. They are also very nimble, and become faster as they advance levels. They are also very acidic, inherently resisting acid, and capable of spitting acid at higher levels.

<topic:Kutar><color:o>Kutar</color>
A Kutar is an expressionless animal-like living creature. The word 'kuta' means 'absentmindedly' or 'vacantly'. Their absentmindedness hurts their searching and perception skills, but renders them resistant to being confused. Their unearthly calmness and serenity make them among the most stealthy of any race. Kutars, although expressionless, are beautiful and so have a high charisma. Members of this race can learn to expand their body horizontally. This increases armour class, but renders them vulnerable to magical attacks.

<topic:Mindflayer><color:o>Mindflayer</color>
Mindflayers are a secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their civilization may well be older than any other on our planet, and their intelligence and wisdom are naturally sustained, and are so great that they enable Mindflayers to become more powerful spellcasters than any other race, even if their physical attributes are a good deal less admirable. As they advance levels, they gain the powers of See Invisible and Telepathy.

<topic:Tonberry><color:o>Tonberry</color>
Tonberries are lizard-like creatures who possess enormous strength and have a preference for cleavers and large knives. They are, however, sluggish in their movements and reactions; young and inexperienced tonberries are often preyed on by the other races. They possess human-like intelligence, but rarely become mages due to their culture and physiology. Tonberries attack very powerfully in melee, albeit with fewer attacks than normal. They are also easily confused and move with reduced speed.

<topic:Yeek><color:o>Yeek</color>
Yeeks are among the most pathetic creatures. Fortunately, their horrible screams can scare away less confident foes, and their skin becomes more and more resistant to acid, as they gain experience. But having said that, even a mediocre monster can wipe the proverbial floor with an unwary Yeek.
