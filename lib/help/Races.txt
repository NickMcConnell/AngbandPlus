<style:title>The Races</style>
There are many races in the world, each, for the most part, with both strengths and weaknesses. In general, the stronger a race is, the higher its <color:keyword>Experience Penalty</color> and the longer it will take to gain levels.

For details on the <color:keyword>Stats</color>, see <link:birth.txt#PrimaryStats>. For information about the <color:keyword>Skills</color>, see <link:birth.txt#PrimarySkills>. The skill descriptions in this document are <color:v>for comparison purposes only</color>; they will tell you how good a race is compared to other races, but should not be taken as a literal indicator of the skill level your fledgling character will be born with. In general, skills are influenced by level, race, class, stats and equipment. See the race tables <link:Races.txt#Tables> below for a quick comparison of the various races.

  <indent><topic:Amberite><color:o>Amberite</color>
The Amberites are a reputedly immortal race, who are endowed with numerous advantages in addition to their longevity. They are very tough and their constitution cannot be reduced, and their ability to recover from wounds surpasses most other races. Having seen virtually everything, very little is new to them, and so they gain levels relatively slowly.

<topic:Barbarian><color:o>Barbarian</color>
Barbarians are hardy men of the north; they are fierce in combat, and their wrath is feared throughout the world. Combat is their life: they feel no fear, and they learn to enter battle frenzy at will even sooner than half-trolls. Barbarians are, however, suspicious of magic, which makes magic devices fairly hard for them to use. Barbarians gain a demigod talent at level 30.

The term demigod is commonly used to describe mythological figures whose one parent was a god and whose other parent was human; as such, demigods are human-god hybrids and are quite powerful. Demigods receive special abilities depending on their parentage.

See <link:Demigods.txt> for more details on demigod parentage.

Humans are average at everything, and tend to gain levels rapidly due to their short life spans. No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human. However, humans may select special talents at levels 20 and 40 that more than make up for their apparent mediocrity.

The epitome of a self-made man, an Igor is generally easily recognizable by the ring of stitches around his neck, the tendency to limp with perfectly healthy legs, and the mysterious ability to appear suddenly and then disappear when the mob comes looking. An Igor is at home with lightning, and always carries a bag full of ice in case he should find something that needs to be kept cold.

A cave-dwelling race unhampered by darkness attacks, dark-elves have more in common with Nibelungs than with other elves. They have a great capacity for magic and spellcasting, and learn the Magic Missile spell at a low level regardless of their class. With their keen sight, they soon acquire the ability to see invisible things.

<topic:High-Elf><color:o>High-Elf</color>
High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of time. They are masters of all skills, and are strong and intelligent, although their wisdom is sometimes suspect. High-elves begin their lives able to see the unseen, and resist light effects just like regular elves. However, there are few things that they have not seen already, so new levels are quite hard for them to gain.

Smaller and of lighter build than regular elves, Tomtes are nimble, intelligent, extremely stealthy and at home with magical devices, but their size handicaps them in physical combat. They greatly prefer light headwear, and cannot think clearly with a heavy helmet squeezing their brains. Tomtes have the ability to assess monsters and items at a glance (they gain auto-identify at level 40); and being accustomed to long winters, they are not much bothered by cold.

Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. They tend to be strong and tough, but lack agility. Because they are so headstrong and also somewhat wise, dwarves are relatively resistant to evil curses cast on them. They are very good at fighting, searching and perception, and resist being blinded, but infamously have miserable stealth.

Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than hobbits; and like hobbits, they live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent mages, and have very good saving throws. They are naturally skilled at most things, but not very strong or good at hand-to-hand fighting. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, allowing them to detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance. They are also intrinsically protected against paralysis.

Hobbits (or Halflings) have exceptional stealth and are very good at bows and throwing; indeed, they are generally well-suited for the adventuring life. Yet their small size is a handicap at times; they are not very good at melee fighting, and cannot suffer as many hard hits as larger races. Hobbits are known for their love of good cooking, and have an almost miraculous ability to find food in the dark depths of the dungeon.

Shadow-fairies are one of the several fairy races. They have wings, and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them. Being creatures of darkness, shadow-fairies are vulnerable to bright light. They are physically weak, but naturally adept at using magic. Shadow-fairies are amazingly stealthy, and have a wonderful advantage in that they almost never aggravate monsters; aggravating equipment only gives them a slight penalty to stealth, but if they have an aggravating personality the advantage is lost.

Sprites have the special power of spraying Sleeping Dust, and at higher levels they learn to fly faster.

<topic:Balrog><color:o>Balrog</color>
Balrogs are a higher class of demons. They are strong, intelligent and tough, but lacking in wisdom and not suitable for priesthood. Balrogs are resistant to fire and nether, and have a firm hold on their life force; they also soon learn to see invisible things. They are good at almost all skills except stealth. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, and need human corpses as sacrifices to regain their vitality.

A demon-creature from the nether-world, naturally resistant to fire attacks, and capable of learning fire bolt and fire ball attacks. They are little loved by other races, but can perform fairly well in most professions. As they advance levels, they gain the ability to perceive invisible creatures.

Half-orcs make excellent warriors, but are terrible at magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Being accustomed to living underground, half-orcs are resistant to darkness attacks. Half-orcs are quite ugly, and so tend to pay more for goods in town. The human part of their heritage allows them to select a talent at level 30.

Half-mortal descendants of the mighty titans, these immensely powerful creatures put almost any other race to shame. They may lack the fascinating special powers some other races have, but their enhanced attributes more than make up for that. They learn to estimate the strengths of their foes, and their love for law and order makes them resistant to the effects of Chaos.

Half-trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than most other races. They are very stupid, and bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth; but they make excellent fighters despite their poor agility. They are so ugly that a half-orc grimaces in their presence. They also happen to be fun to run... Half-trolls always have their strength sustained, and their regeneration is exceptionally fast.

Beornings are a hardy, northern race of men, renowned for their ability to assume the shape of a bear. Bear-formed Beornings greatly resemble Berserkers: they are extremely strong in melee and very hard to kill, but incapable of reading scrolls, casting spells or using magical devices. Man-shaped Beornings are still stronger in combat than a regular human, but somewhat lacking in magical skills.

The equipment slots available to a Beorning depend on their shape, and like Werewolves, they carry a special satchel for keeping the items not needed in their current shape.

Werewolves are fearsome hunters who can assume either human or wolf shape. They are exceptionally durable in both forms, and have great powers of regeneration, though they are infamously vulnerable to fire and silver, and are not particularly good at using magical spells or devices in either shape. While in wolf form, werewolves wield no weapons; instead, they attack with their teeth and claws. As werewolves wear different equipment in human form and wolf form, they use one inventory slot for a special satchel in which they keep the items not needed in their current shape.

Dead heroes returning to the mortal world for one last fight, Einherjar are highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and start with the ability to enter a battle frenzy; however, they are also passably good at using devices, and do not necessarily make weak magic users. Already having one lifetime's adventures behind them, Einherjar are very strong at the beginning but learn new things slowly. Like other undead races, they are immune to life draining. Einherjar have one serious weakness: magical healing only has a partial effect on them, healing them half as much as it would any other race.

As undead beings, skeletons need worry very little about poison or attacks that can drain life. Skeletons do not really use eyes for perceiving things, and are thus not fooled by invisibility. Their bones are resistant to sharp shrapnel, and they will quickly become resistant to cold. Although the magical effects of potions and mushrooms will affect the skeleton even without entering its (non-existent) belly, the food itself will fall through the skeleton's jaws, giving no nutritional benefit; instead, skeletons feed themselves by absorbing the energy of magical devices.

A powerful undead creature, the Spectre is a ghastly apparition, surrounded by an unearthly green glow. Spectres exist only partially on our plane of existence: half-corporeal, they can pass through walls, although the density of the wall will hurt them in the process of doing this. As undead, they have a firm hold on their life force, can see invisible creatures, and resist poison, cold and nether. Spectres make superb spellcasters, but their physical form is very weak. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but can absorb mana from magical devices as their energy source.

One of the mightier undead creatures, the vampire is an awe-inspiring sight. Yet this dread creature has a serious weakness: the bright rays of sun are its bane, and it will need to flee the surface to the deep recesses of earth until the sun finally sets. Darkness, on the other hand, holds few terrors to a vampire. Being undead, vampires also resist nether, cold and poison and have a firm hold on their life force; but they are susceptible to a perpetual hunger for fresh blood, which can only be satiated by sucking the blood from a nearby monster.

<topic:Zombie><color:o>Zombie</color>
Zombies are undead horrors, resistant to life draining and the forces of the netherworld. The grave is cold, but this does not bother the undead, and poison also scarcely affects the unliving. Zombies gain little nutrition from ordinary food; instead, they absorb energy from magical devices to maintain their undead existence.

  <indent><topic:Android><color:o>Android</color>
An android is an artificial creation with a body of machinery. Their intelligence almost matches that of organic races, though their wisdom is no better than that of Golems. Of course, their mechanical body offers great physical advantages, far surpassing the powers of man. Uniquely among all races, Androids do not acquire experience from killing monsters, but rather gain in power as they attach new equipment to their frame. Rings, amulets, and lights do not influence growth. Androids are resistant to poison and immune to life-draining attacks; moreover, because of their hard metallic bodies, they get a bonus to AC. Androids have electronic circuits throughout their body, and so must beware of electric shocks. They gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but can use flasks of oil as their energy source.

<topic:Beastman><color:o>Beastman</color>
This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos. It is not an independent race but rather a humanoid creature, most often a human, twisted by Chaos; or else a nightmarish crossbreed of a human and a beast. All Beastmen are accustomed to Chaos so much that they are untroubled by confusion and sound, although raw Logrus can still hurt them. Beastmen revel in chaos, as it twists them more and more. Beastmen are subject to mutations: when they have been created, they receive a random mutation, and have a small chance to gain more mutations every time they advance a level. Unlike normal races, Beastmen can have many mutations without ill effects on their regeneration.

Boits are small bipedal creatures covered in yellow, lilac, brown or green fur, distantly related to the Yeeks. Boits move speedily, and can eject the contents of their stomachs at will, but they are not particularly well-suited for melee, ranged combat, use of magical devices, or spellcasting.

<topic:Centaur><color:o>Centaur</color>
Centaurs are creatures with the head, arms and torso of a human combined with the body and legs of a horse. As such, they are able to move more quickly as they gain experience and are capable of leaping great distances. Centaurs are skilled in fighting and archery and can attack monsters with their hooves in addition to normal melee weapons; but lacking normal feet, they cannot wear boots. Being at home in the forests of the world, Centaurs are able to move quickly through foliage.

<topic:Draconian><color:o>Draconian</color>
Draconians are a humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. There are several subtypes of draconians with different resistances, breaths and attributes; for example, Red Draconians are resistant to fire which they may also breathe at will, while White Draconians breathe and resist cold instead. All draconians levitate. In addition, when they mature enough, they may choose a special draconian power.

See <link:Draconians.txt> for more details on draconians.

<topic:Ent><color:o>Ent</color>
The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the world, oldest of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda. Spirits of the land, they guard the forests of Middle-earth. Being much like trees, they are strong but very clumsy, and highly susceptible to fire. Ents gain nourishment from drinking water; the food of mortals is of little use to them. Ents have the special ability to summon the trees of the forest to their side.

<topic:Golem><color:o>Golem</color>
A Golem is an artificial creature, built from a lifeless raw material like clay, and awakened to life. They are nearly mindless, making them useless for professions which rely on magic, but as warriors they are very tough. They are resistant to poison and paralysis and can see invisible things. At higher levels, they also become resistant to attacks which threaten to drain away their life force. Golems gain very little nutrition from ordinary food, but can absorb mana from staves and wands as their power source. Golems also gain a natural armor class bonus from their tough body. Golems become slower with age.

Klackons are bizarre semi-intelligent ant-like insectoid creatures. They make great fighters, but their mental abilities are severely limited. Obedient and well-ordered, they are resistant to confusion. They are very nimble, and become faster as they advance levels. They are also very acidic, inherently resist acid, and become capable of spitting it at higher levels.

<topic:Kutar><color:o>Kutar</color>
A Kutar is not a dog, cat or bear. Despite their characteristic vacant expression, Kutars are beautiful and so have a high charisma. Their absent-mindedness hurts their searching and perception skills, but renders them resistant to being confused. Due to their unearthly calmness and serenity, Kutars are extremely stealthy. They learn the special ability to expand their body horizontally; this increases their armour class, but renders them vulnerable to curses.

Mindflayers are a secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their civilization may well be older than any other; their intelligence and wisdom are naturally sustained, and so great as to make Mindflayers highly effective spellcasters, but their physical attributes are a good deal less admirable. As they gain levels, they learn to see invisible creatures, and eventually develop a telepathic sight.

Tonberries are lizard-like creatures who possess enormous strength and have a preference for cleavers and large knives. They are, however, sluggish in their movements and reactions; young and inexperienced tonberries are often preyed on by the other races. They possess human-like intelligence, but rarely become mages due to their culture and physiology. Tonberries attack very powerfully in melee, albeit with fewer attacks than normal. They are also easily confused and move with reduced speed.

They are also fairly good at magic; but in combat, even a mediocre monster can wipe the proverbial floor with an unwary Yeek.
