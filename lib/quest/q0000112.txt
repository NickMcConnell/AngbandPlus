Q:112:T:The Healers are delighted that you found the Arkenstone of Thrain. They
Q:112:T:asked that you be entrusted with its care until the upcomming war.
Q:112:T:I share their trust and hope that it will serve you well. Morgoth has
Q:112:T:heard of your great deeds and has sent Uldor the Accursed to deal with 
Q:112:T:you. Uldor sent a messenger to the captain of the guard and issued a
Q:112:T:challenge to you. He has made camp in the old Guardhouse in the ruins.
Q:112:T:You should accept his challenge and send his head back to Morgoth.
