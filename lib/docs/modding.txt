Preamble
This document covers the text configuration files held in the lib/edit directory and how to modify 
them.

Overview of the Lib/Edit Files
Unangband takes a data driven approach to much of the game design. May game rules are 
abstracted into external edit files which are contained in the lib/edit subdirectory. These files are 
parsed in using code within init1.c and then turned into binary data which is then reparsed in 
init2.c. The binary data is held in the lib/data subdirectory with a .raw file corresponding to each .txt 
file in lib/edit.
This allows high performance loading of the data contained in the edit files in a platform 
independent manner - they are only reparsed in the event the edit file date is newer than the data 
file date, or the Unangband version number increased. If you change the internal Unangband code 
to read these files or the type definitions of any data structure used in these files, you should 
delete the .raw files before reloading - otherwise you may end up with unusual errors due to bad 
data which could potentially crash the game and/or corrupt save files and other data.
Although game logic is contained in the edit files, it is not equivalent to scripting. The edit file 
language is simple, consisting of comment lines, starting with a symbol, blank lines and data 
definition lines. The data definition lines almost always act as defining part of a row of a data table. 
This is almost always a large array of elements of a C structure. e.g. the monster.txt file defines a 
large array of elements of monster_race. The edit files are simply a way of extending the existing 
tables.c file to include a lot more elements, and should be read in conjunction with the relevant 
structures defined in types.h and with heavy use of grep to determine where the data and 
structures are used in the Unangband code.
The Unangband table based data design would be better supported in a SQL like language, or Lisp 
or even extended with Lua or another scripting language. Unangband may be rewritten using one 
of these languages at some point. The paper Scaling Games to Epic Proportions 
(http://www.cs.cornell.edu/%7Ewmwhite/papers/2007-SIGMOD-Games.pdf) discusses a SQL like 
language supporting game elements on a massive scale that may be of interest. Avoiding scripting 
is not without complications in the game design, but at the moment there are no compelling 
reasons to make Unangband support scripting.
A data definition line starts with a letter followed by a colon, followed by either one or more colon 
separated fields, or flags separated by white space and vertical bars (|). There are three basic 
types of edit file: indexed files, Markov chained files, and table files.
In the first type of file, the data is organised in blocks starting with a N: data line, which defines 
data block as corresponding to the nth element of the array, and usually the name of the element. 
e.g.
N:1:the first element
A:1:2:3
B:4:5
F:FIRST_FLAG | SECOND_FLAG

N:2:the second element
etc.
These are used where the index is important, such as when referring to a particular monster race 
or character class number.

The second type consists of array elements that are strung together using a Markov chain 
approach. The first line of each element usually defines the block number, and a simple algorithm 
goes through the array, finds elements corresponding to the same block and picks one, then 
chooses the next block based on selection criteria within the element chosen, and repeats until a 
block number of 0 is chosen. These files usually build a sentence such as a room description, or 
character history. Because of the design of these files, the unique element number is not as 
important, so it is not usually defined in the file.
The third type is where the file builds a table. Each line corresponds to one row of the table, with 
numeric values separated by colons corresponding to each column.
To emphasise: the data structure in all three types is an array of elements of a C structure - it's just 
a matter of how the information is presented in the file and parsed is slightly different.
String values in the files are stored as indexes into a separate chunk of contiguous zero byte 
delimited strings. Each string currently has a unique index even though the string may be 
potentially duplicated elsewhere in the file. Usually two separate chunks of strings are used for a 
file: one for names, and one for descriptions. During the parsing process in init1.c, a maximal size 
chunk is allocated using malloc, the size of which is defined in lib/edit/limits.txt - and then once the 
size is known, it is written to the .raw file so that the correct size is allocated when the .raw file is 
read in.
It is possible to build a distribution of Unangband which does not allow the lib/edit files to be 
parsed. To do this, disable the ALLOW_TEMPLATES define in config.h and distribute Unangband 
with the .raw files in lib/data. Note that this distribution is now heavily dependent on the 
endianess and integer size of the machine it is created on, so you should ensure that this is a binary 
only distribution.
There is some in game calculations used in the lib/edit files as well. For instance, level, rarity and 
experience reward for monsters is algorithmically determined. To output a new copy of the edit 
files containing the generated values, enable ALLOW_TEMPLATES_OUTPUT and the edit files will 
be output to the lib/user directory when the game launches. Note that e.g. level is dependent on 
power, which can depend on level, so that the depths for monsters you have not changed will also 
vary in the output file.
Customising the Existing Lib/Edit Files
The edit files are a gateway drug: they exist to allow players to modify the game without requiring 
an understanding of coding or compilation. The edit files in Angband are the reason there are so 
many variants of Angband – it is very easy for a player to modify one or more entries in an edit file 
to customise the game to their liking, and then progressively change the game so that it becomes a 
full variant. Outside the Angband community, these would be called mods or total conversions.
An understanding of the ability to read code is highly recommended if you wish to customise the 
existing edit files. This is for several reasons:
*	The edit files themselves are incompletely documented. This file is an attempt to rectify 
part of that issue.
*	Unangband is a work-in-progress and constantly evolving. This means that the SVN 
repository is the best place to get a view of the developer intentions, and the released 
source code for the version you are playing the best reference for specific implementation 
of the edit files.
*	Documentation can at only at best discuss the code at a high level. For an exact 
understanding of how the edit files interact and features of these files, the source code 
and generated executables are your primary reference.
Luckily the Angband code base is well documented, a tradition that Unangband attempts to 
continue, although has done so in fits and starts. Refer to the ‘Related Source Code Files’ section 
below for a guide to reading the source code in conjunction with the edit files.
Customising the edit files is ‘simply’ a matter of making a change to the .txt file, saving it and 
restarting Angband. This will automatically update the corresponding .raw file as a part of the game 
start up. Various checks are made to ensure that the changes parse correctly, but not a lot of data 
bounds checking is enabled, so it is relatively easy to crash the Unangband executable, by putting 
invalid entries in the edit files.
If you wish to add entries to the end of a particular edit file, you’ll need to edit limits.txt. This file 
covers the initialisation of a number of maximum entries in each of the other edit files, as well as 
upper bounds for dynamically allocated memory for holding the text and descriptions for the 
majority of these files, and a few other values (e.g. the maximum numbers of monsters and 
objects on a dungeon level).
You should familiarise yourself with the game-play first, and then reading the edit files, before you 
make any changes. This will give you a good feeling for how changing the edit files makes 
corresponding changes in game. A common first attempt may be to make easy monsters have 
powerful or valuable drops, by adding various DROP_ flags to the monster type. Equally, Morgoth 
can be made very weak and easy to defeat as well as appearing much early in the dungeon, 
allowing you to achieve impressive speed runs.
You’ll quickly learn (unless you are of a certain frame of mind), that changing the edit files to win 
the game quickly ruins the experience for you, and you should refrain from trying this, or even 
peeking at the information contained inside, to discover the surprises ahead. Unfortunately, this 
temptation is often too great – and a challenge that few open source games are likely to be able to 
overcome. But with the rise of sites like gamefaqs.com and programs like Glider, the same 
information sharing challenge is faced by commercial games as well. Luckily, the procedural 
generation, randomness and other roguelike features such as perma death ensure that 
Unangband remains a challenge, even with complete knowledge of the game rules.
The edit files are not as expressive as a full scripting language and you’ll find that there are a 
number of cases where various values in the edit file have hard-coded dependencies in the game 
code, or interact in unexpected ways. Unangband has tried to reduce the number of instances 
where this happens in the ‘core’ Angband edit files, but at the same time feature creep has meant 
that overall it is probably just as bad, if not worse than Angband itself. This documentation 
attempts to address this. Each file has a corresponding section in this document, which discusses 
the specifics of customising a file and how the file interacts with other lib/edit files and the game 
engine (compiled source code).
Creating an New Edit File
The data driven design process often extends to designing new features in an edit file before 
implementing them in code. The free form data design technique may not be particularly hi-tech, 
but it does allow concepts to be explored from a data-centric point of view, without requiring any 
code to be written.

You should download and use the tool grep for determining where in the source code a particular 
value is used. For historical reasons, the data structure corresponding to an edit file has a different 
name. The lib/edit file and corresponding data structures and data types are in the table below:

Artifact.txt
Overview
Artifact.txt defines the list of artifacts in the game. An artifact is a unique object that can be found 
and identified only once in the game. Once the artifact name has learnt and subsequently left on a 
dungeon level, it can never be found again. Note that this identification requirement corresponds 
to the old “preserve” mode from Angband.
Artifacts are typically more powerful than the equivalent object or ego item found on the level 
(permitted artifact power is twice that of an object and one and a third that of an ego item on the 
equivalent level – see randart.c for details of how this is computed for artifacts and object_power 
in object2.c for others). Artifacts are divided into three distinct types: “special” artifacts which 
consist of items other than armor or weapons, normal artifacts, and random artifacts.
The random artifact set is generated from the base artifact set at the start of each game, and tops 
up the total number of artifacts in the game to 255. The random artifact algorithm is complex, and 
covered in randart.c. You can choose various birth options to allow you to share the same artifact 
set between multiple games, as well as ensure all artifacts, including the special artifacts, are 
randomly generated.
Generation of artifacts in game occurs in two different places in the code in object2.c, depending 
on whether the artifact is a “special” artifact or not. Special artifacts are created when the ‘base 
item’ from object.txt is created according to the standard object creation rules, and instantly 
turned into an artifact. This means that every “special” artifact needs a corresponding unique 
object defined in object.txt.
Otherwise, artifacts are created if a created armour or weapon passes several checks, and then all 
artifacts from this file that match the weapon or armour type must pass a rarity test to see if the 
object in question converts into an artifact. The match is determined on the tval and sval values 
specified for the artifact matching a generated base object, so that deep artifacts which depend on 
shallow base objects are less likely to be created than their rarity suggests.
Note that monsters with DROP_GOOD and particularly DROP_GREAT are much more likely to carry 
artifacts than other monsters.  This has led to various types of artifact scumming behaviour in the 
past which relies on the fact that artifacts cannot be destroyed or picked up by monsters. While 
cloned and breeding monster offspring no longer carry additional objects to restrict many of this 
type of exploit, it is still possible with various summoned monsters.
The player can determine an object is an artifact in a number of ways: examples include sensing 
that it is an artifact or special item, noting that it cannot be destroyed, seeing that it has a Unique 
rune and identifying the name and recognising it as a name of an artifact that they have seen or 
heard of previously. It is important to be careful of the interaction between item sensing and 
artifact “preservation” so that the name of an artifact is not learned prior to the player actively 
identifying the artifact, and therefore allowing the artifact to be lost.
General notes
Note for historical reasons the misspelling of artefact as artifact throughout Unangband, that has 
been inherited from Angband.
The artifact indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed (This may no longer 
apply).
Hack -- "Grond" and "Morgoth" MUST have a rarity of one, or they might not be dropped when 
Morgoth is killed.  Note that they, like the "special" artifacts, are never created "accidentally".
Artifact.txt entry format
N: serial number : item name
I: tval : sval : pval
W: depth : rarity : weight : cost
P: base armor class : base damage : plus to-hit : plus to-dam : plus to-ac
F: flag | flag | etc
A: activation : recharge time : recharge time dice
D: description
Understanding artifact.txt entries
'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must increase for each new item.
'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the sval identifies the subtype and the 
pval indicates the amount of effect the item has, if applicable.
'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is normally found at, rarity determines 
how common the object is, weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the item's value.
'P' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam 
and to-ac.
'F' is for flags. These are common to the object.txt, artifact.txt and ego_item.txt files. As many F: 
lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags are separated by the '|' symbol. 
Note that all artifacts cannot be destroyed and so implicitly have the IGNORE_ type flags.
'A' is for activation.  Activation is the effect the artifact activates for, referring to an entry number in 
spell.txt. The recharge time calculates from the recharge time plus a random value between 1 and 
the recharge time dice (if not 0). If an activation is given then the artifact must also have the 
ACTIVATE flag. Artifact weapons with activations can also be inscribed with =A by the player which 
will mean that the activation is used against the monster that the artifact hits, provided the 
activation has recharged.
‘D’ is for description. The artifact description should provide information about the history and/or 
owner of the artefact, as opposed spoilerish information about its powers. Contrast this with e.g. 
the artifact descriptions in T.o.M.E.
Customising this file
Any changes or additions to the file will have influence on randarts and may break savefile 
compatibility for old savegames with randarts.  If using random artifacts, finish your existing game 
before making any changes to the artifact.txt file at all.
Removing any artifact, or changing its "base" type (as defined by the tval and sval entries in the "I:" 
line), will break savefile compatibility for ALL savefiles.
Adding a new artifact, or changing the powers of existing ones, will NOT affect savefile 
compatibility for games with the standard artifact set: it is perfectly safe to do this. (If your new 
artifact is a new kind of object, or a new one at the end of the file, you must also amend object.txt 
or limits.txt.)
“Special” artifacts are artefacts that are not weapons or armor. Only the first 15 artifacts may be of 
these types currently: artifacts from index number 16 onwards must be Armor or Weapons. (This 
may no longer apply).
Note a few entries are used in hard-coded ways: namely the entries for Grond and the Iron Crown 
of Morgoth are dropped specifically.
When designing an artifact, consider strongly how it will be uniquely useful in the game. There are 
probably already too many artifacts in Angband and Unangband, and additions are likely to be 
either overpowered or not distinguishable from the large selection already available, or lesser 
powered ego or magic items. Artifacts with a mixture of good abilities with some negative side 
effects, or interesting activations, are worth considering, as are artifact staffs or diggers, and 
armour other than body armour.

Ego_Item.txt
Overview
Ego_item.txt defines the list of ego items in the game. An ego item is an object that has additional 
flags applied to it beyond that possible by applying runes or spells to the item, without having the 
power of an artifact. Note that it is possible to use runes to upgrade an item to an ego item.
Ego items are typically more powerful than the equivalent object or found on the level (permitted 
ego item power is one and a half times that of a equivalent object – see object_power in object2.c 
for details). There is also code to ensure that the ego item reaches a minimum power level if 
generated, including selection of the appropriate random ego ability and boosting the to hit, to 
damage, to ac and item pval as appropriate.
Generation of ego items in game occurs in object2.c, and occur if a created armour or weapon 
passes several checks, and then all ego items from this file that match the weapon or armour type 
must pass a rarity test to see if the object in question converts into the ego item. The match is 
determined on the tval and sval ranges specified for the ego item matching a generated base 
object, so that deep ego items which depend on the creation of shallow base objects are less likely 
to be created than their rarity suggests.
Note that monsters with DROP_GOOD are much more likely to carry ego items than other 
monsters, and weapons or armour generated by a DROP_GREAT monster will always at least be an 
ego item, if there is a corresponding match for that weapon or armour tval and sval in this file.
The player can determine an object is an ego item in a number of ways: examples include sensing 
that it is an excellent, superb, ego item or high ego item, or using Rune Magic to determine the 
number of runes on a weapon or armour. Superb and high ego items are distinguished from 
excellent and regular ego items, by having a random extra flag as specified in the corresponding 
ego_item.txt entry. This means that in addition to the flags specified here, that the ego item has a 
randomly chosen flag from a possible list in tables.c, corresponding to the value of xtra.
There is a tier below egos for many items, including weapons, armour and lights, called magic 
items. Magic items are normal items which have the random extra flag only, and no ego abilities. 
Magic items will sense as excellent items, and appear to be mini-ego items. But they do not have a 
corresponding entry in the ego_item.txt file, and will be generated based on object boost code to 
ensure that they reach the mandated object power level for the particular level (see object2.c for 
details). Magic items are used to try to ensure that all weapon, armour and light drops are useful 
for the current level.
Some magic items will be generated as racial ego items. These are intermediate again between 
magic items and ego items. These are distinguished by having an xtra flag of 16. Racial ego items 
are part of an unfinished racial drop system. They have the random flag of a magic item but the 
negative racial flag they have allows the item to boost its power beyond what is normally 
permitted on the dungeon level. The racial drop system is intended to have e.g. orcs drop orcish 
weapons, armour and ego items, but causes too much of an impact on what equipment is found in 
the dungeon at this stage.
General notes
The ego-item indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed. (This is probably no 
longer correct).
Ego-items 1-63 are "armor", and 64-127 are "weapons" for historical reasons, but no other 
requirement.
Note that every "ego-item" type has a different "index", and can only be created from items that 
belong to a certain "slot" in the equipment, if one assumes that "ammo" belongs to an imaginary 
slot (23). (Note that the above is not true and was not true even before my patch. The 'slot' seems 
very useless to me right now. -MWK-)
Note that several "ego-item" types may share the same "textual name", such as with "Armor of 
Resistance" and "Shield of Resistance". (This may no longer be true, although duplicate names are 
permitted).
Ego_Item.txt entry format
N: serial number : ego type
X: inventory slot : rating : xtra
C: max to-hit : max to-dam : max to-ac : pval
W: depth : rarity : weight : cost
T: tval : min_sval : max_sval
F: flag | flag | etc
Y:rune type : rune count
A: activation : recharge time : recharge time dice
Understanding Ego_Item.txt
'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must increase for each new item.
'X' is for extra information - inventory slot and rating. Slots range from 23 (for ammunition) to 35 
(for boots). Rating affects level feelings.  The xtra value determines random extra flags for the ego-
item.  Nothing happens with a value of 0, 1 stands for "one random extra sustain", 2 is "one 
random extra resist", and 3 is "one random extra ability". For a full list of xtra abilities, see tables.c.
'C' is for creation bonuses - maximum to-hit, to-dam, to-ac, and pval. Cursed ego-items will negate 
the given value.
'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is normally found at, rarity determines 
how common the object is, weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the items value.
'F' is for flags. These are common to the object.txt, artifact.txt and ego_item.txt files. As many F: 
lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.
‘O’ is for Obvious flags. These are flags that are learned when the ego item is ‘named’ e.g. when 
the IDENT_NAME flag is applied. The Obvious flags should be obvious from the ego item name, 
and be a subset of the ‘F’ flags. As many O: lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags 
and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.
'T' is for possible 'tval' and 'sval' values of the base-item. Up to three 'T' entries are possible for a 
single object. The ego-item can only be generated from items of this tval, with sval in the specified 
range.
‘Y’ is for runes. When count number of type of runes are applied to an object, that is permitted to 
appear as an ego item of the corresponding type, then the object will be converted to this ego 
item. Objects and ego items which already have a count listed for the number of runes, are treated 
as having that many runes already, when a rune of the same type is applied. This allows runes in 
particular to be used to upgrade e.g. a weapon of Frost to a ‘Frostbite’ using two runes of Frost. 
Note that post conversion, the runes are stripped off, so that the additional rune abilities specified 
in rune.txt do not apply until a further rune is added again. Ego items will identify as having so 
many runes of a particular type as listed here even if they do not ‘internally’ have the runes 
applied.
'A' is for activation.  Activation is the effect the ego item activates for, referring to an entry number 
in spell.txt. The recharge time calculates from the recharge time plus a random value between 1 
and the recharge time dice (if not 0). If an activation is given then the ego item must also have the 
ACTIVATE or UNCONTROLLED flag. Ego item weapons with activations can also be inscribed with =A 
by the player which will mean that the activation is used against the monster that the ego item hits, 
provided the activation has recharged.
Customising this file
There are probably already too many ego items, particularly weapons, in Unangband, particularly 
with the addition of magic items. Care should be taken when adding additional ego types, that the 
ego type does not match or exceed the power of an equivalent artifact. Note that many top end 
ego items, particularly weapons, do this already. Consider restricting an ego type to a particular 
subset of armour or equipment that make it less useful.
Note that due to the way ego items are created, that ego item dragon armour is highly likely, and 
therefore no ego items for dragon armour should be created.

Monster.txt defines the list of monster races in the game. Each monster is of a particular monster 
race, which determines the powers and abilities it has and can use. The monster races are 
therefore central to the game design, and careful selection of powers and abilities for these races 
results in interesting game play.
Uniques are an instance of a monster race that has only one member. Once killed, a unique will not 
reappear in the game.
Monster.txt entry format

W: depth : rarity : group index : experience for kill
M: innate frequency : spell frequency : spell power : mana
B: attack method : attack effect : damage
S: spell type | spell type | etc
F: flag | flag | etc
D: Description
Understanding Monster.txt entries
'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must increase for each new item. Entry 0 
is used for the player.
'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are currently 16 colors, as follows:
D - Dark Gray	w – White	s – Gray		o - Orange
r – Red		g – Green	b – Blue		u - Brown
d – Black	W - Light Gray	v – Violet	y - Yellow
R - Light Red	G - Light Green	B - Light Blue	U - Light Brown
Note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and thus the monster will appear to 
be an empty black space if its color is "d".
'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet, armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal 
speed. Alertness ranges from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore intruders).
'W' is for more information - level, rarity, group index and experience for killing.  The group index is 
index to associate monsters of a particular type together. Monsters with the same group index will 
often be generated on the same level together.  Group indexes if defined will also be used for 
escorts and for the summon group summoning spell.  The current group indexes in use are:
1  Apprentices
10 Mimic
11 - 19 Elementals
20 Golem
21 Ghost
22 Spirit
23 Golem
24 Faerie
25 Ant
26 Termite

'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage from attack. There may be up to 
four of these lines; effect and damage are optional. See blows.txt for a definition of blow 
methods, and defines.h for a definition of blow effects, which are preceded by GF_ in this file.
'M' is for magic information - cast innate, cast spell, spell power, and mana.  All breath weapons 
and a few other spells are 'innate' and use the innate percentage chance to determine how 
frequently they are cast. In addition, some blow types may be used at range (such as arrow, lash, 
spit and so on) and also use the cast innate to determine how frequently they may be used.
All other spells use the cast spell percentage chance to determine their frequency. In addition, the 
spell power determines the damage multiplier for these spells (but not breath weapons, which 
depend on hit points).
Monster mana determines how many spells may be cast before having to rest to recover mana, or 
cast a spell to add mana. Each monster spell has a mana cost that is associated with this.
'S' is for spells. These are explained in more detail below. As many S: lines may be used as are 
needed to specify all the spells, spells
are separated by the '|' symbol.
'F' is for flags. These are explained in more detail below. As many F: lines may be used as are 
needed to specify all the flags, flags are separated by the '|' symbol.
'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed to describe the monster.
Understanding Monster Spells and Flags
To understand the additional monster flags, and spells, which are treated internally as flags, you 
should grep the code base using the regular expression RF[0-9]_ followed by the monster flag as 
shown in the monster.txt file.
Brief explanations of a number of flags follow:
UNIQUE monsters are just "special" monster races, with the requirement that only one monster of 
that race can exist at a time, and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.
ATTR_CLEAR monsters appear the same color as the floor, terrain feature or object underneath 
them.
ATTR_MULTI monsters are "multi-hued" - they change color, every player turn.
ATTR_METAL monsters have a occasionally "flickering" attr which is one step lighter than their base 
color.
CHAR_CLEAR monsters are totally invisible: the symbol shown on the screen is the same as the 
floor (or other terrain feature) below it, or the item that is lying on that floor. These monsters can 
currently be targetted as normal monsters: perhaps this can be changed so that the player must 
KNOW the monster is there (by bumping into it, or having the monster wake up and attack the 
player?)
CHAR_MULTI monsters are those which look like objects, and use the symbols of objects. They are 
in plain sight, but the character should not know that a monster is there. At the moment, such 
monsters can be targetted normally (which means that this flag currently has no effect), but this 
may change in the future, as with CHAR_CLEAR monsters.
(Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated as normal 
monsters that are just a little hard to see... if you "l"ook for them, you will find them unless they 
are invisible and you cannot see invisible, and if you use the * command for targetting mode you 
can pick them as a target.)
Object.txt
Object.txt entry format
N: serial number : & object name~
G: symbol : color
I: tval : sval : pval
W: depth : charges : weight : cost
P: base armor class : base damage : plus to-hit : plus to-dam : plus to-ac
A: depth/rarity : depth/rarity : etc
F: flag | flag | etc
Y: rune type | rune count
Understanding object.txt entries
'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must increase for each new item. The '&' 
and '~' symbols are use to include articles and pluralization as necessary to ensure grammatical  
correctness in object descriptions. See object2.c for the full parsing rules for these strings.
'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are currently 16 colors, as follows:
D - Dark Gray	w – White	s – Gray		o - Orange
r – Red		g – Green	b – Blue		u - Brown
d – Black	W - Light Gray	v – Violet	y - Yellow
R - Light Red	G - Light Green	B - Light Blue	U - Light Brown
Note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and means the object will not be 
seen. There are also a large number of flavored objects whose actual appearance is defined in 
flavor.txt and who take an additional prefix or suffix on the name.
'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the sval identifies the subtype and the 
pval indicates the amount of effect the item has, if applicable. 
'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is normally found at, rarity determines 
how commoAn the object is, weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the items value.
'P' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam 
and to-ac.
'A' is for allocation - depth and rarity, in pairs. This allows an item to have multiple natural depths 
and rarities. It is used to ensure that certain vital items such as food and identify scrolls are found 
throughout the dungeon.
'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F: lines may be used as are needed to 
specify all the flags and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.

Understanding p_class.txt entries
'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must increase for each new class.
'S' is for the stat modifiers - strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma, agility, 
size.
'C' is for the base skills - disarming, magic devices, saving throws, stealth, searching ability, digging, 
to hit (throws), to hit (normal), to hit (bows).
'X' is for the skill modifiers - disarming, magic devices, saving throws, stealth, searching ability, 
digging, to hit (throws), to hit (normal), to hit (bows).  The modifiers are added to the base skill 
every ten levels.
'I' is for extra info - experience factor in percent, base chance for pseudo-id (smaller is better), 
level dependent divisor for the pseudo-id chance, type of sensing (see object2.c), sense squared.

'A' is for attack info - maximum possible number of attacks, minimum weapon weight for 
calculating the number of attacks, multiplier for attack calculations, weight divisor for charging.
'M' is for magic info - tval of the used spellbook, number of the spell-stat, level of the first spell, 
weight that hurts spells.
'T' is for class titles (Up to 10 entries).
'E' is for starting equipment - tval of the item, sval of the item, minimum amount, maximum 
amount.
'F' is for class flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F: lines may be used as are needed to 
specify all the flags and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.
P_Race.txt
Overview
This file is also used to define possible shapes that a player can shape change into as an effect, in 
addition to their starting race. To define that a race is selectable as a starting race, it must have an 
index less than the number of 'playable' races defined in the limits.txt file.

Understanding p_race.txt entries
'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must increase for each new race.
'S' is for the stat modifiers - strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, charisma, agility, 
size.
'R' is for the base skills - disarming, magic devices, saving throws, stealth, searching ability, digging, 
to hit (throws), to hit (melee), to hit (bows).
'X' is for extra info - experience factor in percent, range of infra-vision in 10 feet increments.
'I' is for info - starting point of the player history, base age, random age modifier, home town.
'H' is height info - base height (males), mod height (males), base height (females), mod height 
(females).
'W' is weight info - base weight (males), base weight (females).
'F' is for racial flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F: lines may be used as are needed 
to specify all the flags and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.
'C' is for class choices. This defines a | separated list of classes that can be chosen for this race with 
the birth_intermediate option. These will be greyed out, but still selectable with the birth_advance 
option. Each number refers to the index of the class in p_class.txt.
'O' is for objects. This defines if the class has a built in object in a particular equipment slot. The 
value refers to the index of the object in object.txt.
Spell.txt
Spell.txt entry format
N: number : name

C: class : level : mana : failure : min failure
F: flags
B: attack method : attack effect : damage
L: duration
S: other effect : parameter
D: description
Understanding Spell.txt entries
'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must increase for each new item.
'A' is indicates which objects the spell appears in, referenced by object tval and sval – see 
object.txt for details. Slot should be unique for objects which have multiple spells associated with 
them, and slots must be numbered from 1 upwards. However slots are renumbered as a part of 
reading this file in, and usually just leaving slot set to 1 will result in the correct in-game behaviour.
The exception is rune stones, where the slot corresponds to the second ('verb') rune stone sval. 
This allows spells to be cast from rune stones by combining a ‘noun’ and a ‘verb’ rune stone. This is 
done implicitly when multiple rune stones are carried by the player.
'C' indicates the casting details listed by class. Note that currently no more than 8 classes can cast a 
particular spell, as defined in defines.h.
'F' flags indicating some of the effects that take place when the spell is cast. These are fairly self-
explanatory. As many F: lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags are 
separated by the '|' symbol.
'B' - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage from attack. There may be up to four of these 
lines; effect and damage are optional. See blows.txt for a definition of blow methods, and 
defines.h for a definition of blow effects, which are preceded by GF_ in this file.
The blow damage can here be specified in a format 1d2+3+(4d5+6)/7 to indicate that the base 
damage is 1d2+3 and 4d5+6 damage is added to this every 7 levels. Various shorter permutations 
of this format are permitted, and the brackets are only required to disambiguate 1d2+3/4 from 
(1d2+3)/4.
'L' indicates how long the duration component of the spell lasts.
'S' indicates another spell effect, determined by the numeric parameter. The parameter value 
depends on the effect in question. See spells2.c for details.
'D' description indicates the description display when the spell takes effect. If an item has a 
description, it will be identified as a part of the activation of the item.
Customising this file
Note that if you are applying blows to a player, you should apply the blow that blinds them last, if 
possible, because they will not know the results of the other blows.
