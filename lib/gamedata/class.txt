# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new class.

# 'stats' is for the stat modifiers - strength, intelligence, wisdom,
# dexterity, constitution.

# 'skill-<skill name>' is for skills - physical and magical disarming,
# magic devices, saving throws, stealth, to hit (normal), to hit (bows),
# to hit (throwing), digging.  The base entry is what gets added to the
# character's skills at birth, the increments are added to the base skill
# every ten levels.

# 'hitdie' is for additional average hitpoints gained at maximum level.

# 'exp' is for percent of "standard" experience needed to gain a level.

# 'info' is for extra info - max. hitpoints gained per level, experience
# factor in percent.

# 'attack' is for attack info - maximum possible number of attacks, minimum
# weapon weight for calculating the number of attacks, multiplier for
# attack calculations.

# 'equip' is for starting equipment - tval of the item, sval of the item,
# minimum amount, maximum amount.

# 'flags' is for class flags.

# 'title' is for class titles.
# There can be any number of them - max 12 chars if possible (13 would mean
# overlapping the blank space on the char sheet and mani display, more won't
# be seen.)

# 'magic' is for general magic info - level of the first spell, weight that
# hurts spells, number of books used.

# 'book' names the following techniques as being part of a book. This is
# not an actual object, just a way of classifying techniques.

# 'spell' defines an individual spell - name, level, mana required,
# fail-rate, experience for first casting.    'spell:' lines always refer to
# spells in the previous 'book:' line.  The lines below are all used in
# reference to the previous 'spell:' line.

# 'effect' defines the spell effect (as listed in src/list-effects.h),
# and optionally parameters for effect subtype, effect radius and
# an extra parameter for various things

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.

# 'seffect-msg' provides a message which can be used in whatever way the effect
# needs, typically to print during the effect, or as a death message.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the spell. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.

cdesc:You are a Space Marine. You are well trained in most forms of combat, being especially good with long guns, but your biggest advantage comes from the Marines' support: after getting a promotion and returning to field HQ you will be equipped appropriately.

cdesc:A civilian weapon expert, reasonably skilled with all ranged weapons and the best of any role with your chosen specialty. Being used to firing at paper targets which rarely fire back though, your melee combat and stealth are not so hot. You'll start being able to recognize all weapon mods.

cdesc:You are well equipped, for the beach. You are in fact rather out of your depth here - this is definitely going to be a challenge. But you do have some advantages - a universal map, a winning smile, some spending money and (due to being the least experienced role) the best experience and talent gain rates.

sdesc:When next to a rock face, climb up it to the level above. 
sdesc:Failing can hurt - Feather Falling is recommended.

cdesc:You are trained and equipped for underground exploration, can avoid falls and will gain powerful abilities to dig, climb, map, detect and find hidden passages. Your combat ability is middling - fitness helps but only so much without having practiced much. However you can become an effective tactical fighter through your positioning abilities.

cdesc:Jedi are famous for skill with a lightsaber - you'll excel with melee energy weapons and do well with other melee weapons. Eventually you'll even be able to construct your own. Ranged weapons are not you, but you'll be supported by a number of subtle powers as you advance. There are also Dark Jedi... who are powerful, yes, but at a cost!

#sdesc:Fires a magic missile that always hits its target and does
#sdesc: unresistable damage.
#sdesc:  Sometimes a beam is fired instead that hurts each monster
#sdesc: in its path.
#sdesc:  The chance to get a beam goes up with your character level.

cdesc:Devices are your strength - you'll know most on sight, and know how to get the best out of them too. While you aren't much of a fighter in general, you do know energy weapons (melee and ranged) and can see any machine or cyborg's weak points. You also excel with printers and item related cards, and will gain a few skills to use items in unexpected ways.
