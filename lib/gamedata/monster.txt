# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry.

# 'plural' is for plurals to monster names that can't be handled by normal
# pluralisation rules (see mon-desc.c for more detail).

# 'base' is for the monster base template (see monster_base.txt). This
# provides the default display symbol, some default flags, and the monster's
# pain messages.

# 'glyph' is for the display symbol. If present, this overrides the default
# display symbol from the base template.

# 'color' is for color. There are 28 colors, as follows:
# d - 0  - Black
# w - 1  - White
# s - 2  - Slate
# o - 3  - Orange
# r - 4  - Red
# g - 5  - Green
# b - 6  - Blue
# u - 7  - Umber
# D - 8  - Light Dark
# W - 9  - Light Slate
# P - 10 - Light Purple
# y - 11 - Yellow
# R - 12 - Light Red
# G - 13 - Light Green
# B - 14 - Light Blue
# U - 15 - Light Umber
# p - 16 - Purple
# v - 17 - Violet
# t - 18 - Teal
# m - 19 - Mud
# Y - 20 - Light Yellow
# i - 21 - Magenta-Pink
# T - 22 - Light Teal
# V - 23 - Light Violet
# I - 24 - Light Pink
# M - 25 - Mustard
# z - 26 - Blue Slate
# Z - 27 - Deep Light Blue

# (note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and thus the
# monster will appear to be an empty black space if its color is "d".)

# Note to maintainers/devteam: Light Violet (V) is currently used for the
# "purple uniques" option. The option makes all uniques appear in this colour
# (instead of only Castamir and Waldern). It is therefore unwise to use it 
# for non-unique monsters.

# 'speed' is for speed; 110 is normal speed.

# 'hit-points' is the average number of hitpoints for this monster race, or the
# exact number for unique monsters.

# 'hearing' is at what multiple of the player's vision radius the monster
# notices the player.

# 'armor-class' is a measure of how likely the player is to hit the monster;
# the player's hit chance is rolled against 2/3 of this value.

# 'sleepiness' is for initial monster sleep value. Sleepiness ranges from 0
# (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore intruders).

# 'depth' is the monster's usual dungeon level

# 'rarity' is used for picking monsters to be generated; probability of a given
# monster race is 100/rarity

# 'weight' is the monster's corpse weight.

# 'experience' is the base experience for the monster; this is multiplied by
# the monster depth and divided by the player level to get the number of
# experience points the player receives for killing the monster.

# 'blow' is for blows -- method of attack, effect of attack, and damage from
# attack.
# There may be up to four of these lines; effect and damage are optional.

# 'flags' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many flags:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags are
# separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'flags-off' is for flags to remove from the template. For example, in
# monster_base.txt, molds are given HURT_FIRE. We don't want the red mold
# to have that, so we add a 'flags-off:HURT_FIRE' line to substract that flag.

# 'spell-freq' is for spell frequency - the number of monster turns, on 
# average, before the monster will cast one of its spells. This must not be
# zero. If it is 1, the monster will never move while the player
# is in sight, and will thus never attack in melee, as it will cast spells
# every turn: if the monster is to use a melee attack, then X must be 2 or
# greater.

# 'spell-power' is for the relative casting strength of a spellcasting monster.
# The default value is the same as the monster's depth, so a monster with
# spell power greater than their depth is a particularly strong caster.

# 'spells' is for spell flags, which work just like regular flags.

# 'drop' lines create possible drops for specific monsters. If any L lines are
# present, the monster will drop *only* items from its L lines. Each item has
# its percent chance rolled for individually.

# 'friends' lines specify options for what monsters can appear with other
# monsters on creation. Note that number is throttled depending on the dungeon
# level with only half appearing at depth and the full complement 5 levels
# deeper. All town friends will be divided by two.
# The code places monsters from bottom up and will not place it if it can't find
# room. For best results, places the most important friends at the bottom.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed to
# describe the monster. Leading whitespace will be removed, and a single space
# will be added between desc: lines.

# 'mimic' lines give item types that this monster may mimic. Each of the objects
# has an equal chance of being mimicked.

# 'force-location' restricts the creation of that monster race to a specific
# location (town, dungeon or special coordinates). Mainly used for FORCE_DEPTH
# uniques to tag them as "dungeon boss".

# === Understanding monster.txt flags ===

# UNIQUE monsters are just "special" monster races, with the requirement that
# only one monster of that race can exist at a time, and when it is killed, it
# can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters appear the same color as the floor, terrain feature or
# object underneath them.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters are multi-hued -- they change color, every player turn.
# Their base color is only used to set the initial color when they spawn.

# ATTR_FLICKER monsters are also multi-hued -- but they only change between a
# small range of colors related to their defined color, and they start out
# as their defined color.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters are totally invisible: the symbol shown on the screen is
# the same as the floor (or other terrain feature) below it, or the item that
# is lying on that floor.

# TODO: Explain the other monster and spell flags. But maybe in another file.
