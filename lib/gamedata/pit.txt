# Each entry must start with a 'name' line, with a name.
#
# 'room' is for room type. Currently, room type is one of the following:
#   (1) Pits (large room filled with many monsters of a few types in an
#       ordered fashion)
#   (2) Nests (large room filled with many types of monsters in a
#       disordered fashion)
#   (3) Other (all monster groupings can be used to fill other areas with
#       thematically chosen monsters; entries with all room types can be
#       used for this, so type 3 allows grouping which don't appear in
#       pits or nests)
#
# 'alloc' is for rarity and average level. A rarity of N means that the pit is
# N times more rare than a pit with a rarity of 1. The average level is the
# dungeon level at which this pit is most common.
#
# 'obj-rarity' is for object rarity. A rarity of N means that every square of
# the pit has an N % chance of having an item.
#
# 'color' is for monster color. If any 'color' lines are present, then all
# monsters in this pit will be one of the specified colors.
# As many 'color' lines as are necessary may be used.
#
# 'mon-base' is for monster template (see monster_base.txt). Up to 4
# 'mon-base' lines may be  present. If there are no 'mon-base' lines,
# then monsters may have any monster template. Otherwise, every monster in
# this pit/nest will be one of the listed templates.
#
# 'flags-req' is for monster flags. Every monster in this pit/nest will have
# every listed flag.
# As many 'flags-req' lines as are necessary may be used.
#
# 'flags-ban' is for forbidden flags. No monster in this nest/pit will have
# any of the listed flags.
# As many 'flags-ban' lines as are necessary may be used.
#
# 'spell-freq' is for frequency of spells. Every monster in this
# nest/pit will have this frequency or lower.
#
# 'spell-req' is for spell flags. Every monster in this nest/pit will have
# every listed spell flag.
# As many 'spell-req' lines as are necessary may be used.
#
# 'spell-ban' is for forbidden spell flags. No monster in this nest/pit will
# have any of the listed spell flags.
# As many 'spell-ban' lines as are necessary may be used.
#
# 'mon-ban' is for forbidden monsters. The named monster will not appear in
# this pit.
# As many 'mon-ban' lines as are necessary may be used.
