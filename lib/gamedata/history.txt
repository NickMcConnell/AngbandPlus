# File: history.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "player history" information for 
# the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Background information:
# Pieces of player backstory are chosen from "charts", which are lists of
# phrases or sentences with similar general meaning.

# 'chart' lines give the number of the current chart, the number of the chart
# that will be used next (or 0 if the last chart), and a cutoff for choosing
# the current line.  If the first field in two chart lines is the same, the
# second should be as well, to maintain consistent choices and end up with
# something readable.

# 'phrase' lines are the actual chart entries which make up the history.

# Chart progression by race:
#   Human         -->  1 -->  2 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   Half-Elf      -->  4 -->  1 -->  2 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   Elf           -->  5 -->  6 -->  9 --> 54 --> 55 --> 56
#   High-Elf      -->  7 -->  8 -->  9 --> 54 --> 55 --> 56
#   Hobbit        --> 10 --> 11 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   Gnome         --> 13 --> 14 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   Dwarf         --> 16 --> 17 --> 18 --> 57 --> 58 --> 59 --> 60 --> 61
#   Half-Orc      --> 19 --> 20 -->  2 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   Android       28 .. 36
#   Time-Lord     37 .. 40
#   Kobold        --> 23 --> 24 --> 25 --> 26 --> 67 --> 68 --> 69

# This table *must* be correct or the history may look very silly.

# Note that the "spacing" in the "description" lines is very important!
