# Some fields accept randomized numbers of the form "10+2d3M4" where
# 10 is the non-variable base, 2d3 is a standard die roll, and
# M4 uses the m_bonus function to generate a number between 0 and
# 4 according to a normal distribution.  All three components are
# optional, and the number of dice is optional and assumed to be 1
# when not specified.  10+2d3M4 has the range 12-20.  10+M4 has the
# range 10-14.  10+2d3 has the range 12-16.  10+d3 has the range 11-13.
# 2d3, d3, M4, 2d3M4, and d3M4 are all acceptable as well.  Randomized
# expressions which begin with "-" are currently handled differently in the
# "values" line than they are elsewhere.  In the "values" line, the leading
# "-" sets the sign on the base value (i.e. 10 in the example).  On other lines,
# a leading "-" in the randomized expression means multiply the random result
# from what follows by negative one.  As a result, something like "-d4" will
# not work as you want when used for a "values" line.  Use "-5+1d4" instead.

# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The '&' and '~' symbols are use to
# include articles and pluralization as necessary to ensure
# grammatical correctness in object descriptions.
#
# For non-English and irregular plurals, the '|' symbol may be used
# instead, as in "|singular|plural|". The part between the first and
# second | symbol is used for singular, and the part between the second
# and third | for plural.  The number of | symbols in the name must
# always be a multiple of 3.

# 'graphics' is for symbol and color. There are 27 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Umber
# W - Light Gray   P - Light Purple   y - Yellow        R - Light Red
# G - Light Green  B - Light Blue     U - Light Umber   p - Purple
# v - Violet       t - Teal           m - Mud           Y - Light Yellow
# i - Magenta-Pink T - Light Teal     V - Light Violet  I - Light Pink
# M - Mustard      z - Blue Slate     Z - Deep Light Blue

# Another color, "d", is used for "flavoured" items.

# 'type' is for the base type of item, from object_base.txt.

# 'level' defines how "advanced" the object is, when determining how easy it
# is to use a device, gun or gadget.

# 'weight' is in tenth-pounds, grams or kg (if a g or kg suffix is used).

# 'cost' is the item's base value.

# 'attack' is for combat attack information, the item's base damage and
# pluses to-hit and to-dam.  The base damage should be a standard dice roll
# (eg 2d5), and last two numbers can be any randomized values as above.

# 'armor' is for armor information, the item's base armor class and plus to-ac.
# The latter accepts randomized values.

# 'alloc' is for allocation - frequency and range of levels found. It is used to
# ensure that certain vital items such as food and recall cards
# are found throughout the dungeon. The "allocation" depth need not
# match the level as specified in the "level:" line, but is likely similar.

# 'charges' is for charges (wands and devices only).  This field accepts
# randomized values.

# 'pile' is for piling behaviour - how likely the item is to be found in a
# pile, and how many (random value) objects in such a pile.  Objects
# without a pile line appear singly.

# 'flags' is for flags, which can be either object flags (as found in
# src/list-object-flags.h) or kind flags (src/list-kind-flags.h).  As many
# flags: lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags, and
# flags are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'carried-flags' is for (object) flags, which take effect when carried
# (and *not* when worn)

# 'values' is for object modifiers which take a value - stats, slays, brands,
# resistances and so on.  An example is SLAY_UNDEAD[3], which denotes that
# the weapon concerned has a basic 3x slay against undead creatures.  Like
# flags, values are separated by '|' and as many values: lines as needed
# can be used.

# 'power' is used in calculating the power of the object for pricing and 
# generating random artifacts.  It reflects the power of the effect of the
# object; other properties are taken into account separately in power
# calculation.

# 'msg' is any message printed on using the object.

# 'effect' is for the effect when an object is eaten, activated or whatever.
# Fields are the name of the effect (as found in src/list-effects.h), the
# subtype which is either an index or a name (look at effect_subtype()
# in src/effects.c for more information about the available subtypes), the
# radius, and the other parameter.  The effect name is required.  The others
# are optional, and the trailing ones that are unused can be omitted.

# 'effect-yx' is y and x values for an effect if necessary

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.

# 'time' gives a random value to be used as the time to recharge for a rod or
# activatable item.

# 'pval' is for pval - an auxiliary value that can mean food value, launcher
# multiplier or turns of light. A pval can take a random value.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the object. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.

##### Thrown Weapons #####

# Thrown weapons - molotov, fr[ao]g grenade, EMP grenade, thermal detonator, energy bomb, flash grenade, smoke bomb, vortex bomb, gas grenade, plasmacon, sonic stun[ner]...
# If thrown these are assumed armed, most should be launchable to greater distance (and contact fused?) with a grenade launcher.
# How much of this should be base and how much ego?
# The different names (and weights, radii etc) suggest that all the above (and other) type be different base items,
# with egos mostly being applicable to all of them.
# You can arm them without throwing and get faster - or arm them and get caught.
# This group includes some heavy weapons (satchel charge) that aren't really meant for throwing, although a strong character could throw them a small distance.
# There may be some (thermal detonator) that are somewhere in between.
# Egos may include: crawler (will move after being thrown towards closest target, including you), contact, 'persist' (remains in place until touched)
# Preferably thrown items should rebound.
# Combat information here is for typical damage at ground zero - damage is much less at range.
# Even small explosions should cause secondaries and especially fling stuff around which goes off when it hits the wall/monster.

################ forcefield generators (belt armor)
## These are worn on the belt and you can only have one at once - including force-type
## armors worn in other slots, although not including normal force enhancement.
## These can be of different strengths but probably can't be enhanced in the same way,
## and while there will be egos ("mods") most of them are specific to genneys.
## As this means there is less progression, and as there a lot of base types, they are
## fairly rare.

##### Containers ######
##
## 'What's interesting about a container?'
## - The contents. At least some containers should have 'themed' contents - items with a common purpose, or perhaps material, etc.
## - Difficulty of getting into it. May be locked, sealed, trapped, etc. May be able to break into it, possibly damaging the contents.
## - As all containers can take infinite bulk and high weight, avoid anything which sounds flimsy (paper bags, cardboard boxes).
