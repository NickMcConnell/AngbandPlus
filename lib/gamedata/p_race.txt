ext:None
desc:A typical member of your race with nothing added or taken away - not a mutant, cyborg or other exotic variation.
 
ext:Mutant
stats:-1:-1:0:-1:-1:-3:0
hitdie:-15
exp:10
player-flags:REROLL_MUTATIONS
desc:You will begin with one or more mutations - which although they may have disadvantages are not purely negative. You'll gain at least one more mutation as you advance, and you'll gain the ability to exchange unwanted mutations for one that may be preferable - and eventually, to withstand radiation innately.

ext:Cyborg
talents:-3:0
exp:60:0
desc:You will begin with one or more cybernetic implants. These are varied and generally powerful, but having become used to your new abilities you have had less time for learning other things. So you have less talents available, and more experience is needed to advance - especially early on.

weightmod:350
desc:The race with average abilities, from a human perspective at least. While you won't have bulletproof skin or [bla], there's a reason that is has primarily been humans who have colonized the galaxy - in a word, adaptability. That shows in the lowest experience requirement and the most specialization through talents.

values:RES_ELEC[-1]
desc:Sentient robots have been constructed for a variety of purposes and while artificial intelligence still isn't as good as the real thing, they have many advantages: a tough, fast metal body, precise aiming, rapid regeneration and IR vision. However, you can't easily gain talents, can't eat normal food and must avoid electric shocks.

obj-flags:SUST_CON | REGEN
desc:Time Lords take a human form, which changes when they regenerate. They can regenerate as many as 12 times, but it is always chancy - especially for the less experienced, and experience is not so easily gained (they have seen it all before). But spacetime is yours to command, with more tricks available as you advance, and that's the way to avoid needing to take that chance.

# spell:name:level:fail:exp:stat:hp:cooldown
spell:Force Regeneration:25:22:40:2:2d4:1
seffect:FORCE_REGEN
sdesc:Forces your body into regeneration by an effort of will. This is just as chancy as regeneration at death is, though and failure means losing a regeneration as well as some brief but nasty side-effects.
