### Understanding chest.txt ###

# When a chest is opened, a % is rolled and compared to all themes' "from" for
# that chest's name. If it matches, that theme is selected - if none do then the
# 'good' theme (random good items) is used?

# The theme then generates random items from the list of tval or items (if these
# do not sum to 100, the reset are random items). Containers can never be produced,
# or anything too heavy, or more than a limited number.


# name: name (of a theme)
# switch:<chance>:	Chance of this theme causing a switch to another theme rather than another item from this one
# item:<chance>:<tval OR object name>: chance / 100, possible tval for this theme
# from:<chance>:<container name>:	This container has this % chance of generating this theme.
# rarity:<multiplier> Decreasae the change by this factor of being generated
# level:<level>	Compared to the level it was genrated at, increase or reduce generation
# maxlevel:<level> Never generate below this
# minlevel:<level> or above this

# Cash, etc. Gold block? Anything over a value-by-level?
