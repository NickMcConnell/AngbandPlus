# quest.txt

# This file contains the fixed (and only) quests.  The current system is that
# a copy of these is made into the player data at birth, and the level field
# in that copy is zeroed when the quest is completed.  This system could be
# improved; it could also be easily adapted to add more fixed quests (by adding
# to this file).  It would also only require fairly small game code changes to
# allow other quests to be added as a result of game events.

name:Rats
level:6
race:giant grey rat
number:12
store:Volcano:General Store
entrymin:2
entrymax:5
entryfeature:permanent wall
intro:There's a cellar out back. It's full of rats. Are you up for cleaning them out?
desc:Deal with the rats in the cellar
succeed:So you've cleaned them out? Great. Maybe some day Nijel - who is not exactly a little kid any more after all - will learn to muck out his own pets. But as you clearly care about animals I hope you will appreciate some rat treats along with the $200 cash.
failure:So you were defeated by a mouse? How heroic! Brave Sir Robin would be proud.

#12 generated - more rewards if you return more than 6
min-found:6
max-remaining:0
intro:Well, I guess I can trust you now. I thought I was being clever, using a small cave that I thought nobody knew about to store my stash of valuable rare spirits safely. It's by the volcanic vent. Unfortunately the roof collapsed - I really didn't expect that! Could you dig your way in and retrieve it for me? You'll be rewarded, and not just with a few bottle caps this time. I would take digging equipment of some kind - I don't know how far back the collapse went.
desc:Retrieve the rare booze from the volcanic cave
succeed:Thanks a lot. As promised I have $200 per bottle for you.
failure:It was all lost? That's a shame.
flags:locked

#succeed:Well done. A reward? Isn't the thrill of exploration its own reward? No? Well, OK.

name:Msing Pills
level:15
object:pill
store:Fortress:Pharmacy
entrymin:20
# You must pick up every pill you can see (max-remaining 0) and return a reasonable number (of the ~200) but if there is some accidental destruction that's OK.
min-found:120
max-remaining:0
intro:Most of my stock has been stolen. I don't know who did it, or where they have been taken - I couldn't get a straight answer from the witness. He just babbled on about a glowing maze filled with ghosts - he must have popped a few pills himself! But you will be well rewarded if you can bring it all back.
desc:Find the pills and return them to the pharmacy
succeed:Well done - you are going to like these, I'm sure.
failure:Oh well - I realise that I didn't give you much to go on.

intro:My baking is famous across dozens of vaults, and it's all down to my secret recipe. Nobody's managed to reproduce it, and believe me they have tried! But those snakes at the Black Market don't want to even attempt that - instead their agent deceived my young assistant, switching our one master copy of the recipe with junk. The agent slipped away underground, and is probably some way down by now. If you could get the recipe back for me before she breaks cover and takes it to the Black Market, I would be very grateful!
desc:Find the Black Market's agent, return the recipe
succeed:Here's the last batch and - if you can keep it quiet - the secret ingredients!
failure:So why did I trust you again?

name:Hunter, in Darkness
level:25
race:wumpus
number:1
entryfeature:granite wall
store:Soldier, Sailor, Chef, Pie:Black Market
intro:No, you aren't seeing the good stuff. That's not for everyone. Go kill something big to show us you aren't all talk. There's a wumpus in the bat cave. That would do nicely.
desc:Hunt the Wumpus
succeed:The traditional wumpus hunter's prize isn't worth much, but I think you'll like this boomstick!
failure:Well, I saw you walking boldly into the wumpus's den - so I will admit that although you didn't manage to defeat it, you aren't just a poseur. So I'll reluctantly allow you in to see more stuff, but you can't expect a real reward. You do still get the traditional wumpus hunter's prize, though, for what that's worth.
