Most files in this directory are use by the get_rnd_line function for various
purposes in the game. They can be edited and customized by the user with any
ascii text editor. If you add / remove lines you should modify the index (the
first line) accordingly. If you set an invalid index or remove the buffer line
weird messages and other things can appear, and you can crash the game. Please
see sample.txt before you try modifying the files.
The a_*.txt and w_*.txt are used when the game generates a random artifact.
However, instead of picking a name from the appropriate file, the game may
form a new name from syllables[].
