# This is the file for allowing uniques to speak their "own" lines.
# Deleting this file will have no real effect on the game.  Modifying it may
# cause STRANGE unique lines to come up if the format's wrong, but shouldn't
# crash anything.  The format goes like so:
# 
# N:<mon_race->id>
# says line 1
# says line 2
# says line 3
#
# Empty line is separater of blocks.
#
# A '*' in the number field is a wildcard and applies to any monster.
# It should only be placed at the end of the file, since all 'N:' lines
# after it will be ignored.
#
# Two or more monsters can share lines; just put their N: lines in a
# contiguous block.
