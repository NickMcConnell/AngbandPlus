# This is the file for allowing uniques to speak their "own" lines.
# Deleting this file will have no real effect on the game.  Modifying it may
# cause STRANGE unique lines to come up if the format's wrong, but shouldn't
# crash anything.  The format goes like so:
# 
# N:45:whoever this is
# 3
# says line 1
# says line 2
# says line 3
#
# The number after the N: is the "monster index number" obtained from
# r_info.txt.  The text field after that number isn't actually used--it's
# just there to help humans edit the file.  The numbers on lines by
# themselves are the number of lines that the monster has.  Getting these
# numbers wrong won't crash anything, but will produce strange lines.
#
# A '*' in the number field is a wildcard and applies to any monster.
# It should only be placed at the end of the file, since all 'N:' lines
# after it will be ignored.
#
# Two or more monsters can share lines; just put their N: lines in a
# contiguous block.
#
# To stop a certain monster from having unique lines, put a # in front of
# its N: line.
