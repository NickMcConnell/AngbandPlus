13-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.8g Bugfix release

- Fixed stores so that they should work in
campaign mode correctly now. We should still
ensure that you get great items as quest rewards,
currently, they are just generated as very deep
items.
- You can now specify what items a store sells
in u_info.txt and with what frequency these items
are chosen. Note that you must specify at least
15 items per store.
- Added more monsters.
- Made ogres also orcs, dragonflies also dragons
and dragon bats also dragons.
- Changed monster recall so that mixes of two
monster types are displayed e.g "mix of orc
and giant".
- Added insects and plants, which are hurt by
slay animal weapons, but not summoned by summon
animal spells.
- Add sense natural creatures flag to slay
animal weapons and 2 artifacts.
- Added 'correct' identification of when you
have an item that provides telepathy/sensing,
but this may cause a big slow down.

13-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.8f Bugfix release

- Fixed a problem where monsters would get stuck
inside unknown jammed doors.
- Removed some debugging code.
- Fixed bug where spear/ray of light and wall spells
would not correctly affect grid/items in grid.
- Fixed bug where stinking cloud would not do enough
damage.
- Fixed bug where detect magic/detect curse were
providing wrong information.
- Fixed bug where thorny bushes would injure you
while standing in them as well as moving through them.
- Fixed bugs where objects and monsters would be
placed in trees and rubble.
- Fixed bug preventing you crossing trees/rubble.
- Reorganised human monsters, so that 'p's are now
priests (including paladins), 'q's are now mages
(including rangers), 't's are now thieves and
warriors, and ensuring that all human monsters
and uniques are distinguished (Since there are so
many). Regularised 'h', 'l', 'o', 'O', and 'T'
monsters to match.

12-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.8e Bugfix release

- Removed apple tree and crab apple tree monsters,
and FORCE_MAXHP from troll priests.
- Added palantir back as a source of light. It
was causing too many problems with the randarts
code otherwise.
- Fixed crash bug due to incorrect tval in x_info.txt
for potion flavors.
- Made flavor code a lot safer so it'll report an
item as (unflavored) rather than crashing.
- Removed generation of chests in rooms (Was
debugging code).
- Fixed chests so cannot find a secret on a known
trapped chest.

12-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.8d Bugfix release

- Added x_info.txt flavor file, and code support.
Note: we could modify the code, so that multiple
flavors per item could be supported, and then
randomly determine which flavor the item actually
was. This would require a flavor field in object,
and any such item would not be easily known.
- Note we could think about flavoring other items
(Ego weapons/armor/etc.) if we stored flavor
with the object (Probably need to increase it to
s16b size).
- Monsters could be generated with 0 maximum
hp which would result in a crash when killing
them (Reported by Sean Lester).
- Changed power levels for invisibility,
telepathy and new esp flags. This will result
in new rand artifact sets for existing
characters.
- New drakes all had invisible flag by mistake.
- Now lites source monster if they attack
using fire/electricity etc. and does not
reveal hidden monsters this way.
- Made it so the palantir does not provide lite.
- Fixed a bug with wizard lites that was preventing
them providing lite.

07-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.8c Bugfix release

- Updated monster memory to include information
about auras, monster lites and sneaky monsters.
- Made powerful monsters have a radius 2 aura.
- Fixed descriptions for looking at features
(Hopefully I have got all exceptions).
- Implemented players and monsters getting stuck
in some kinds of terrain.  In particular,
you can get stuck in cages, by teleporting/
phase dooring around them. So always have
an alternative escape mechanism. Unless you 
want monsters throwing bananas at you...
- Room flags were never getting initialised
properly, resulting in room descriptions always
being visible.
- Changes to out of line of sight grids should
correctly obscure the grid now.
- Changed open chest colors to match broken
chests.
- All statues will be of uniques now.
- Fix bug preventing chests being opened.
- Fix bug where closing a chest then reopening
would create 'free items'.
- Fix bug with opening and relocking locked doors
eventually resulting in a store. Now also prevent
infinite experience from locking and unlocking them.
- Fixed bug where objects not detect with
object detection spell.
- Honor '=i' inscription in more places in code.
- Fixed chest traps. Still need some work to
support multiple trap chests properly.
- Fixed bug where you could teleport into deep
water/lava/acid etc. This was bad...

06-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.8b Bugfix release

- Tidied up fire/lava/plasma damage information
about grids and also provided for electricity.
You should now see (non-invisible) monsters as
well.
- Being in water now causes acid/fire damage to
be halved, and electricity/cold damage to double.
This may exceed limits for breath weapons, so
be careful. This also includes monsters. Slay
bonuses are modified down to 2 times or up to
4 times as appropriate. (Idea adapated from
Oangband).
- Renamed water hound to acid hound, and added
water hound with same stats but no acid
attacks.
- Beastmasters and mystics now summon animals.
Renamed the vanilla beastmaster to 'Summoner'.
- Gave thieves of all kinds the 'SNEAKY' flag,
which allows them to hide in various things
and behind large objects.
- Fixed area based spells (eg light area,
call light). These were incorrectly double
damage, but I have left this as it stands.
- Gave various monsters aura attacks, in
particular fire and ice elementals (Fire and
cold respectively), ring wraiths and balrogs.
Auras attack you like a terrain if you are
adjacent to a monster with the aura, or if you
attack the monster directly.
- Vortices now attack with their breath weapon
in many instances, since this is now possible.
Many of them have auras. They may also be found
in bottles.
- Added has lite to novice monsters, ethereal
and crystal monsters and light and sun monsters.
Note that HAS_AURA with a fire or electricity
attack is similar but not the same as HAS_LITE.
In particular, it does not light the floor around
the monster.
- Stumps and branches are now junk, and not
flavored by the monster they are cut from. Trees
also drop broken sticks.
- Fixed up problems with the spell book spell
order.
- Changed lighting code slightly to make
view_bright_light option work better in town.
- Removed last 2 non-Tolkein or non-mythological
uniques.

06-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.8a Bugfix release

- Fixed problem with not using variant_save_feats
option in town.
- Fixed bug causing monsters to get twice as many
moves as they should.
- Fixed bug with weights of corpses for some
monsters.
- Fixed bug causing crash when monster summons.
- Fixed bug resulting in transparent features.

05-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.8 "Artificial Intelligence"
release

- Changed (Holy Avenger) weapons to of Arnor, and
(Defender) weapons to of Numenor.
- Changed some artifacts around as to which have
race specific ESP.
- Implemented random artifacts from newest
randart.c patch. However, all games now have 255
artifacts, with artifacts not in a_info.txt
generated randomly.
- Implemented pathing and flow from the 4GAI
patch for monsters. Note that this 
considerably increases the difficulty at low
levels as 'random movers' attack you every
turn now.
- Fixed a bug with some monster blows being
initialised with the wrong effect.
- Fixed a bug with placement of glowing
terrain and chasms.

02-01-2001 Unangband 0.4.7c Bugfix release
- Race specific ESP has been implemented, added to
the high slay weapons and the occasional artifact.
- Slayers and killers occasionally sense monsters
that they get bonuses against.
- The low slay weapons were removed because they
were not useful enough.
- Some staffs give you abilities while wielded...
they are also fairly good weapons (1d6, 5 lbs),
not much worse than whips. You'll have to enchant
them up yourself though.
- A lot of internal tidy up to do with features.
- And a lot more features.
- Glowing players now have radius 2 light.
- Improved boundary condition checking for wand/staff
charges (Reported by Larry Bassel).
- Goblin wizard was wrong graphic (Reported by Larry
Bassel).
- Brand weapon/bless weapon/enchant weapon to resist
allowed a lot earlier, in fact before similar enchant
weapon/armor spells. This is because they can only
be used once per weapon/armor and not on ego equipment.
- Created scrolls of brand weapon/armor/bless weapon.
- Bard hold songs not aborted if they cast another
spell. However they still have the option to abort if
they try to cast a spell (Idea from Pernband). This
allows them to do one powerful spell and keep back-
ground singing.
- Fixed multiple problems with spell list display
including issues with displaying specialist spells
as difficult even when learnt (Reported by Larry
Bassel).
- Update s_info.txt file to include spell definitions.
This will be expanded to include object powers
and activations in the next release.
- Was always guessing an item/ego item, if we
had made a guess for the item. This would overwrite
existing guesses (Reported by Larry Bassel).
- We were allowing hands to be generated for any
monster.

27-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.7b Bugfix release
- Fixed long-standing bug in lake generation routine
that was cause of significant crashes in previous
versions.
- Fixed problems with animation of objects.
- Added ability to quaff from fountains, study at/pray
at altars, climb down wells and so forth.
- Fixed problems with names of monster containers.

26-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.7a Bugfix release
- Fixed bug with statues resulting in infinite loops.
- Added rock hounds.
- Added bottles, cages, figurines, sacks, boxes.
- Some internal changes to tval/sval names.

26-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.7 "Silent Night release"
- Modified monster drops so that each tval will only
be dropped by some types of monsters.
- Don't remember all types of floors. Need to get
these to color correctly in a future release.
- Made brass lanterns orange, like brass monsters, and
shards of pottery light umber.
- Updated cockroaches to use correct graphic.
- Night and mirkwood goblins did too much melee damage.
- Fixed bug with reading in inscription preferences.
- Fixed bug with filling from stack of lanterns.
- Remove duplicated unique eagles in monster list.
- Added option to allow more than 255 features in
dungeon. Most of the new feature flags are not
implemented yet. You'll also need to switch on the new
Variant save-file option so that you don't lose the
features when you save your game.
- Changed rods/spells to use timeouts rather than pvals.
All artifacts now charge in pack and floor as well as
when wielded.
- Added variant_drop_body option to allow monster
corpses. Regenerate monsters need their corpse destroyed
or they will quickly come back to life.
- Added eggs which hatch into monsters after a length of
time.
- Changed chests to be a floor item and use the '*'
graphic. Some of the trapped chests match treasure in
wall graphic, but only when trap detected on them.
- Renamed stone visages to stone idols.
- Faerie lights were way wrong.

21-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.6c Bugfix release
- Saruman the Many-Colored was not multi-hued :(
- Added ATTR_METAL for metallic/gem monsters, to flicker
between 2 hues, rather than fully multi-hued.
- Updated gem/metallic monsters to use this new flag.
- Removed FORGET flag from 2 low level monsters who have
it.
- Fix bug with loading old characters resulting in
exhaustion.
- Changed variant_fast_moves to save-file option and
defaulted to FALSE.
- Added variant_unsummon option which slows summoning
somewhat.
- Potions of restoring had the wrong sval in k_info.txt.
- Added option to allow spell casters to learn more
than 64 spells (Up to limit allowed by intelligence).
- Fixed problem where resting would use up a lot of
turns (Reported by Larry Bassel).
- Moved all unimplemented stuff into a todo folder under
lib.

17-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.6b Bugfix release
- Detect curse now senses all cursed items.
- Gauge magic was not correctly marking cursed items
(Reported by Larry Bassel).
- Forgot to mention that 0.4.6a included option controlling
prompting for to always inscribe items (easy_autos).
- Reworked shops so that potions of restoring (New item,
replaces restore strength, dexterity etc.) appear in temple,
restore str, dex, etc. no longer appear in alchemist, and 
identify and speed now appear in alchemists. Identify is
now more expensive.
- Becoming aware of an item means you'll guess everything
on the level again (Except home).
- Added 'Start searching if not disturbed' option, to make
new fast_move code a lot easier on the user.
- Fixed bug with guessing wands of wonder (Reported by
Larry Bassel).
- Novice necromancers were appearing too early, and had
the wrong graphic.

16-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.6a Bugfix release
- Fixed gauge magic so that it cannot be used on items where
IDENT_BONUS reveals no information, and correctly handles
identification cases as required (Reported by Larry Bassel).
- Fixed problem where bonuses could be known on equipment,
without telling updating known character information
(Reported by Larry Bassel).
- Fixed problem where you could wield items from equip
when you did not have variant_belt_slot option, causing the
item to disappear.
- Further refinements to identify system as I think of more
cases that need handling. Should not now 'orphan' may flags
on objects, resulting in false positive identifies. Also
handle all cases of objects being thrown away, destroyed,
stolen etc.
- Tidy up messages for new wielding systems.
- Fixed bug with destruction prompting wrong item for auto-
inscription.
- Setting an auto-inscription with the inscribe or destroy
commands sets it for all known items in the dungeon.
- Added variant_fast_moves option, which allows player to
move quickly while not searching, at the expense of tiring
out.
- Added ability to swim underwater. With variant_fast_moves,
you quickly run out of air... otherwise you are just
slowed.
- Changed around the handling of swimming, so that you will
tire yourself out instead of drowning randomly. However,
being paralyzed/knocked out in water/mud/etc. will cause
you to drown. Since when you run out of air, you become
paralyzed, you will quickly drown.
- Water damage of all sorts douses non-magical lights.
- Fire/plasma/lava attacks now provide information about
the grids they attack.
- Light/light weak attacks also light up adjacent grids.
- Fixed bug where safe grids were coming up identical to
floor grids (Reported by Larry Bassel).
- Artifacts no longer get auto-inscriptions.
- Added kind/ego item/tval menus to autoinscription command
($).


15-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.6 "Under New Management" release
- Added ability to wield any item for half the energy use when
using it (Such as casting spells, firing ammo, throwing etc).
- Added belt slot, which allows any item to be wielded into it
from equipment, with the same advantages.
- Added auto-inscription facility designed to allow objects/
ego items/artifacts to be automatically inscribed when id'ed
or generated aware.
- Added '=k' inscription to destroy item when picked up, '=d'
inscription to not pick up an item, '=i' inscription to not
mark an item. Use in conjunction with auto-inscription (Above)
to mimic auto-squelch from other variants.
- Inscribe/uninscribe/destroy commands now request if inscription
is to be applied to all objects of that type.
- Made unarmed combat apply whenever object wielded that is not
a weapon/digger, and use gloves/boots as weapon. Should make
gauntlets of slaying very useful for martial artist types now.
- Fixed bug preventing guessing of artifacts and ego items.
- Started work on variant.txt help file.
- Fixed bug preventing wielding of swords without removing shield
first.

13-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.5e Bugfix release
- Fixed bug where rings of flame/acid/frost were still getting
base AC from k_info.txt. (Reported by Sean Lester).
- Fixed bug where charging artifacts would report themselves as
charged every turn (Reported by Sean Lester).
- Fixed bug where activating a stack of rings would cause all items
in the stack to start charging (Reported by Sean Lester).

12-12-2001
- Made metallic dragon armour have 2 resists, and activate for
one of 2 breaths (Lower elemental breath does double damage). Also
added brass/copper/silver dragon armor.
- Made rings report their activations when *identified*. (Reported
by Sean Lester).
- Added trees from a post I recovered from back in the day (Thanks
Google).
- Upgraded Werewolf speed/vision/alertness to equal that of wolf,
and added some spells (Suggestion from same post).
- Made normal elementals FORCE_MAXHP.
- Make get_check accept '0' as no, and '7' as yes. This allows you
to almost completely free yourself to use the numeric keypad while
exploring. Finger positioning adopted from rogue keyset. (eg 'y'
is northwest, and 'n' is in same finger position as 0 key).
- Removed extra blow from paladins/extra shot from rangers and
set warriors to blows speed as paladins (But note almost all
warriors get one extra blow) (Suggested from newsgroup by Timo
Pietilä).
- Modified monster saving throws so that sleep/slow/fear/
confusion can affect uniques unless specifically excepted, and
have a harder saving throw (Suggested from newsgroup by Joseph
William Dixon). Should probably go through and add NO_ flags to
uniques where appropriate.
- Made uniques recover faster from the above effects, also heal
more rapidly, to balance out the above change.

10-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.5d Bugfix release
- Fixed bug with transmute rock to mud messages (Reported by
Larry Bassel).
- Added cheat_lore option, allowing full artifact/ego item information
as if known. Use primarily as debug tool for guessing artifacts/ego
items.
- Added reseed_artifacts option, to allow multiple characters to
play with same random artifact set if desired.

7-12-2001
- Added ring of ice/flames/acid activations from Angband 2.9.5-alpha.
Removed AC bonus.
- Added option to allow up to 5 rings to be worn on each hand.
- Added ability to activate stacked items correctly.
- Allow specification of preferred monsters (Flags and graphics) to
t_info.txt.
- Allowed 2-weapon combat. Weapons be same base type (ie same tval
and sval) or secondary weapon must be a TV_SWORD of less than 10 lbs
in weight. Blows computed from weight of primary weapon + twice
weight of secondary weapon.
- Fixed bug where slow attacks would also drain your strength.
- Fixed a bug where deep pits could occur on level 1.
- Fixed a bug where all new terrain was being defined as permanent,
preventing stairs being placed under player.
- Fixed a bug where piles of earth would appear in some tunnels
through earth.

6-12-2001
- Added the ability to stack unidentified pval stacks again.

4-12-2001 Unangband 0.4.5c Bugfix release
- Added and modified a number of uniques in r_info.txt.
- Lots of debugging and modification to stacking code. Should be 100% now.
- Changed option menus around to reflect options we can default to true,
and options we default to false because we use these to add or subtract
additional fields from the save file.
- Guardian monsters only generate at night in town. During day, shops are
accessible.
- Updated character dump to display Unangband version (Hardcoded).

30-11-2001 Unangband 0.4.5b Bugfix release
- Fixed problem with crashing when updating stores by reverting to 0.4.3
store code (again).
- Fixed problem with never generating stairs down on level 1.

27-11-2001 Unangband 0.4.5a Bugfix release
- Fixed problem with logical inversion in stores.c allowing purchase of all
items for free except in home.

26-11-2001 Unangband 0.4.5 "Option Pack"
- Now support stacking of pvals and timeouts. Pvals stacked if equal
or 1 less than existing item pval, or if stack_force_pvals option in
effect. Timeouts stacked if stack_force_timeouts in effect.
- Items inscribed with '=s' behave if all stacking options are in
effect. eg you can force all torches to stack now by inscribing one
of them with '=s', rather than fiddling with options.
- Added rod and scrolls of gauge magic. These identify the to hit/
damage/ac bonuses and number of charges an item has.
- Replace first recharge spell with Gauge Magic. This should make
rogues/rangers/mages a bit more viable identification wise early
on, particularly for rangers.
- If an item is used sufficiently, it will now be sensed in addition
to having its hit/damage/ac bonus revealed, and in circumstances where
no further information is to be learnt about the item, it will be
treated as identified.
- Items now blend usage counts when 'absorbed'.
- Player now guesses more about the object, by hazarding a guess
about what ego item or artifact it is, or kind of object (For rings,
amulets etc.) when he learns information about it.
- Do a lot more hopefully correct learning of object abilities,
by fixing situations where we didn't take into account that we already
knew an object we are using provides this ability, and situations where
we know the identified object cannot provide the ability (ie is not
an ego item/artifact, or is fully identified).
- Added a whole lot of options to control game play elements.
- Use options smartly to maintain backwards save file compatibility.
- Added campaign mode, which is extremely buggy.

13-11-2001 Unangband 0.4.4 "Lost Legends"
- Lots of changes lost because I had my laptop stolen :( Lesson. Back
up to ftp when you are doing stuff (The Linus backup technique).
- Lost changes (Just to make you guys sick): Another 600-700 monsters.
Another 200-300 items. Updates to Unangband to include to JLE 2.9.3
patch. Work on Unangband borg. Implementation of some of what I did
on todo list on web site (And discovered a lot of it doesn't add to
game play much). Two weapon combat (Easy enough to reimplement).
- Stuff I lost that annoys me: Bug fixes.
- Decided to change direction. Rather than running off and creating 
a full fledged varient, I will maintain Unangband pretty much in its
current form, but continue to update it to match the latest version of
Angband.
- I will wait until Angband 2.9.4 comes out before updating however,
as I want the random artifact code and big screen patches.
- However, I don't want scripting (At this stage). So I'll probably
roll back lua changes.
- Will try and get feature flag code and item memory code into main
tree as these are the two most wide ranging changes (From a code
point of view), and will create the most work for me to keep updating.
They are also most 'value-add' to Angband as far as I can tell.
- I suspect item memory code will be 'impossible' because of lua
changes however.
- I'll consider proposing to Oangband guys to work on incorporating
Unangband features into Oangband code base. This varient seems to
be the most progressive in terms of maintaining play balance while
improving the game.
- If I could I'd spend as much time developing as Dark God and friends
and come out with the full fledged varient with wilderness, allies,
quests etc. But I can't (At least not until I retire in 50+ years).
Sorry guys.
ACTUAL CHANGES CONTINUE FROM HERE:
- Made Druids get Magic Missle at level 1.
- Changed it so that the smart monster spell selection randomly
resolves tie breakers.
- Made warriors of all types get 1 extra blow at level 1 in their
speciality (Except missile weapons, who get 1 extra shot),
as well as rangers, paladins and archers. Non-specialists always
get an extra blow (or shot for archers).
- Made druids get icky weapon penalties, when not using
their preferred weapon, or when otherwise specialised.
- Made bards only get icky hands if instrument.
- Made thieves of all types get 1 extra critical at level 1 in their
speciality. Non-specialists always get this benefit.
- Added object information and room description to save files.
- Added 2.9.4-alpha version of the JLE artifact and ego item patches,
including addition of Slay Evil to Defender weapons.
- If you want to dust off any pre 2.9.2 Angband save files, this version
should be (mostly) compatible. Ego items will be a problem in some
instances (Boots/cloaks/shields particularly).
- Ego items memory guesses one ability/sustain/resist abilities now,
and hackily always knows what items do not have xtra abilities.
- Objects such as blades of chaos don't taint ego item memory.
- Ego item and artifact memory should be retained from game to game.
- Allow DROP_GOOD monsters to drop deep scrolls and potions.
- Require ego items dropped by DROP_GREAT monsters to have at least
a minimum level of 1, or minimum 1000 gp cost.
- Modify the depths of ego items to provide a smoother power curve.

27-07-2001 Unangband 0.4.3 "Final Fantasy fix"
- Modify store mass produce cost limits to allow multiple scrolls of
identify scrolls to be created in stores. Some minor fiddling with scroll
costs (Identify/Detect Magic/Curse cheaper, Remove curse slightly more
expensive). However, we reduce the numbers of low cost stock generated.
This may make scrolls of phase door (Probably the most useful of the
low cost items) harder to stockpile. Also has effect of making enchant
scrolls and cure critical wounds easier to stockpile. But high level
priests could already max out their weapons... so this shouldn't be
hugely unbalancing and probably beneficial for warriors.
- Brought back staff of perceptions... at level 45.
- Should have tracked down most if not all missing locations in code for
object info being updated.
- Swapped location of books of Transformations and Destruction.
- You don't get experience now for monsters killed in traps, as this
was open to much abuse. (Reported by Franklin Bratcher).
- Fixed stupid loop resulting from confused monster trying to cast a
spell (Reported by Eytan Zweig).
- Changed book styles so that player receives bonus for spell if it
appears in their style book even if they are casting it from 
another book. This should help many specialists at low level.
- New spells now will display info when browsing or selecting, if
relevant.
- Changed book styles so that the player also can cast spells some
levels lower if the spell is in their book style, so that many styles
eg of Power, of Lore, are actually useful now. This may be unbalancing
in some instances (ie create gold at level 36), note however that
the mana costs remain unchanged.
- There were user interface issues with listing spells once you learnt
your 33rd spell, which have been fixed (Reported by Christopher Pollard)
- The same bug was preventing studying of more than 33 spells.
(Reported by Christopher Pollard)
- Unimplemented spells should now be illegible.
- Blessing/prayer/chant provides temporary hold life.
- Fixed bug where heroism/beserk strength would mark equipment as having
resist fear.
- Add notifications for detecting flags when wielding/shooting/meleeing
with an object.
- Fix last known crasher due to an uninitialised variable (Reported
by Sean Lester).
- Removed low mana warning until we implement an option for this
(Reported by Franklin Bratcher).

25-07-2001 Unangband 0.4.2 "Magic Mushroom fix"
- Added object info. This tries to be smart about what we notice from hitting
monsters and attack effects on us, and notifies the player in instances where
an object must provide a particular power.
- Also hackily sets up some obvious flags for the player.
- Also hackily gives timed information on some less obvious flags for the
player. This is silently done, and requires that the player swap equipment
around, and retain the older stuff.
- Also provides hit/dam/ac information after an object has been used at least
500 times (This value may be too low).
- Also hackily identifies an object after it has been used a lot
(At least 20000 times).

24-07-2001
- Currently, some stateful information about monster hidden/over is not
recorded in the save file. This needs to be corrected.
- Added mushrooms of mana which restore 2d5 mana when eaten. (Suggested on
newsgroup).
- Mushroom patches now drop mushrooms 'appropriate' to the patch type. As
a result, all cursed mushrooms have a predictable flavour. This can be
disabled via a pre-compile option.
- And we finally implement drops for Farmer Maggot's dogs... a small
kindness for mages. Note also now, a wand of clone monsters is useful for
farming magic mushroom patches...
- Instruments can be sold in stores.
- Some minor tidy up of monsters.
- Due to sign reversal, we were never confusing/scaring/slowing the player
when monsters cast spells.
- Gave druids magic missile, so they can be playable at lower levels.

23-07-2001 Unangband 0.4.1 Feature and bugfix release
- Walking onto an invisible trap at level 0 would infinitely loop, never
finding a trap. Now we force trap selection at level 3, if in town.
- Actually make most melee/shooting styles work proper (Logic and flag errors).
- Make climbing/flying monsters ignore terrain damage.
- Get spore spells working, and make wail spells like gazes instead of spits.
- Detect magic/curse now senses all items it detects, as opposed to just items
in inventory. It will probably need to be balanced out some more (Comments
welcome).
- Added superb (Ego items with xtra powers), great (15+ combined to hit and
damage, or 9+ AC), and very good (9+ combined to hit and damage or 5+ AC)
feelings for detect magic/heavy inventory sensing. Superb isn't working at
the moment however, will need to debug.
- Monsters with pass wall now can hide in all terrain they can resist.
- Player will be notified if a visible monster hides, or if a monster
emerges from hiding to become visible
- Rods of dowsing do something.
- Fixed summon specifics for various changes in monster char types.
- Add CAN_FLY to some killer beetles.
- Make sure we only see descriptions while looking if we have already seen
room.
- Remove rods and rings from room descriptions. Change sooty rooms to have
flasks of oil, instead of torches.
- Made general store sell first 2 songbooks.
- Bards should hold songs now.
- Changed way id styles work so that aware items can be sold at correct
prices.
- Added more thief, warrior, paladin styles. Moved some rogue styles to
mage and added other mage styles.
- Walk through hidden monsters rather than attack them.

19-07-2001 0.4.0c Bugfix release
- Quartz and magma power was 10 too high in f_info.txt (Reported by Leon
Marrick).
- Made identify scrolls appear earlier in dungeon, and slightly cheaper
(Requested by Leon Marrick). Also made Detect Magic scrolls cheaper. This
may change again once object id code goes in.
- Referencing wrong flags for checking to drop items, resulted in items
frequently disappearing (Reported by Leon Marrick).
- Running was not checking the right way for instances when touching some
walls. (Reported by Leon Marrick).

18-07-2001
- Made a great number of features more commonly available as well as modified
a number of them.
- Thieves accidentally started with really bad stealth. Fixed.
- Monsters were never climbing or flying.
- Backstab now works against fleeing monsters. Criticals from styles do not
work against non-living opponents.

18-07-2001 0.4.0b Bugfix release
- Angband was generating 9 monsters for every call to vault monster. Changed
this to 1, but allowing a monster of up to 5 levels out of depth now.
- Notified the player if they are dealing with a hidden monster.
- Fixed many problems with room descriptions, particularly initialisation.


17-07-2001 0.4.0a Bugfix release
- Because I changed the logic of hitting traps and finding secrets to
fix some bugs before releasing 0.4.0, I (mildly) broke some functionality.
Walking on a SECRET damaging terrain would not discover the secret, although
the description was displayed. This is now fixed.
- Gave smart monsters a chance of disarming traps equal to the chance of
breaking glyphs. This is for free, and so they don't 'waste' their time
trying to disarm traps.
- Fixed it so monsters were actually hit by traps and features (Logic bug
in code).
- Fixed it so invisible trapped doors could activate a trap.
- Allowed monsters to hit invisible traps and trapped doors. They must pick
a trapped door so they don't get stuck in the door. We hackily allow
out of knowledge invisible floor traps to not be activated.
- Made trails more trail like... and inform the player if they travel through
dusty locations.
- Forget locations that become boring...
- Made features scatter around a room more.
- Had describe room in the wrong place in the lighting code. Comes of adding
a feature at the last minute and not testing (See above).
- Fixed weird mana bug problem, and restricted spells learnable in a more
clear manner. You will now think you can learn spells even if a book is not
available for you to do so (This is probably a regression).
- Made much more stuff climbable for monsters.

16-07-2001 Unangband 0.4.0 "Mystery" release aka "War against the Angels"
aka "Angry Young Man"

- Massive changes implemented.
- c_info.txt and w_info.txt added, which allows definition of classes.
- 4 new classes added: archers, thieves, druids and bards.
- All classes have styles (sub-classes) added. These add additional
abilities defined in the w_info.txt at the cost of 10% additional
experience. See birth.c for details. This effectively means over 100
classes.
- 130 new spells added. (Summon spells not implemented yet).
- 5 new prayer books, 17 new spell books, and song books for bards added.
- Bards continue to sing songs after being cast.
- Instruments created for bard (musicians).
- Context sensitive help (Needs help file to be editted).
- over 500 new creatures added.
- 230 room descriptions added. See d_info.txt for details.
- Significant debugging and changes to feature code.
- Fixed some game killer bugs. Running and looking work.
- Game is definitely playable now.

10-04-2001
- Conversion completed to 2.9.1. Actually less dramatic than the time
difference here suggests, mostly due to interruption by a production of
'King Lear' (Great play), and other Real Life (tm). Needs to be tested
and verified that all code ported across correctly.
- Tidied up f_info.txt to 2.9.1. Modified readme.txt.
- Picked up additional bugs in code base.

07-11-2000
- Conversion begun to 2.9.1 code base
- Throwing now applies damage as melee and missile weapons
- Fixed bug in some project paths not using new flags
- Spiking now uses easy open option

04-11-2000
- Monsters/traps now confuse/hold/blind/slow other monsters using the
monster level or the trap power, not the same value as the player (Which
was meaningless).
- Features destroyed by fire/acid/cold only if damage is greater than
10*feature power now.
- Fleeing monsters get pushed past, and push past other monsters, unless
they are confused or KILL_BODY
- Monsters stealing objects now flee instead of blinking. Because of the
other changes, they should get further away now.
- Theft traps no longer leak an object. They drop the item on the ground
near the player or lose it completely.

03-11-2000
- Monsters can cast innate spells while confused, but will randomly target
locations around them.
- Monsters will attack other monsters while confused.
- Monsters can now target other monsters with their spells but should only
do so while confused.
- Monsters can cast spells while out of line of sight.
- Reduced maximum number of monsters in groups from 32 to 8.
- Various tidy ups with feature code.


19-11-2000
- Removed icy water of various types as this was indistinguishable from water
and didn't cause much damage. Still need to clean up code as a result.
- Removed damage from geothermal and icy floors. These just hint that there
(may) be creatures swimming underneath now.
- Made ice transparent and cause ice damage (rather than cold) and act as a
trap (So tunnelling damages, but standing on does not)
- Added various ice features to support transparent ice.
- Removed ATTR_LITE flag (as not used frequently) and seperated MOVE and PROJECT

18-11-2000
- Continued debugging and tidying up of features
- Make chasms always have an edge, except for bridges over the chasm

- Added drowning in deep features.

05-11-2000

features
- Added descriptions for all GF_ attacks to monster memory

type at a distance, either via ball, bolt or LOS
- Replaced ARROW_X spells with a single SHOOT spell, which applys monster blows
of type SHOOT at a distance

04-11-2000
- Updated changes.txt file.
- Started todo.txt file.
- Started future.txt file. We list high priority easy fix stuff in the todo.txt
file, and save lower priority cool stuff for this file.
- Started bugs.txt file to document known bugs that have not been resolved.
Bugs are listed seperately from todo.txt.

Changes before 04-11-2000  UnAngband 0.1.0 "Blackbelt" release
- Created new f_info.txt file format with numerous changes documented in that
file. The majority of changes are implemented in init1.c and/or code. See
bugs.txt and todo.txt for incomplete/buggy components.
- Changed majority of code to use flags and other new entries in f_info
required for f_into.txt. This is a widespread change and is not completed yet.
- Created numerous new features, including new traps, trapped doors, water,
lava, ice, acid. This change is too big to mention here, and the philosophy
behind it (And the particular meanings of the flags) is best discussed in the
f_info.txt file. The emphasis is on terrain that will correctly overlap each
other, and is usefully interacted with by monsters and the player. We also
pick stuff that makes (the most) sense in an underground setting, with
increasing risk as the player gets lower in the dungeon.
- Changed generate.c to generate features, emphasising simple terrain
generation algorithms over complex, hard to understand or define stuff. Note
that this still needs lots of balancing/testing to get right, perhaps by
increasing the overall size of the dungeon.
- Changed RBE_ data types to GF_ data types and implemented in init1.c,
spells1.c and melee1.c. We can define monsters that attack with any possible
GF_ type now, and they use the project_p code to attack the player. This will
allow lots of funky stuff in the future, and makes implementing traps a lot
easier.
- Changed smart monster spell selection to always pick the highest damage
attack against a player for SMART monsters, and more likely for not-STUPID
monsters. This encourages monsters to learn resistance against their primary
attack first, and then drop to potentially less powerful attacks. However,
it makes smart monsters really smart in their attack selection. This should
be offset by decreased overall monster damage, otherwise the player will get
killed very quickly.
- Changed melee attacks against monsters to be decreased by monster armour,
much in the same way as monster attacks against the player are reduced. This
is part of an overall effort to make monster/player combat symetrical.
- Scaled monster hit points down by the same factor. This should give spells
more effect against monsters, while decreasing the overall effectiveness of
breath weapons except for very high hit point monsters. We scale this during 
- Changed missile attacks to use the same damage algorithm as melee attacks
rather than multiplying slays/brands after adding bonuses. This should be
offset by the scaling down of monster hit points in most instances, as we
still don't count armour for missile attacks (Similiarly to what monsters do).

-Fixed a bug that allowed the player to gain info about unidentified

- The Windows version no longer requires changes to angband.ini when
  installing.  The angband.ini file will be created when you first start

  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.
- Terminal windows
  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.
  Just toggle the display you want for "Term-1" and "Term-2".
- Added a stone-background to the terminals.
- Midi jukebox
  DOS-Angband automatically plays midi-files from the "lib/xtra/music"
  folder in your Angband-directory.

  corresponding Angband-event. You can configure the available samples in
  the "lib/xtra/sound/sound.cfg" file.  Multiple sounds per event are
  supported.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm').
