### Game Play ###

- Vents now act as conduits for water, acid, steam, fire or gas through walls.
Vents can also be climbed through, but block vision and ranged attacks.

- Falling water, lava, and so on now only cause damage to adjacent terrain every
second turn.

- It should now be possible to create trapped areas as follows (where < is falling
terrain and % is a vent):

####.      #####.
#<%%.   or #<%%%.
####.      #####.

This results in the the floor locations getting hit, on the left, every 3 turns,
or on the right every 4 turns (an adjacent water fall will hit every 2 turns).

- Cracked walls now can come in hidden, weaker versions that can be easily
bashed or tunnelled through.

### User Interface ###

- Monster recall now reports what particular types of items are dropped by each
monster.

### Bug fixes ###

- Prevented original graphic tiles from trying to use dark and lite tiles.

- Added Triple tile mode, which is like Double tile mode, but intended for
use with David Gervais' 54x54 graphics tiles (As 54 is not divisible by 4).

- Improve scrolling when setting visuals.

- Greatly improved isometric tile mode, so that it is now a playable option.
In particular, all tiles are correctly drawn and redrawn after every refresh.
However, many more monsters/objects etc. need to have the correct tiles
assigned to them and there are still visual artefacts that need to be
cleaned up.

- Priest spell righteous fury was for mages, paladins, shamans and bards but
not for priests.  Now it is for priests, paladins, shamans and bards.  (Fixed
by kobayasi)

- Enchant food was in a wrong slot in the prayer book of chants so one can
learn it (randomly) but cannot cast it.  (Fixed by kobayasi)

- The effect of experience was as same as self knowledge.  (Fixed by kobayasi)

### Build / Platform ###

- Makefile.std was reporting errors if the files it tries to clean are not
there (Reported by Robert Ruehlmann).

- Separated out cave flags that are specific to the cave (cave_info) and
specific to the player (play_info) in preperation for implementing 4GAI
projection algorithms. This has to be done differently from Sangband et al.
as there can be terrain in Unangband that blocks line of sight but not 
spells or arrows (eg smoke). At the moment, most of these new flags are
not used. WARNING: AT THE MOMENT THIS BREAKS SAVE FILE COMPATIBILITY!!!!

Unangband 0.5.5: "New Years Resolution"

### Game Play ###

- Much better handling of features which have corresponding objects 'stored'
in them, such as fountains, water, and so on.

- You can now destroy objects contained inside many features to change that
feature automatically eg destroying a torch in a torch feature.

- You can use the examine command on a feature that contain objects to create
instances of that object without having to throw the objects, refuel from it
or so on.

- You can now create 'flavoured' features, which contain differing instances
of the same object type, depending on the level at which the feature is
located. This is currently unused, but is intended to support different
types of fountains, trees, mineral veins and so on.

### User Interface ###

- Added 'show sidebar' option, which defaults to yes. Setting this to no moves
information normally on the left hand side of the main display to a more compact
format at the bottom of the window, making more space available for the map
display.

- Added experimental Double tile mode (Windows only), which is has tiles
twice as wide and high as regular tiles. When used along with big tiles, results
in tiles four times as wide and twice as high. Because the tiles have increased 
height as well as width, double tiles are currently not used in several areas that
support regular tiles. There are currently some visual artifacts.

- Added support for transparency in David Gervais's 32x32 support for
Windows users. This requires a (slightly altered) 32x32.bmp and a matching
mask32.bmp file and is (a little) more correct than equivelent X11 masking.

- Added experimental support for David Gervais's isometric tiles (Windows
only). This is currently 'proof-of-concept' only and does not require SDL.
However, it will result in many visual artifacts, and does not have many
tiles correctly assigned. Advantages from Hajo's Iso-metric tile support
include two differing iso-metric projections (Switched by toggling big tile
mode on and off), scaleable tile sizes, and support for mixing isometric
tiles and text (This is not possible on the main map though). Disadvantages
include no support for dynamically recolouring of tiles, no support for
lighting effects, incorrect draw order for tiles, incorrect masking of tiles
in front and behind, and other visual artefacts that currently make this 
(mostly) unusable. Do not attempt to assign tiles using the visual tile
assigner at this stage, as the supplied 54x54.bmp and mask54.bmp file are
only temporary and some poorly 'glued' together.

- Fixed some visual artifacts caused by the assumption that graphics tile
0 is a floor tile.

- Can now use 'k' in knowledge menus to toggle auto-destruction of objects,
'g' to toggle auto-pickup, 'i' to toggle auto-ignore, 's' to toggle auto-
stack. Other unrecognised characters will set a similiar auto-inscription
however these have no effect.

- "Great" weapons and ammo now much more likely to have additional damage
dice or sides. (From NPPAngband)

- If you specify a different terrain for invisible traps, it is used to
identify unsafe floors.

### Bug fixes ###

- Many low level spell casting monsters were casting mana bolt instead of
magic missile.

- Objects were incorrectly being initialised as aware, as per Angband. Now
only become aware when you see the object for the first time.

- Could not see some objects (eg corpses) in knowledge menus as they did
not randomly appear in the dungeon. (Reported by topazg).

- Delete the dump.prf file after generating a screen dump, to prevent this
file becoming excessively large.

- Fixed broken html dump code.

- Non-ego weapons with improved damage dice or sides now sense as "great".

- You could spike a door multiple times to break it (Reported by @nothere).

- Doors did not appear jammed after first spiking them (Reported by @nothere).



UnAngband 0.5.4c: "Competitive Fix"

### Game Play ###

- Snow, particularly deep snow, is riskier again.

### User Interface ###

- Improved user interface for selecting which location to travel to.

### Bug fixes ###

- The chance of tunnelling was out by a factor of 10 (Reported by Jeffrey
Turner).

- Piles of earth were removed, resulting in 'nothing' occuring in some rooms.
(Reported by Anthony Holmes).

- Occasionally on the far right of the map, the wrong panel would be displayed
(Reported by Anthony Holmes).

- Isengard should now be full of trees again.


UnAngband 0.5.4b: "Survival of the Fittest"

### Game Play ###

- The Dale now has a food supply (Bug 588).

- If you fire or thrown an object that misses a monster, it will continue to
travel along the line of fire, possibly hitting other monsters in its path.

- The variant and save file options are now compulsory, and removed from the
user interface.

- One rod in a stack of recharging rods will recharge in (t - n) time, where
t is the timeout of the stack and n is the number of rods recharging. This
allows rods to be reused more quickly, and where the rod timeout is less than
stack size, you can reuse a rod every turn.

- You can notice hidden features at greater ranges, but features deeper in
the dungeon are harder to notice (From Sangband).

- Torches have a larger light radius when they are more fuelly fueled (From
Sangband).

- You now hold or stay after each step, so that you will use 100 energy per
move unless you are disturbed.

### User Interface ###

- Now supports specifying whether or not a feature supports advanced lighting
options in the pref file.

- Knowledge menu sub-items are sorted alphabetically. This could be changed 
in the future to allow a selection of possible sort orders (Depth, kills etc).

- 'view_flavors' option is added, which allows you to display, eg, known rings
of speed using a different graphics consistently from game to game. This also
allows all the David Gervais known scroll graphics to be used when a scroll is
found. Switch this option from TRUE (The Angband default) to FALSE to enable
this.

- Display problems due to Windows XP eliminated by not using the centred dot
character.

### Bug fixes ###

- Eilineil the Entrapped is now a female (Bug 648).

- The ruins of Lake-town are no longer too deep for those who flee the Lonely
Mountain (Bug 589).

- Objects resistant to damage will only display a message the first time they
are unaffected (Bug 682).

- Support transparency for graphics modes (Bug 782).

- Updated pref files required for 32x32 bit maps (Bug 777).

- Improved 'visual' editting code from Hengband (Bug 778).

- Fixed map refresh bugs caused in big tile mode (Bug 780).

- Improved support for advanced lighting features in graphics mode (Bug 779).

- Handle being stuck inside terrain correctly in all instances (Bug 807).

- Fixed spurious and incorrect messages when monster hits player trap (Bug
808).

- Monsters can now tunnel (Bug 605).

- Monsters will no longer push each other around, preventing them from
moving or attacking successfully (Bug 653).

- Hidden monsters can no longer pick up objects from the ground or be hit
by missile or thrown weapons (Bug 654).

- Priest spell banish evil now works (Bug 681).

- Can no longer browse illegible spells (Bug 253).

- Spells and items that brand objects correctly tell you which brand they
provide when inspected or browsed.

- Additional features can be editted from within knowledge menus.

- Can correctly edit the displayed graphic for tree tops.

- Flavoured items are now correctly displayed when unknown for all graphics.

- Character dump version updated.

### Build / Platform ###

- Remove references to nangband in makefile.

- Reduce compiler warnings through bogus assignments. I have mixed thoughts on
this, as to whether it is better to change function declarations than use
bogus assignments, or perhaps leave warnings intact. These warnings only occur
in GCC 3 or later.


UnAngband 0.5.4a: "A Whole Lotta Love"

### Game-play ###

- Added high-level guardians to remaining areas in campaign mode.

- Replaced fletchers with jewellers in Edoras.


### Build / Platform ###

- readdib.[ch] were old.

- Some dungeon names are misspelt.

- Loading an old savefile crashed the game.

- Some spell flags were not handled in spell_desc()

- You could not tonnnel cages while stuck in them.

- Some boolean variables are incorrectly set when getting bit flags.

- teleport_away() was swapping a monster and another monster or a
  player if there is one on a random place.

- A window flag for "Display room description" window was not saved.

- Fixed a minor bug about monster recall flag on OLD_DRAIN spell.

- The game crashed at the end of the game.

- Object usage counters for armors are never updated.

- When an object become known to have some flags, may flags
  on all kits should be removed.

- "(D) Base Delay Factor" was not displayed.

- It was possible to destroy cursed equipments.

- Fixed the bug which forbids more than 64 spells by introduciing new
  option "variant_study_more" which really allows more than 64 spells
  to be studied.  Old option "variant_more_spells" is left for
  savefile compatibility, and now effects only on the number of spell
  kind.

- The game occasionally crashed when shooting at nearly dead monster.

- Changed form of Wizard Lock to BEAM from STRIKE to correctly close
  and jam an open door.

- Behavior of Wizard lock was wrong.

- Really fixed bug where Ungoliant was not a female.



UnAngband 0.5.4: "It'll be Sangband next" (Out the door release)

### Game Play ###

- Added the ability to create a trap using any object using the 'j'am command
('S'pike in roguelike keys).

- Waves are now just deep water and do 'weak' water damage rather than normal
water damage.

- Waves in deep water have to be climbed.

- Removed open floors over chasms as unnecessary terrain.

- Geothermal areas now occasionally produce steam.

- You must now climb out of pits/chasms/spider webs/thickets/thorns, taking a
double move.

- Changed how trees are generated to reduce overhead when generating a level.

- Added hilly terrain which uses '<' graphic. This is primarily for expanded
wilderness generation, when that is implemented.

- Added shallow pits, which provide cover for monsters hiding in them.

- Allows runestones to be used from the floor now.

- Spells available on runestones are now affected by the day of the lunar
cycle.

- Fire, acid and so forth will not create smoke, clouds etc. on floors from
a monster or player spell. Traps and other terrain will create this however.

- Clouds and other terrain effects can be created when an object is destroyed.

- Added Sacrificial daggers in place of Tulwars (As suggested by Johnathan Ellis).

- Detect curse no longer marks valueless items as broken.

- Giants now drop potions, making giant pits worthwhile deep in the dungeon.

use special graphics for identified items of various sorts.

- Changed how many locations are displayed so that viewing options affect more
terrain.

- Added option view_surface_lite that allows you to see which terrain is 'indoors'
when you are on the surface (In particular, terrain covered by tree branches).

- Change the way map locations are displayed on the surface when inside or
outside.

- Generate artifact spoilers using object info code.

- Features should only be listed in the knowledge menus if not "mimiced".

- Stone bridges are now G:.:w, but are visibly different from floors.

- Wave crests now use G:':w to distinguish them from steam clouds.

- Trees now use ':' instead of '<'.

- Added 32x32 bmp and big_graphics support.


### Bug fixes ###

'version' of the Zangband wilderness, using Unangband's version of the terrain
graphics. (Uses Zangband 2.7.1). This is for testing purposes and comments...

- Updated copyright notices in source.


UnAngband 0.5.3: "Let It Be" (the Killer Beatle release)

### Game-play ###

items will be known as soon as identified.

- 'I'nspection of *Identified* item will always reveal all its true
abilities regardless of Save File Option.

- Added additional rune combinations to cast spells.

- Added vanilla 3.0 mage spells.

### User Interface ###

- 'I'nspection of *Identified* items doesn't display annoying 'It does
not...' descriptions, and display a simple supplement; 'You know
everything about this item.'

- Variant_save_feats will be automatically turned on as soon as
character is loaded.

- All Save File Options are now default for new save-file.

Unangband 0.5.2b Bugfix release

### Game-play ###

- Shamans start having a scroll of bless weapon

### User Interface ###

- Stores no longer use the large hack they did previously for display
purposes. This will allow the player to set attr/mappings. Also allows
stores to be seen from anywhere on town level.

- Prevent user inscribing or unscribing any unaware objects, also do 
not display inscription in the knowledge menus.

- Changed definition of VERSION_NAME from "Angband" to "Unangband",
  which change name of user directry on unix.


### Bug fixes ###

- Fix various bugs preventing player becoming *winner* on campaign mode.

- Fix bug preventing destroy command from actually destroy bottles on floor.

- Fix bug allowing {cursed} good staves being generated.

- Fix bug that objects of your home disappears occasionally.

- Fix bug allowing blood-stained floor being placed at non-floor grids.

- Fix bug allowing flavored name to be displayed when you examine
  unaware object in store.

- Fix various bugs preventing various spells working correctly.

- Fix various bugs that object memory wasn't correctly
  updated/displayed.

- Fix bug preventing updating auto inscription of ego item as you
  inscribe an ego item.

Unangband 0.5.2a Bugfix release

### Game-play ###

- Bill Ferny now guards the bottom of Bree.

- The Trollshaw forest is now harder.

- Bert, Bill and Tom occur earlier in non-campaign mode.

### User Interface ###

- Added ability to redefine visual prefs using the knowledge menus (~).
This is done via a graphic user interface type setting, allowing you to
see large numbers of possible graphics to select from.

- If you specify a graphic/attr/char mapping for e.g. a potion of speed,
once you become aware of the object, it will use this mapping rather than
still using the flavour attr/char mapping. This for instance allows you
to colour all 'bad' potions/scrolls/etc. dark grey so that you don't
attempt to get them.

- The objects menu under the knowledge menu now lists the flavours of
all unknown objects, primarily so you can interact with the visuals for
these objects. This is different for Eyangband, which lists the objects
you know of, but have not found this game.

- Added reference to new web site at http://unangband.berlios.de.

- Made torches light brown, and other junk dark brown.

### Build / Platform ###

- Removed use of 'near' member of structure as used as a reserved
keyword in VC++.

### Bug fixes ###

- Actually made teleport a lot safer to use. You will not be placed in
potentially dangerous grids.

- Fixed bug where monster could end up in unsafe grids for the monster
after teleporting.

- Fixed bug where town/dungeon name and depth were displayed in wrong
part of screen if window is resized.

- Fixed some flags for various types of terrain.

- Fixed bug where learning a spell would report it as a song (Reported
 by Adam Horowitz).

- Fixed bugs so that you can escape locations where you are stuck other
than by teleporting.

- Partially fixed bug so that at least 'aware' flavoured items are
displayed with correct graphic when using graphics.

Angband 0.5.2 "I'm on fire" release

I have reorganised this changes.txt file to similar to what Eytan Zweig
 uses for Eyangband. It should be clearer what the changes are.

To see what changes have been made for previous versions, check the 
previous release (0.5.1d).

### Game-play ###

- Giant spider webs can now allow spells cast through them.

- You can now no longer recall from a dungeon to a town in a different 
location, as it was too unclear for when this case would apply.

- You can now affect doors and other terrain with bolt spells as well 
as ball spells.

- Smoke/steam removed by cold attacks (Suggested by Adam Horowitz).

- Guardians on surface levels and dungeon towns are now generated
during daytime as well  (But still only night time in surface towns).

- Statues/containers/body parts now give you some information about the
 monster when you discover them.

- Removed Create Golem spell until friendly monsters are implemented.

- Added Heavy Armoury, Heavy Weaponsmith, Runesmith and Chemist and 
added to and reorganised stores in a number of towns.

- Improved store inventories in Jewelers, Marketplace, Barracks and 
Blackmarket to be more appropriate for players at the level they will 
encounter the stores. Note that the Blackmarket in Angband will now 
generate items at a deeper level.

- If you are hidden in darkness, a lot more monsters will use light to
 see by...

- Dungeon entrances are now lit, so they are easier to find at night...

- Added King of the Wood Elves, Faramir, Boromir and Denethor, and 
reorganised some of later campaign to be a smoother transition from end
 of Moria/Isengard/Caradhras.

- Removed escorts from Tom Bombadil, and summon kin, as it felt a little
 'wrong' (Not as bad as killing him of course ;)

- Made dynamic terrain allowing forests to burn down, seas to have waves
 and various other effects, poison gas and smoke to spread and disappate.

- Added waves and wave crests to allow water to have waves in it. These
look and act like 'real' waves.

- Doors and other wooden objects now cause persistent fires, which can be
put out by bashing them.

- Teleport is now a lot safer to use. You will not be placed in
potentially dangerous grids.

- Musical instruments will now occasionally be ego items.

- Torches, lanterns, etc. now will also affect the terrain under them
as well as the monster.

- Some weapons are now 'throwing': to use them, unequip your bow or
cross-bow, and use the fire command. You will see which weapons are
available as throwing weapons. This is currently daggers, batons,
darts, javelins and spears, all potions, flasks, bottles and sling
ammunition.  Throwing weapons get a much greater range, and their
to hit and damage bonuses count for double when fired. Warning:
using the throw command will not give you these benefits.

- Slings can now fire any 'throwing' weapon, allowing you to lob
potions (Such as potions of Detonations) to much greater distances.

- Added Burning arrows and Batons.

- Potions of Death are now very expensive.


### User Interface ###

- Added ability to create html screen dumps similar to T.O.M.E. This can 
be invoked with the ] key on the main map.

- Added ability to create html screen dumps at any time using the Ctrl-
right-bracket (^]) short cut. This uses the current visual preferences 
instead of temporarily reseting these preferences to the underlying 
settings. However it has much greater flexibility, and can be used 
anytime Angband expects user interaction.

- Now use Enter to continue and ESC to restart the character generation
 process.

- Also use Enter to recall an object/monster/ego item/artifact in the
knowledge menus.

- You can now recall objects while you are looking at them. You will 
recall the monster instead if they are a monster body part or container
 or statue...

- Added option view_glowing_lite which applies special (eg torch-lit) 
lighting to boring grids that are adjacent to glowing features such as 
torches in a room. This is another 'pretty' function that may cause a 
slight performance hit, but should make those screen dumps even 
prettier.

- Updated the help files to reflect the above commands.


### Build / Platform ###

- Added readdib.c and removed angband.res to allow compilation for 
makefile.cyg


### Bugfixes ### 

- Fixed bug where archer, shaman, bard classes were getting too many 
blows.

- Fixed bug where ego items would be revealed if they were generated in
 a store, even if subsequently discarded.

- Fixed bug where scrolls of Curse Armour/ Curse Weapon effects were 
reversed.

- Fixed a bug where Bree town levels extended several levels into the 
dungeon. (Most bugs reported by Adam Horowitz for this release).

- Fix division by 0 bug with guard condition in randart generation code
 that was causing crashes at end of character generation.

- Tidied up some problems with terrain causing crasher bugs in campaign
 mode. Also fixed some logic problems.

- Trapped doors should work now.

- Fixed bug preventing creation of town in Minas Tirith.

- Fixed bug where flying/climbing monsters could walk through walls on
the surface.

- Fixed bug where outside locations could end up dark during day time.

- Using some wands from the ground, could cause problems as they could
be destroyed by their effects.

- Fixed bug preventing 'I'nspection of an object displaying anything
to the screen.

- Fixed logic bug: thrown specialists now gain their might/shots
benefits, but only with throwing weapons.

- Fixed bug where loading a deceased character would fail if it was
carrying a random artifact numbered higher than the regular artifacts.
(Reported by Adam Horowitz). This will load any affected save file.
