Special thanks to all those who reported bugs and especially those who fixed them for this release. My
apologies if I didn't get to your bug this time around.

### Game Play ###

- Add low level spell to allow Masters to light rooms.

- Ensure minimum blood debt.

- Reduce summoning debt for some monster types.

- Allow travelling while poison is slowed.

- Allow line of sight/panel/level based spells to affect objects and
grids separately from monsters.

- Improve sensing of non-cursed items using techniques which sense cursed state.

- Improve sensing to note that an item is not cursed when you wield it and it is not cursed, if it was unusual or nonmagical (The other cases were correctly handled prior to this).

- If you sense what bag an item belongs in without identifying the item,
all subsequently created items are similarly sensed

- Make Cure Poison mushrooms cure poison instead of slowing it.

- Rebalance some master summoning spells to be more useful at lower levels, as well as balance some of the resulting summons.

- Differentiate spells which summon a monster, versus those which create or animate a monster. The latter do not incur mana or blood debt and do not leave your service.

- Hatched eggs or rebuilt golems no longer leave your service.

- Lemures are now truly larval.

- Prevent regions 'double-hitting' a grid during the same attack.

- Make some plants strangle.

- Prevent monsters fighting each other from using attacks which would heal their intended target (Reported by vrbones).

- Make player traps more useful: murder holes use up ammunition less frequently; spring-loaded traps never use up ammunition; allow magic items with higher multipliers when set in traps; give bonus shots and damage multipliers to traps set by the player deeper in the dungeon.

- Add identify and recharge item I services to the Magic Shop. These were almost always added by the presence of various Wizard books in those shops, and so unfairly penalized non-Wizard school casters. (Bug 16739, suggested by thorgot). Doubled cost of identify service to compensate.

- Give take item to unseen servants to make them more servant like.

- You now learn monster hit points and armour class based on the number of times you damage the monster, and the number of times you attack the monster with attacks which can miss, instead of the number of times you kill them.

- Make magic mapping dection area consistant with all other detection areas.

### User Interface ###

Unangband 0.6.4 pre-release 4

### Game Play ###

- Add three additional druid spells including a pre-requisite spell
for 3rd book druidic cold spells.

- Add two additional druid spells.

- As the Stone troll uniques are tougher than Ted Sandyman, Bill Ferny
and Lotho, swap the relative depths of the two sets of uniques.

- Improve running algorithm to ignore terrain the player starts near.
The only outstanding item is for the player to be able to follow the
walls of wide corridors more easily.

### User Interface ###

- Add option 'ally_messages' for people who want detailled combat
messages for allies.

- Hitting 'x' while targetting allows you to target your allies.

player (From Angband 3.1.2).

- Add 'h'andle command ('%' in roguelike keyset) which allows you to
choose an item, then specify which command you use with that item.
This will support the inscribing the item with %x where you automatic-
ally choose command 'x' if you handle the item, but that component has
not been implemented yet. There's also quite a bit that can be done on
the menu display side of things. This will at some point support
commands that an item can be the transitive component for e.g. you'll
be able to choose a torch to fuel the one you have equipped, as
opposed to at the moment you have to choose the equipped torch, then
the torch you wish to fuel it with.

- Significantly improve the quality of object and spell descriptions.

- Improve region descriptions.

- For some reason the single space indentation following a line
return in text_out_to_screen was being added to the previous line. I've
removed this for the moment.

- You now notice when examining an object or shape, which objects
or shapes prevent various flags from taking effect.

in the way.

- Provide additional documentation during character creation for
magic, prayer and song book specialisation and school choices.

poisoned. This makes Stinking Cloud and Dust of Sneezing & Choking
much more effective against breeders.

Unangband 0.6.4 pre-release

### Game Play ###

- Made sneaking cap the maximum wake up speed of monsters at close ranges
in return for losing charging and dodging through normal movement. Sneaking
should be used for 2 specific situations: a) if you don't want your allies
to wake up sleeping monsters and b) to avoid waking monsters you are aware
of which are at range 4 or less.

- You can now 's'teal from monsters. This is automatically successful if
they are asleep and uses your stealth skill if they are awake. If you
are detected the monster will be aggravated and alert it's allies. The
's' command still searches if monsters are not adjacent to you - you can
also cancel out of the steal attempt to be offered the chance to search
instead.

- You get warned several turns before a monster wakes up that it is about
to be disturbed. Sneaking will buy you more time this way.

- Town monsters can now fall asleep again or notice the player.

- Magic/priest/spell book specialists are now much more restricted in which
books they can choose from.

- Add birth_no_identify, birth_no_selling and birth_evil options.

- Add good monsters. These are automatically allied to the player when
placed in the dungeon unless the player has the birth_evil flag. Exactly two
monsters are good at the moment (The ones people complain about having to kill).

- Add 'O'ffer an item command. This allows you to give items to your allies,
sell items to townsfolk and trade items with monsters in the dungeon. There
is plenty of testing and balancing still to do here. You should be able to
bribe monsters in the dungeon to have them progressively become less likely
to kill you and more friendly by trading at a loss. However, such monsters
will usually turn on you or leave you if you don't continue to pay them (You
will be warned in advance of this happening). Be especially wary of dealing
with evil monsters although they tend to offer much better deals up front.
There are several functions left to do here: a monster still needs to be able
to 'prematurely drop' in order that it has a more interesting set of items
to trade with you, and they need to be able to reveal the part of the dungeon
where they live, so you can go there for any moneys they haven't paid you
yet.

- Allow all stores now buy books, statues.

- Library no longer stocks services based on the books it owns.

- Use a fake Blessed Weapon tval to indicate that the store can buy any
weapon if it is blessed. Might change this to a flag at a later date.

- Beginners are no longer beginners after reaching level 10.

- Improve access to help files during character creation.

- Add some additional help and tips.

- Make monsters less aggressive if they are woken up.

- Adjust magic book rarity.

- Allow raising of dead familiars.

- Tattoos no longer trigger icky hands (Suggested by Derakon).

- Remove prerequisites from detect power (Suggested by thorgot) and add them
to detect magic instead.

- Finish rogue class changes.

- Split mage spell books up to reduce the total number of spells in each book
for balance purposes. Schools now have 5 books per school (except semi-schools
TBD) and each specialist book has been split into a low and high version of
that book.

- Reduce radius of Wizard Light spell (Suggested by Derakon).

- The East Road and Brandywine Ferry are now directly connected after the
Dunlending Agent is killed (Suggested by Derakon).

- Allow player to throw objects accurately at short range.

- Make walls of fire much less common in rooms.

- Make earlier levels more Angband-like.

- Rename nest to burrows.

- Add ambrosia.

- Give starting sorcerors a more viable spell selection.

- Add three new room types: cellular cave, burrows and polygonal rooms.

Barrow-wight.

- Improve access to help files during character creation.

- Add some additional help and tips.

- Add display of primary and secondary stats while picking class during
character generation.

inventories of the targetted monster. Needs testing.

- Examining a book now details the services it allows a shopkeeper to provide.

dungeon.

completely.

to ebizzell for test case).


### Build / Platform ###

- Adopt PostMessage replacement in main-win.c from Vanilla (Thanks to zaimoni
for suggestion).

- It is now possible in most places in the edit files to specify tval by name
instead of number. Currently only the store.txt file does so, and it does this
to specify items that can be bought in the stores. This is no longer hard coded.

- Use a fake Blessed Weapon tval to indicate that the store can buy any
weapon if it is blessed. Might change this to a flag at a later date.

- Move to safer use of project_one instead of project_o etc.

- Updated main-gcu from Vanilla (Thanks to d_m for the suggestion).

- It is now possible to restrict vaults to particular level themes. Use this
primarily for vaults which are 'corridor-like' to avoid affecting the likelihood
of larger vaults appearing.

### Build / Platform ###

- Rowan Beentje (Lebannen): Significant updates to the Mac OS/X platform as well as some general platform updates.

- Significant rewrites of the projection and blows code.

- Remove another set of case statements: this time for describing item effects.

- A number of improvements to dungeon generation to allow map designers to improve specific dungeon designs. You can now create 'special' levels of various types, and use level and special room flags as a part of the dungeon zone set up. This allows a lot more granular control of dungeon architecture and special scenarios.

- In addition, added ability to have Mario style hidden access to dungeons. Note Gandalf taking one such route in his fight with the Balrog.

- Update class and race code to use new skills array.

- Make mushrooms tval 79. This simplifies code all over the place.

- Implement ability to regenerate the last dungeon level as per Bug #15115. Because this uses the simple random number generator, you have to switch this capability on explicitly.

Wizard command S specifies a dungeon seed. If dungeon seed is not zero, we generate levels using the simple random number generator and store the last seed used.

Wizard command L will then regenerate the last level using the last level dungeon seed.

Let me know if you need the ability to see what the seed and last seed currently are, or modify the last seed in any way.

- Switch over to using 'modern' Angband timed effects on the character.

- Player spell and ranged attacks now use the new do_cmd_item interface.

- Darke: Dumps out html files of various lib/edit/ text files; needs to be run from the 'root' unangband directory

- Create some more safety hatches for infinite loops in dungeon generation.

- Start describing monster blows using edit file code.

- Exclude html dumps from user directory in svn.

- Remove warning when ALLOW_TEMPLATES code is disabled.

- Moved much summoning code to edit files.

- Move breath damage and attack power details into data files.

- Add some diagnostic code for stacking problems. Add a save file fix to try to address the same.

Unangband 0.6.2 Beta Release 2: "Help of the shopkeepers"

### Game Play ###

* made nexus temporary (via temporary stat bonuses)

* fixed #12919 (Flask and wand of Nexus do not (un)scramble stats)

* removed potions of Slow Poison

no other class gets icky hands for anything else than magic books use. 
Instruments are underused anyway.

* made wands of Spark less common outside Hobbiton

* made resting for the night more expensive --- vampires are not liked

* made Ranger's cache more lucrative

related to objects

* a hack to move Black willow deeper (paralyze spell); it's now at DL7, 
it it's not enough, make paralyzation even shorter for shallow monsters

* made ecologies start at DL3 so that both Maggot's and Isengard start with 
all the fun; only Bree has first 2 levels weird

* an experiment with limiting powerleveling for low-level characters; 
this count ers higher amount of OoD monsters after my previous changes; 
this does not affect XP from in-depth monsters; it almost does not affect 
CL30 and older characters

lots of XP

* described Black willow in more detail to help players

* fixed inactive Rod of Slow Monsters

(e.g. Phase Door distance)

* now saving store generation level, this now really fixes #10307 
(restocking of the black market, thanks to kajmace's persistence)

* a fix to message saving; if your messages get garbled upon version change, 
don't be alarmed --- it's a one-time annoyance

* fixed a lots of object generation quirks; not sure what I'm doing; 
no more negative pval objects in shops; but I'd prefer that there remain 
a few with sane maluses

* fixed 13138 (Can't use staff in hand)

* remove spurious flags in spells such as the one invoked by eating mushroom of 
Blindness

* made mushrooms of Mana blue again

* a quick hack to remove broken egos from quest reward shops

* fixed #13328 (Guaranteed good and great items still get negative pvals)

* unfortunately the quadratic pval costs make cheaper flags much more common, 
because more expensive stuff can't get into the 19/20 of the expected power; 
reduced this to 18/20, but still... for the same reason non-pval flags 
are very rare --- they can't fine tune to 18/20 by pvals or, deep down, 
get high enough by pvals (in magic items, randarts cope)

* removed/redone some of my tweaks from last month, when I still didn't 
understand the code

* fixed a crash in homes knowledge screen

* fixed the Wall of Fire crash reported by Big Al

* fixed bag refusing mashrooms

### Build / Platform ###

* silenced mingw warnings

- Allow OS/X to compile again due to changes in use_sound introduced 
in the Angband porting work. This will undoubtedly break the OS/X menus.

- Workaround for Bug #13249 ] Crash on exit with show_itemlist on Windows.


Unangband 0.6.2 Beta Release

### Game Play ###

- Wall of stone, earthquake and other effects that entomb monsters do not automatically
destroy non-living monsters, making them slightly less abusable.

- If you learnt something about a flavored object, you will continue to remember it for
all instances of that object type.

- Implemented quivers from NPPAngband code.

- Made mimics drop objects relating to their graphic. Chest and bag mimics now drop items
similar to opening a chest.

- Temporary elemental resistance now gives additional protection against appropriate terrain
effects: you must have more than temporary fire resistance to resist steam, lava, boiling mud
and boiling water however.  Also resistance on boots provides equivalent protection, except
where the terrain is completely filled (e.g underwater).  Note waves, eruptions, spreading 
clouds and other dangers will still splash and damage you from adjacent locations so that you
will not be completely immune to damage on this terrain.

- Added items of resist water.

- Made lite and regeneration pval-dependent and cumulative.  Regeneration now comes in two
flavours - hit point and mana regeneration.  Amulets of regeneration provide both and
various ego-objects and (especially) artifacts will usually benefit one or the other,
sometimes greatly.

- Made basic resists (acid, fire, cold, electricity) as well as resist poison and resist
water incremental, with a geometric progression. Wearing 1 permanent resistance item
gives you 1/2 resistance, wearing 2 gives you 1/3 resistance etc.  Temporary resistance
counts as wearing 3 additional items but only for protecting you from damage, not your
equipment.  Because cumulative resistance also protects your equipment, wearing e.g.
two items of acid resistance will completely prevent equipment destruction for any 
individual attack that does 30 hp or less resistance.  Now wearing two items is the
equivalent of the old 'elemental resistance' bonus, but to get the equivalent of the
old double-resist bonus, you have to wear 6 items + have temporary resistance.  This
should make dangerous elemental breathers suitable threatening again.  Of course, immunity
provide complete protection as always.

- Added a new stat: agility. Agility modifies base movement speed and increases armour class.
Agility now also provides protection against theft instead of dexterity.  Currently no items
modify agility directly.  (Significant contributions to code by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Made speed rarer to compensate (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Reorganised existing stat modifiers to make other stats more useful for warriors.
Intelligence now modifies to hit bonus, instead of strength, and greatly increases chance of
critical blows and shots.  Dexterity now has more of an impact on to-hit bonus, and no longer
modifies armour class.  Wisdom now greatly modifies armour class.  Charisma decreases the
chance of monsters using ranged attacks against you (taunting) and increases the chance of
monsters fleeing after sustaining damage (intimidating).

- Modified enchantment and item power evaluation.  It is now no longer possible to enchant
weapon damage greater than damage dice * damage sides + 5, instead of the old value of 15.
It is now now longer possible to enchant armour bonus greater than armour class + 5, instead
of the old value of 15.

- All to-hit bonuses are now only 2/3rds effective as before for hitting an enemy.  This makes
base skill more important (similar to Oangband style combat) however it is easier in Unangband
to get additional to-hit bonuses from styles and attributes.

- The to-dam bonus from strength and items can not exceed damage dice * damage sides + 5 of
the wielded weapon (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Significant rewrite and rebalancing of styles and starting equipment  (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Seperated out throwing as a separate skill and made some races (e.g. Hobbits, Half-Trolls)
significantly better at throwing than bows.  Balanced throwing as an ability.  Intelligence
now makes throwing weapons less likely to break.  Larger throwing weapons will be damaged
instead of being destroyed by breakage. (Mikolaj Konarski).

- If you throw a weapon from your wielded slot and have multiple throws, you can select
multiple targets to hit (Trick Shot).  Selecting yourself as a target will allow the weapon
to return to your wielded slot. You may accidentally injure yourself if you attempt this,
agility helps to avoid this (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Combined Perception and Searching skills, now named Searching. (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Fleeing monsters no longer wake allies. Allies only wake each other if they are nearby or
within line of fire (Suggested by Matthias Rudolf).

- Dwarves now get an intelligence bonus instead of penalty.

- Attacking a fleeing monster will make them alert their allies if they recover their courage.

- Killing a monster will alert their allies, if one of them is awake to see it.

- Monster level and rarity now set by algorithm as opposed to manually.

- Levels now will only spawn a limit different types of monsters. If you want to encounter a 
different range of monsters, you need to travel to a new level.

- Rooms descriptions will now be based on the most powerful monster on the level.

- The dungeon generator will now create a lot less rooms on a level and will work much harder
to ensure that all rooms are correctly connected.

- Corridors will now be generated according to the appropriate level 'theme'.

- Room descriptions now properly place items and features around the room as described.

- More items than food can be eaten under the right circumstances.

- Added new class Warrior Mage, which has good combat abilities and magic equivalent to the
old Ranger.  Rangers now only cast spells (approximately) as well as rogues.

- Added priests who specialise in magic books, which allows the priest to cast spells from
one magic book as per a non-specialist mage. Added Gifted and Chosen Warriors, Archers and
Thieves who can choose from a single magic book or prayer book spells. Added Cultists who
are mages with access to one prayer book and renamed old Shaman Cultists to Druids.

- Renamed Rogues to Artisans. Swapped Ranger and Artisan stealth.

- Added 'Artisan' and 'Ranger' magic books, so that these two classes can get their entire
spell selection in 6 books.

- You now don't gain a stat increase every level, but gain multiple stat increases instead
periodically. However, when increasing multiple stats, you can only increase each stat once
per level gain. This prevents you maximising key stats too early and makes high starting
stats more useful.

- Improvements to costs when assigning attributes using the point assignment method at birth.
This now mimics the distribution of stats using the auto-roller a lot more (Analysis by
mikon).

- Added magic resistance to a number of monsters, in particular demons and Maia. Magic
resistance means that a monster has a percentage chance of completely ignoring an attack
from a magical source (spell, scroll, rod, staff, wand or activated item). Activations that
apply with the blow of an activated item ignore magic resistance, as weapon coatings and
effects from thrown potions, flasks and food. Magic resistance also applies to the
appropriate effects if an item is set in a trap. Magic resistance protects a monster against
spells wielded as weapons.

- Demons are also immune to damage from more elemental effects.

- Added heavy armoured coats that wield into the Cloak slot. This allows players to easily
increase their armour early on, at the cost of additional encumberance.

- Added starburst rooms, fractal rooms from NPPAngband, streamer code and room distribution
code from Sangband (modified somewhat).

- Changed to NPP-style lakes and rivers.

- Removed hack that prevented more than 1 town worth of stores being kept in memory. All the
stores you have visited will now keep their inventory between visits, being maintained and
shuffled normally.

- Stats now can be increased above 18/100 through level increases (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Rebalancing of stats, stat progression and stat tables (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Added a number of additional spells wielded as weapons, armour and amulets.  These are
mostly available in Animal Magic and Transformation magic books.

- Use Sangband stair placement algorithm.

- Disabled ecologies on very early levels as this made them too boring. Increased the 
minimum size of an ecology.

- In order to provide a greater range of monsters, scale up the power of some low level
monsters as they appear deeper in the dungeon.

- In order to make different level types more interesting, boosted various types of
things placed, depending on the level: strongholds and sewers have more monsters, crypts
and strongholds have more traps, mines have more treasures, caves, crypts and mines have
more rubble, crypts have more objects appearing in corridors and strongholds have more
objects appearing in rooms. Also made the tunnel types more interesting for each level
type.

- Electricity no longer destroys items. Instead it will affect rods, staffs and wands with
the same percentage chances, however draining them instead of destroying them. Rods will
be set to a high timeout value instead.

- Added a large number of additional races, including from FAAngband and Oangband. Some
races have the ability to shape change into other shapes (e.g. Beorning, Vampire, Werewolf,
Maia). Added support for innate racial activations.

- Teleport level attacks now affect the terrain under you, which either drops you a level
or launches you up a level. This gives you a chance to evade the attack by moving.

- Activating spell objects or innate abilities now tires you out.

- Monsters when blinded now have a better selection of spells to cast.

- Resist disease now completely protects against diseases from disease attacks. Constitution
provides significant reduction in disease effects (Requested by Matthias Rudolf).

enters the level (Requested by Matthias Rudolf).

- Tree-filled caverns are placed better in the dungeon.

- Prevent flooding of open ground.

- Added some low level priest spells and defined some pre-requisites for basic priest
spells.

- You now dodge towards any monster you are attacking, which means ranged attacks can hit
them instead, and that you can charge in the opposite direction the following turn.

- Blocking now last two turns.

- Added alchemical formulas. These allow potion specialists to inscribe a formula on a
potion, scroll or lite object to modify how the object explodes. e.g. =1l causes any 
explosion to lite up the area it affects. =3r makes potion have radius 3. =2d makes potion
do double damage. There are currently 15 different letters for you to discover, which can 
be combined. e.g. =3r2d.

- Added a comprehensive set of death messages for various types of self-inflicted and
unusual deaths.

- You can now damage yourself with bolt and (more importantly) ball spells.

- Thrown potions now explode with a fake 'nothing' effect if they have no effect 
(Suggested by Mikolaj).

- Updated to allow radius 2 monster lites, improved glowing terrain and dropping a lit light to
allow it to lite up the surroundings.

- No ice-themed dungeons at shallow depth (Reported by Pete Mac). In general, dungeon
features should be chosen a little more appropriately regards for depth.

- Food descriptions improved (Reported by Pete Mac).

- Dungeon connectivity should be greatly improved (Reported by Pete Mac and others).

- Made staffs brandable (Requested by jevansau1).

- Update todo.txt to include conversations with monsters ideas.

- Diseases no longer prevent healing (again), except where the disease drains health.

- Added change shape spells.

- Added summoning spells of various kinds that allow you to summon monsters to fight on your side.
You earn experience from their kills. At the moment, you cannot give monsters any orders, and must
maintain the enemies you wish them to attack in line of sight or sensed via telepathy or various
monster sensing (Detect spells don't qualify). A number of intended improvements are outstanding
but feedback is welcome (Requested by jevansau1).

- Added charm monster spells of various kinds.

- Player traps created by spells now earns the player experience points, and has a limited number of
charges (based on level). Other terrain created by the player times out relatively quickly.

- Added schools of magic. A school determines your starting spellbook (currently only for mages
and mage type casters), and which of your class spellbooks are stocked in town shops. There are
currently 7 schools of magic, each with their own 4 basic books, and related higher level books.
Note that a few spells are not currently implemented, and some higher level books are currently
empty of spells. Priest schools will also be developed, possibly to reflect the different Middle
Earth deities, plus a paladin school.

- The unique elementals now get escorts of their ilk.

- Spores can now be stored in the quiver (Thanks to Mikolaj Konarski for the suggestion and
code for this).

- Reworked campaign mode so that you can almost always travel back and forward between two
locations.  Added some additional locations.  This is very much a work in progress and will need
balancing to ensure there are dungeons that can be accessed easily to cover all depths.

- Monsters in groups are now lead by a higher level leader. Add ability for monsters to vary by
age.

- Undead now live with undead animals. Animal summoners summon undead animals if they are undead.

- Added low level wands of Spark and re-organised wand depths and prices slightly.

- Blessing is now the first paladin spell to help low level paladins with combat.

- Made men of Bree observant and Haradrim warriors fearless.

- If a summoned minion of yours dies, you incure a mana debt equal to the monster level. If you
cannnot pay the debt from available mana, you'll pay it in blood instead.

- Monsters you summon now have a time limit to their existence.

- If the deepest monster on a level is powerful, litter the level with the remains of its victims.

- Morgoth is now an equal oppotunity employer.

- Try to ensure monster drops 1 weapon, 1 body armour, 1 helmet etc. when calculating monster
drops to provide a better as well as more realistic set of drops.

- Implemented the remaining spells in the player spell lists. Add and update a few spells borrowed from Sangband.

- Druidic monsters now regenerate mana from water and health from living terrain.

- You get additional blows with your weapon while charging: one if you'd
normally get three blows, two if you'd normally get five, and so on.
Only the first blow gets the charging bonus, but all are effective
against huge monsters.

- Huge monsters can now be easily attacked if you are standing on
rubble, trees, vents and other terrain that requires two turns to
climb onto.

- Allow player to select sneaking using the hash key. This currently only prevents
his allies from attacking 'unaware' monsters.

- Prevent allies eating too much while they fight.

- Archers now share ammunition between themselves to ensure that the majority of the
group has ammunition.

- At the Battle of Five Armies, you should now be accompanied by allied troops. This should
make battlefield locations more interesting to fight in; a further revision will occur next
version.

- Invisible monsters now 'dance' around the player in melee to avoid being too easily
guessable as to where they are.

- Revert to old inaccessible Hobbiton layout. In general, you won't run into any high level
uniques in towns, like you used to, until certain key conditions have been met. Similarly,
there are very few dungeon uniques you are required to fight. Certain events have much
more wide-ranging consequences - hopefully the room descriptions will provide enough of
a warning.

- Allow food / wands / staffs / rods and some rings to appear in piles.

- Decrease the relative frequency of drops of items that appear in piles.

- Allow crowns to appear in the dungeon with a much higher bonuses.

- Armour appears in the dungeon with better bonuses.

- Decrease overall frequency of wands.

- Added 'sub-ecologies' which are collections of rooms which share a common part of the
monster ecology.

- Made slowdown at negative speeds smaller. As before, -10 to speed makes normal monsters
twice as fast as you are, but no longer -7 does (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Only restock and shuffle shops of the home town, to prevent shopping scumming
 (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Beefed up HAFTED a little bit for priests --- with free constant Bless it was too weak
an advantage (Mikolaj Konarski).

- Make Smeagol a more interesting opponent.

- There's no point having monsters that cast invisible never be seen - they may as well just
have INVISIBLE flag. Likewise for blessed etc.

- Significant bug-fixes and improvements to the dungeon generation code to the point where
its pretty much feature complete. "I've just played current V (Farm dungeon) and the dungeon
generation is so much better after your recent work. Rooms, tunnels and even monsters are much
more interesting and not just random, but with a nontrivial pattern that you start to grasp
after several levels."

- You can now use the run command to 'step' into an adjacent monster, instead of attacking
it.

- Vampires/inns allow rest until dusk/dawn.

- Service of Healing now available at the temple.

- You no longer have to be full to travel.

- The player only suffers a monster disease if the monster disease state isn't upgraded. This
gives them some grace e.g. preventing small chance of paralysis on the first blow.

- Disease monsters now afflict you with the disease effects straight away.

- Different approach to applying disease effects. They now only hit you when you enter a level,
unless a quick disease (which retains the old process).

- Added ecologies based on monster name and dragon breaths.

- If you have a torch or weapon with a known fire brand wielded, you can use this to light the terrain directly under you, using the | command.

- Added 'dungeon chicken'.

- Tweaked Bree so that it's doable in one go without WOR, made Bill Fenry and a pair of similar uniques bit weaker  (Mikolaj Konarski)

- Give druids another spell at 3rd level. They didn't have enough of a choice otherwise.

- Every dungeon guardian creates a stairwell at death.

- Allow torches to be taken from walls.

- Scale dragon armour breath based on player current hit points.

- Overhaul dungeon connections and progression, and included a map of northern Middle Earth to add in early
game progress, accessible via the help menu (Thanks to Mikolaj Konarski for putting a huge amount
of work into this).

- Add guardian for early Isengard.

- Added an Ent Moot.

- Made a low-level Caradhras location (the Redhorn) that provides access to Mirkwood once the surface guardian is defeated.

- Made the siege of Hornburg inescapable.

- Add a few monsters from ToME - some with modifications.

- Made potions of stats even more common.

- Made bard class slightly more powerful.

- Allow Chill to be used on any enemy in line of sight.

- Your allies will not breath or cast ball spells if it will hit you.

- Allies drop the objects they are carrying when they leave your service.

- If the player is blocking, he gets a +20 to hit in melee and +15 to hit with bows/throwing. This allows bad melee practitioners to increase their odds of hitting by blocking.

- If the weapon you are attacking with or the ammo you are firing / item you are throwing is not an ego item, artifact, coated weapon or magic item, it will inherit brands/slays from your equipment as follows:

* In melee, your gloves/gauntlets are checked first.
* If you have no gauntlets, instead, your right hand ring.
* Except for blows with your secondary weapon, which use your left-hand ring.
* For throws and ammunition, only your left hand ring is checked.

- Rings of ice/acid/fire/electricity now have the appropriate brand. This makes them highly useful for archers/throwing specialists as well as mage-type spell casters which do not use gloves/gauntlets.

- Modified low-level bard spells, replacing Holy Water with a more bard specific spell.

- Added spells that modify a single round of blows, shooting or throwing.

- Scale down upper end of monster drop sizes.

- Minimise number of townsfolk who drop gold.

- various changes and additions to the wilderness map, guardians, depths; in particular, added the Great Grey Wolf and a slight upgrade to Boldog, the Orc Captain, to have missile attack.

- substituted guardians (e.g. Black Riders) now guard only the first zone and are described as such

- recycled some guardians so that changes to the world, as the game progresses, do not make uniques undefeatable, except a few plot-motivated cases

- ad hoc tweaks to pseudo-id (until this is rethought and rewritten more systematically), in particular, broken items are no longer reported {average} for mages;

- on shallow levels, OOD monster rarer and not so OOD

- moved multiplying monsters (especially shallow but high HP ones) much deeper by increasing their hp rating in the power calculations; giant black louse is thus level 6, not 3 as before (is 7 in monster.txt)

- removed restore potions, made stat potions much more common and cheaper, tweaked prices of starting magic devices

- made traps, potions, etc. that do more than p_ptr->mph/2 damage leave player at 1HP instead of killing him; please revert if this is too munchkinish, but note that it only affects early game, when detect traps and ID are scarce; with this also later in the game test-id and no-trap-detection become viable; tentative

- made apple and berries a bit lighter and berries somewhat nourishing

- you can now die from starvation second turn after travel, beware

- other minor tweaks and additions

* Made most deep dungeons shallower now that you cannot WOR to bottom; cannot make Angband shallower, I guess, or no-campaign mode will break

* You can never be permanently stat drained now.

* Made the number of quest rewards slightly random

- You can also no longer try to cast with insufficient mana if you are at 3 CON.

- You can now inscribe anything edible with =< to eat one of them when you travel.
Normal food will automatically be eaten, but you can inscribe it with !< to not do so.

* Visiting surface now does not count for player max depth --- easier to keep track of current character power (or risk aversion)

* ?oID wasn't common enough now that you have only 1 town

* Removed armor encumberance by 3rd ring or off-hand weapon --- a mage is now better off with an off-hand dagger than a shield

* Move the Maggot's dogs to DL3 now that they only appear at one level

### User Interface ###

Unangband 0.6.1 "It's all in the reflexes." aka "Hell of the Upside-down
Sinners"

### Game Play ###

- Improved metric for when monsters should cast probe spell (Reported by
Bandobras).

- Changed object value calculation to be based on object power.

- A race and class-based pseudo-identify on creation of an item. This will
distinguish whether an item is {average} or not and provide some 'additional'
information, depending on the race and class of the character.

- You can now coat your sharp weapons, arrows and bolts with potions,
mushrooms or flasks of oil in order to do additional damage from the effects
of these items. This does 20% of the damager per blow or shot that throwing
the equivalent potion, flask or mushroom does.

- Added higher level dangerous potions and flasks to allow improved weapon
coatings.

- Magic items start being generated earlier in the game but are less powerful
deeper in the dungeon.

- You can now switch your torch or lantern on and off using the | key.

- Added a variety of magical bags which can hold large numbers of objects at
a constant weight. Each magical bag can only fit certain types of objects inside
it.

- You can inscribe an artifact weapon with '=A' to automatically activate it
against the creature you are attacking or throwing the weapon against.  This
causes the activation to affect the target creature only, and discharges the
artifact as per normal.

- Added spells and scrolls of various kinds of mana recovery.

- Added ego and magic lanterns.

- Monsters now eat bodies around the dungeon if they are hungry and not under
attack.

- Improved utility of low powered detection spells. Added Sense Magic scrolls.
(From Sangband).

- Added additional effects: Petrify which prevents you from moving and event-
ually paralyzes you, which requires resist shards to resist; Stastis which
prevents you from acting, but protects you from any attacks; Dispel which
removes all enchantments from you and monsters; Sleep which causes you to
become drowsy and then fall asleep, preventing you from acting and making you
blind, but removed if you take any damage.

- You can now sleep to recover damaged stats. This takes quite a while.

- Instead of trailing webs around the dungeon, spiders now are generated in
spider webs. Acidic monsters and other monster types now generate trails around
the dungeon.

- Chasms can now be bridged by destructable bridges; you can now use rope and
chain with spikes in order to build bridges across chasms.

- Water and other terrain and suffocation/drowning effects no longer confuse
to allow player and monsters to have a better chance to find their way out of
such terrain.

- Added potions of free action, more high-level wands, ropes and grappling
ammunition to shoot ropes across chasms.

- Added a number of new attack spells using winds, blood, webs and other new
effects, as well as nexus, ice and darkness.

- Added saleable paintings.

- Improve low level great drops in particular drops from the Dunlending agent
(Reported by Mikon).

- Object detection now detects mimic monsters. Treasure detection now detects
monsters made of coins or gems, or coin or gem-like monsters.

- Burning arrows replaced by oil-coated regular arrows.

- Some new weapons and armour re-balancing from Sangband.

- Made cumulative effects of confusion and stun on monsters dependent on their
level.

- Made monster saving throws again slow, blindness, confusion etc more variable.

- Potions, flasks and spores will always explode when thrown as if hitting a 
monster. They will also explode when on the floor and destroyed by an attack. 
This allows much more tactical diversity when using them (Requested by mikon).

- Haggling and auto-scum are now birth rather than game-play options.

- Separated out maximise modes for race and class. Class now defaults to off
(Half-maximise mode).

- Allow staffs to be used while wielding them (Requested by ekolis).

- Detect magic now detects magical monsters. Detect water now detects watery monsters.
Detect life now detects living terrain.

- Cure fear effects from potions of boldness, heroism and beserk strength now cure
petrification as well (Requested by Pete Mac).

- Store services no longer count towards total store stock levels.

- Added HURT_LITE to Black Rider at Weathertop (Suggested by Pete Mack).

- Added extra spells to Smaug (From Oangband).

- Added ranged attack to Bert, Bill, Tom (Suggested by Pete Mack).

- Store selling oil and lanterns is now available from Rivendell (Suggested by
Pete Mack).

- A number of spells now have prerequisite spells that you must learn first before
studying them.

- Rebalance and expand the mage spell list considerably.

- Damage from cloud, storm and area spells do not decrease with distance from the
centre of effect.

- Removed the ability of low level spell caster monsters to bash doors; particularly
those short of stature (Suggested by Pete Mac).

- Removed the ability of skeletons, zombies, dragons and hydras to open doors: they may
still bash them however. Some other monsters may bash but not open doors now; or open
but not bash doors.

- Changed what attributes govern number of spells learnt, mana and fail rates: for
mages, rangers, rogues and shamans, intelligence now controls number of spells learnt,
wisdom now controls amount of mana and dexterity now controls spell failure rates.
This is the same for priests and paladins, except they use charisma to determine
spell failure rates. Bards use dexterity to determine number of spells learnt, charisma
to determine mana and constitution to determine spell failure rates.
This is configurable in p_class.txt for those who want to revert to the old system.

- Changed stat progression so that 'about' one spell is learnt per level except for
very high spell stats. Made individual stat increases have more impact on total spells
known, especially at higher stat levels. Very low stats are better at remembering a few
spells.

- Whenever you learn a new spell, you now get a study item created in your inventory,
depending on the type of spell book. This study item can be used to study spells not
available in your current spell book; as well as allowing you to cast the spell you
have just studied. This makes learning spells from features in the dungeon now useful.
Be careful not to lose this study item however, as it is (currently) irreplaceable.

- Chests are now themed and drop more useful and powerful items or valuable gold. Low
level chests are less frequently trapped, high-level ones more so (Suggested by Adam
Horowitz).

- Monsters with good or great drops now drop more valuable gold or gems if they have
a gold drop.

- Some monsters are now telepathic and will not say anything out loud about the player.

- You now choose which stat you increase every level.

- Smoother progression gaining spells and mana.

- For computing slays and brands, if the value on the damage dice roll is less than
3, treat it as 3 for determining the damage added by the slay or brand only. e.g. for
x3 multiplier weapons, add at least 6 damage, x4 multiplier weapons, add at least 9
damage, and x5 multiplier weapons, add at least 12 damage. We deliberately ignore
this when computing weapon or artifact power for the moment to keep thing simplier (it
will only add a point or two to power in most instances anyway).

- Tweaked monster AI for situations involving pillar dancing, hack'n'back and splash
damage exploits. Also ensure teleport to and teleport self to are used more sensibly.

- Monsters now talk to allies who are out of sight but nearby. Also monsters now
verbally as opposed to telepathically communicate when they find a scent.

- Made parasites hatch.

- Added some more cure disease items and magic.

- Increased stone troll boulder damage. Modified lemures.

- Gloves of intelligence and wisdom no longer affect mage type casters (Suggested by
Adam Horowitz).

- To encourage the use of swap weapons and armour, these types of items will just be
damaged, as opposed to destroyed, whilst in the backpack and affected by an inventory
damaging elemental attack. Diggers are now vulnerible to damage whilst in the backpack.

- Adjusted bag rarities and depths to try to make early bags more useful and interesting
and deeper bags not necessarily encountered every game (Suggested by Matthias Rudolf).

- Adjusted diseases to make heavy and powerful diseases more distinct, and to improve
'correctness' of disease life-cycle in instances where a disease was draining hitpoints
mana or experience or preventing them from healing only.

- Study items are now only created when you study at a feature.

- Scaled down the costs of high stats when using point based character generation due
to stat gain at every level (Suggested by mikon).

- Priests can now specialise in priest books or instruments (Suggested by mikon).

- Magic items are half as common as before, but great non-magical items are now
much more frequent.

- Allow diggers to be branded (Requested by ekolis).

- Changed how inventory damage from elemental attacks works. Each vulnerible item in
your inventory now has a 1% chance plus 1% per 15 hit points of elemental damage
suffered of being destroyed when you are hit by an elemental attack. Resistance
granted by an item (but not a spell) halves this chance, rounded down. This means
you become immune to inventory damage from blows causing less than 15 hit points
damage if you wear an item that grants elemental resistance. However the percentage
increase from high damage attacks is not limited - any attack causing 30 or more
damage (or 60 damage resisted) is now more likely to destroy items in your inventory
than previously.

- Some nasty acidic monsters have had their blows modified so they are more likely
to cause high hit point damage attacks, but have reduced blows to compensate. 

- Acid can now reduce ac multiple levels in a single hit (equivalent to inventory
damage) and destroy worn items that do not have additional magical properties.

- Reduce size of deep object piles (Suggested by Matthias Rudolf).

- Change progression of healing potions so that Healing and *Healing* and Life do
not appear as early, as Cure Mortal Wounds is available.

- Reduced level at which many objects qualify as good drops so that e.g. *Identify*
is now considered a good drop.

- It is now possible to improve an object with runes, and subsequently brand
it, provided there are no 'left-over' runes. If there is, these runes are lost
when the item is branded. However, an object cannot be branded, then subsequently
improved with runes.

- Confusion no longer prevents you from casting spells. It also only takes effect
sometimes at 'low' levels of confusion. Similar effects apply for monsters affected
by confusion.

- Being berserk prevents you from casting spells, using wands, staffs or rods, or
archery or thrown weapons. Berserk monsters lose the ability to make ranged attacks.

- You can now douse your lights to walk through water (Requested by darkDrone).

- Stop dungeons flooding with deep water.

- Monsters that are hiding and wish to use a ranged attack or spell now take a turn
to unhide and will use the ability the following turn (Requested by Matthias Rudolf).

- You can now sell statues to temples. Stores will not stock statues once sold as they
are only good for making money for the player through sale.

- Reduced the power of the King of the Wood Elves to about 80% of his former strength
(Requested by Pete Mac). Also modified the depth of some of his more powerful escorts
so that they won't usually appear with him.

- Upgraded and added more staffs of Cure x Wounds, and potions of Cure Moderate Wounds.
Cure Serious Wounds effect from priest spell or potion or staff now only partially cures
confusion and stun. Increased depth of Cure Serious Wounds and Cure Critical Wounds
potions and made Cure Moderate Wounds potions appear at the old Cure Serious Wounds depth
and frequency in stores. Since Cure Moderate Wounds in Unangband is equivalent to old
Cure Serious Wounds from Angband, this shouldn't have too much of an impact, except for
curing confusion (which is now less dangerous to the player initially).

- Changed pricing formula for objects so that more powerful objects become progressively
worth more.

- Added double-brand ego weapons with drawbacks.

- Wielding a weapon or digger less than 20 lbs, or a bow or sling, but not crossbow,
only take half a turn.

- Added scrolls, spells and services of test magic. These identify magic items and
detect one ability of ego items or artifacts (Suggested by Matthias Rudolf).

- Added Legend Lore as a store service and spell.

- Improved semantics of becoming 'aware' of objects, particularly with reference to
the bard's sense magic ability.

- Prevent objects dropping on terrain that would destroy them.

- Spear-type polearms only every cause additional critical damage. Axe-type polearms
including halberds will either stun or cut an opponent. Scythes only cut an opponent.

- Added charging. If you move and then immediately attack in the same direction, or
to a 45 degree adjacent direction, you will charge instead of conduct a normal attack.
Charging results in you making a single attack (or two attacks, if you are wielding two
weapons), instead of your usual number of blows. However, if the weapon weighs 6.6 or
more pounds, all damage you would normally do is multiplied by the weight in lbs of
the weapon divided by 3.3 lbs. e.g. 6.6 lbs does double damage, 9.9 does triple, etc.
  Be aware that you always charge now, so that weapons with high blows and low weight
are less effective when you close to attack an opponent, unless they end up more than
45 degrees away from the direction of your move.  In general, if you get more blows
than the weapon charge multiplier, it is probably worth waiting for the monsters to
come to you.
  If you are fighting unarmed, you use your weight divided by 33 lbs instead for the
damage multiplier to deliver a flying kick.  Charging also doubles the 'power' of your
bashes against terrain, so a door that you cannot force might be defeatable with a run
up. Note that spear-type polearms are the most effective at charging as their critical
damage will also be increased by charging.
  A new combat tactic might be to select a heavy weapon, use it to charge an opponent,
and then switch to a lighter weapon (taking a half-move to do so), and take advantage
of the additional attacks the lighter weapon affords.
  Note the figure of 3.3 lbs is class dependent - it is this value for warriors and
paladins, 4.4 lbs for priests, archers and thieves, 5.5 lbs for bards and rangers and
6.6 lbs for mages and shamans.

- Massively reduce the power of the guardian of Caradhras. Rebalance unique depths.
Swap stats of Baldor the Hapless and Lord of the Paths of the Dead.

- Huge monsters are hard to melee except from charging attacks, attacks against them
missing approximately 60% of the time.  In order to effectively melee a huge monster,
you need to step back after every attack and charge it again.  Made more monsters huge.

- Complete rebalancing of monsters from level 5 to level 35.

- Added additional wood elves to try to make Mirkwood more interesting.  Made Brass
Monkeys less common.

- Evasive monsters can now dodge bolt and beam spells (From Eyangband).

- Monsters spawn more frequently deeper in the dungeon. Stealth now affects spawning
rate, and can result in monsters being spawned asleep (From SAngband).

- Made disease effects against monsters a lot more interesting.

- Enabled throwing again. Throwing now includes damage from specialisation if the
object you are throwing has the THROWING flag.  Such objects also get twice the
benefit of their to-hit and damage bonuses when thrown.  If you have an instrument or
no bow equipped, you are still capable of throwing using the fire command, and this
command will only list items with the THROWING flag enabled.

- Player traps now do additional damage from coated weapons and ammunition.

- You can now damage monster inventories. This is primarily intended for destroying
monster ammunition with fire or acid based spells, but stolen objects will equally 
be at risk of destruction.

- Moria has been broken into several parts with multiple paths and guardians.

- Monsters will now use healing potions if they carry them, particularly to cure
blindness. Monsters that are blinded are able to use cure spells (only) to heal
themselves.

- You only trigger traps on chests when you attempt to open them now, as opposed
to just stepping on them (Requested by Matthias Rudolf).

- You can now travel to any accessible location that you could travel to, not just
'nearby' locations, however distant trips will take longer and leave you hungrier.

- Temporary speed causes you to tire out quickly (Requested by mikon).

- There is now a place to store valuables while you are exploring the Paths of the
Dead (Requested by Matthias Rudolf).

- Slimy floors and wet floors and walls as well as ice provide no purchase for
climbing monsters.

- Aggravation now only wakes monsters in line of sight or line of fire of the player
(Requested by Matthias Rudolf).

- Added scrolls of Door Creation and Stair Creation and rings of Sustain Body and
Sustain Mind. Stair Creation is biased to create stairs in the direction you last
took.

### User Interface ###

- Created a nice graphics mode on windows that attempts to automagically fit
the tiled graphics and fonts together on the screen without forcing the tiled
graphics to scale.

enchant it with brands or resists.

maps.

- Fixed bug when describing sense item effect (Reported by Pav Lucistnik).

- Show monster health bar over gold when not showing the side bar (Many thanks
to Pav Lucistnik for the patch).

- If you ignore objects (including auto-ignoring of corpses), you are no longer
prompted to verify destruction even if you have the verify_destroy option selected.
In addition, you ignore objects under more circumstances (if they roll under you
or disappear from view). (Thanks to Pav Lucistnik for the patch).

- Study items now tell you that they can be researched when you inspect them. You
can also now browse the spells that you can research, if you are studying a magic
book or runestone only (Requestd by Matthias Rudolf).

- When Inspecting an object, the basic object functions are listed first, before
flags or damage (Following discussion with Pav Lucistnik).

- Confirm selected stat increase at level gain (Requested by Matthias Rudolf).

finished.

- If you kill a dungeon guardian, you will be notified when you are on the surface
of that dungeon that you have done so and where you can travel to.

- You will always choose your wielded light source to refuel, light or douse if
it can have the action applied to it (Requested by mikon). Unwield the light source
to pick an arbitary light, or to use the fill command.

innate abilities. They now use their huge attacks 50% of the time.

- Fixed bug where many monsters were firing magical bolts instead of crossbow bolts.

- Fixed bug where you guessed an object was magical e.g. (of Throwing?) when you learnt
a flag that was a normal property of the object.

Unangband 0.6.0 "Where's the Tequila? Did Tara Reid steal all the drinks?" (The Ari
Gold Release)

### Game Play ###

- Updated monster spell attacks to use the 4GAI from Sangband/Oangband via NPPAngband,
include numerous new and modified spell attacks and improve projection code.

- Stores now stock various services.

- You can now sell books to various stores to allow you to unlock additional store
services.

- The player can now be infected with various diseases. A number of disease causing
monsters from Eyangband have been added. The disease implementation is different from
any other variant.

- Various attacks, particularly paralyze, stun, confuse are less cumulative or not
cumulative - however, if you already are suffering the ill-effects that the attack
would cause, you now run the risk of getting the related effect recurring every 100 turns
or so. This now makes paralysis melee attacks survivable at depth provided you can
outlast the initial paralyzation, and have sufficiently high ac.

- Added item abilities including vampiric weapons of various flavours, light and dark
brands, anti-teleport items, racial-based items including slay human, slay elf and
slay dwarf items, and items that cause vulneribilities to various elements. In particular,
you cannot wield both a racial flag item and its equivalent slay, or a vulneribility
item and its equivalent brand.

- Added magic items, which are ego items which only have a single flag. This is
currently in heavy development and balancing, but is intended to provide a more
interesting transition between enchanted equipment and ego items. Ego items are 
temporarily disabled for testing purposes.

- Stat potions only provide a temporary stat increase. Removed restore stat potions.

- Monsters now breath in arcs, have additional bolt, ball, beam and summon spells
and a variety of miscellaneous spells as per NPPAngband.

- Monsters now can intelligently use their ranged melee blows at a distance (e.g.
gaze, wail, lash). These usually have limited range (lash) and require ammunition
(arrow, shot, bolt) or require mana to use (gaze, wail). Monsters will carry the
appropriate ammunition and drop it on their death.

- Monsters can now bleed or get poisoned by the player.

- Monsters can now lose strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity or constitution if
hit by various stat loss effects.

- Monsters can cast spells that turn themselves invisible, allow them to temporarily
pass walls, make them heroic or beserk, shield themselves or allow them to temporarily
resist all elements.

- Monsters can cast spells which curse the player, dispel enchantments on the player
and probe the player for weaknesses.

- Monsters can resist more effects, such as darkness, or be resistant to either blunt
or edged weapons, as well as evade player blows and missiles (From Sangband).

- Monsters can cast spells which animate the dead, animate objects or animate terrain
around them. Monsters can also cast spells that bring other monsters back to life.  A
much wider variety of summoning spells is also possible.

- Added a variety of monsters from Sangband and NPPAngband.

- Undead are now hurt by healing spells, and cured by drain life. Golems are now hurt
by haste spells and not hasted very well, if at all.

- Vents now act as conduits for water, acid, steam, fire or gas through walls.
Vents can also be climbed through, but block vision and ranged attacks.

- Falling water, lava, and so on now only cause damage to adjacent terrain every
second turn.

- Cracked walls now can come in hidden, weaker versions that can be easily
bashed or tunnelled through.

- Statues of hybrids can now occur. Figurines removed from the back end code.

- Spores and potions will explode when thrown.

- Added golem parts which can be assembled into a complete golem by activating the
parts.

- Added workshops, which contain golem parts and golems.

- Added statues of varying values. These are all extremely heavy however.

- Steam and other water damage that does not affect inventory items no longer douses
your light. Lights that ignore water also ignore the effect.

- Weapons you brand now ignore that element, preventing destruction by it.

- Modified some existing artifacts to add magical device skill or spell resistance.

- Added spells, scrolls and rods of feedback, which allow the player to detect hidden
resistances on high level items, and act as a limited attack weapon.

- Most terrain now floods when hit by water.

- No longer have partial moves or tiredness from normal movement, as this created
unnessary bookkeeping.

- Renamed individually appearing novice monsters to apprentice monsters.

- The cost of the cheapest magical attacks, such as magic missile, has been increased
to two mana. The low level elemental attacks have been renamed slightly, and beam
up to 3 distance now.

- Mages, rogues and rangers now get more starting mana.

- Added fixed quests that can be configured in the lib\edit\quests.txt file. These
allow a reasonably complicated set of actions. See the example Farmer Maggot quest.
However, scripting is not possible - the quests are data-driven. At the moment
the quests can be created, but have no in game functionality.

- You can now use diggers to create rock traps using the 'S' set trap command.
The power of the trap depends on the digging ability of the player.

- You now start playing the Lord of the Rings campaign by default.

- Monsters speak to each other about the player resistances, and whether they have
been attacked by the player. This is particularly noticeable in town.

- Level feelings will always be display when leaving a town.

- Implemented circular detection. The same area should be detected approximately
as for players using the 'standard' screen size.

- Monster experience is now computed via a power algorithm.

- You can now move to dodge, which means monsters have a % chance of targetting your
old location, and stand still to block, which increases your armour class temporarily.

- Character styles for monster killing and backstabbing also apply when firing a
weapon.

- If you wake a monster and fail to kill it, it will alert those around it.

- Monsters that correspond to player races now have similar abilities: dwarves resist
blindness, goblins are immune to poison, gnomes cannot be slowed or paralyzed. To
distinguish goblins from orcs, they have become the union of a love that dare not
speak its name.

- Tree trunks now block line of sight.

- Improved starting shops available in Hobbiton to try and make the start game easier.
(Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Added home (Actually the Inn of the Prancing Pony) and market place to Bree to make
it identical to Angband, and to introduce the idea of the home 'moving' about and
being available in other locations.

- Made a home of some kind available in all major city locations. The home is taken
away in enough circumstances already and there is more than enough need for it to be
present to store additional useful equipment.

- Added some additional stock such as darts and daggers to Hobbiton to make start
easier for some classes (Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Added a charisma dependent check for every time a store stocks an item, the shop
keeper will attempt to replace any item out of stock. This makes stores much more
useful for higher charisma players in that all items listed as being stock will be
in stock.

- There are now a number of further dungeons to explore between Farmer Maggot's
Farm and Weathertop including an early quest reward location for the player
(Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Two-weapon style is more effective, giving additional blows at levels 15, 30 and 45,
instead of 20 and 40, and better AC benefits (Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Paladins now also start with a second blow and get an extra one at level fourty. To
compensate, their maximum blows is reduced by 1. Warrior maximum blows are also reduced
by one, as e.g. it is possible to get 9 blows with a two-handed weapon by forgoing a
shield for a two-handed weapon specialist.

- All classes now benefit (slightly) from instruments.

- Flasks now burn instead of freeze (Reported by Hilke Reiter).

- Branding an item causes you to carry it instead of dropping it (Reported by Hilke
Reiter).

- Added locations next to Hobbiton and Farmer Maggot's farm to clearly indicate that
there is a choice to be made about which direction to go in next.

- Changed sequence of some dungeons.

- Made towns more interesting.

- Decrease the damage of flasks of oil as they are otherwise too effective. (Suggested
by Bandoras).

- Detrimental potions now affect monsters when thrown.

- It is now possible to reset your recall depth (From Angband).

- Line of sight effects (such as immolation) now affect grids and items where there
are monsters.

- Low social status characters start with hard liquor.

- Slays do four times damage except where there is an equivelent execution slay.  This
should make slays and brands more equivalent in strength.

- Changed slay evil to brand holy, and now do triple damage to evil monsters.

- Made ego-item names more interesting as opposed to *asterisked*.

- Made swords one third less common, made hafted weapons half as common and made polearms
between one half and one third as common.

- Changed how some items are evaluated as 'good'. In particular, high-level spell books
only count as good if you have not seen them previously.

- Made scrolls, potions and throwing weapons somewhat out of depth appear in stacks.

- Made ammunition, including new steel-tipped ammunition, more common.

- Nar the Dwarf now guards the Midge Marshes (Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

### User Interface ###

- Added 54x54.bmp and mask54.bmp containing David Gervais' isometric 54x54 tiles.

- You can now inscribe an item with =g5 to mean pick up this item unless I already have
5 of it in my inventory. You can also inscribe it with =d5 to mean don't pick up this item
if I have 5 or more of it in my inventory. You can also inscribe it with =k5 to mean destroy
it on pick-up if I have 5 or more of it in my inventory. You also inscribe it with =i5 to
mean ignore it if I have 5 or more of it in my inventory. (Suggested by Willem Siemelink on
rec.games.roguelike.angband).

- You can now inscribe an item with <5 to mean confirm if I have less than 5 of this in my
inventory and >5 to mean confirm if I have more than 5 of this in my inventory.

- Monster recall now reports what particular types of items are dropped by each
monster.

- 'v' toggles visual mode off as well as on.

- Show list of all items at the bottom of the screen.

- You know learn about all brands and slays as if you were checking your monster memory
after each hit. You also know randomly notice execution slays and brands or the absence
of brands, based on the damage delivered by the weapon per blow.

- Guessed (Blessed) weapons and so on should now display as (Blessed?) not ((Blessed)?).

- When displaying equipment, proper immunities are displayed differently from flags that
protect the character against the side effects of attacks.

- Prevented original graphic tiles from trying to use dark and lite tiles.

- Added Triple tile mode, which is like Double tile mode, but intended for
use with David Gervais' 54x54 graphics tiles (As 54 is not divisible by 4).

- Improve scrolling when setting visuals.

- Greatly improved isometric tile mode, so that it is now a playable option.
In particular, all tiles are correctly drawn and redrawn after every refresh.
However, many more monsters/objects etc. need to have the correct tiles
assigned to them and there are still visual artefacts that need to be
cleaned up.

- Additional categories in knowledge menus to display missing monster type (trees) and
the majority of remaining features.

- Only dump feature graphics to pref file that are actually used (and do not mimic another
feature). This misses invisible traps.

- Added command ^Q to display the current quests.

- Add ATTR_DOOR / ATTR_WALL / ATTR_ITEM to allow 2 way doors, 24 way walls, and 'item-like'
terrain (e.g. stuff that requires a floor graphic underneath) to pref file initialisation
and visual edit mode. In visual edit mode, use 'd', 'w' and 'f' (for floor) to toggle the
options on and off.

- Added option to ignore corpses and other junk on the ground. Switched on by default.
With the option on, these items still honour the =g flag.

- Added option to color the player depending on health (From several other variants).
Switched on by default.

- Shop entrances made to be outside locations, so new players don't get confused by
change in graphics when leaving a shop (Suggested by Hilke Reiter).

- Improved targetting code so it displays the line of fire, when selecting a target.

- Removed display of attributes an item is known not to have (Suggested on by Joshua
Rodman).

- Added self-knowledge command in the knowledge menu that acts like self-knowledge potion
but only for attributes you know you have.

- Added monster list from NPPAngband (Suggested by Joshua Rodman).

- Added disturb_near option.

- Only display room names by default, not full descriptions (Suggested by Joshua Rodman).

- Added options to verify whenever moving from a 'safe' to an 'unsafe' grid, and to mark
grids as safe when detect monster spell (of any time) has been cast.

- Added Christophe Cavalaria's mouse support patch.

- Automatically generate a random name at player birth. This can be overwritten.

- Allow any key press to load the last save file used at the start screen on Windows.

- Added mouse support to the majority of the game.

- It is now possible to specify '!' while targetting to automatically target the location
under the mouse pointer. This is intended for macros.

- Cut down slightly the number of key presses required to buy anything in a store.

- Added code to describe features. This will ultimately involve into feature lore similar
to NPPAngband's implementation.

- Mouse-clicking whilst confused will allow you to walk one step.

- Tree branches are now always displayed when you are outside.  This should prevent
the map 'randomly' changing when you move through forested areas on the surface.

- You can now examine a service in a store to determine what it does for you.

- To-hit, to-dam and to-ac benefits of a style are included in the character display.

- You can always see what room something is in whilst looking.

- Examining a monster related item recalls the monster (Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Changed the way town and room descriptions are displayed when entering the room to cut
down on key presses and make it easier to read.

- Spoilers for ego item power and slay effectiveness.

- Change the more prompt and key press acknowledgement when you get below your warning
hit points.

### Bug fixes ###

not for priests.  Now it is for priests, paladins, shamans and bards.  (Fixed
by kobayasi)

stored in the grid.

- Spell casters now buff themselves, not the player.

- Fixed bug where objects were destroyed incorrectly when a grid was changed.

- Killing a surface dungeon guardian should not create a set of stairs any
more. (Reported by Hilke Reiter).

- Farmer Maggot should no longer sing. Tom Bombadil will no longer crash the
game (Reported by darkDrone).

- Staffs should not stack incorrectly (Reported by will_asher).

- Non-weapon blessed or vampiric items should no longer be generated (Reported
by ekolis).

- Fixed bug where monsters would not alert each other if attacked by magic.

- Fixed crash bug caused by monsters trying to attack you with no power (reported
by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Fixed bug where magic items of throwing could be created, when the base item
was also of throwing (reported by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Fixed bug where creatures carrying mushrooms reported carrying special objects
(reported by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Fixed a number of memory corruption and crash bugs by running Valgrind against

- Fixed further bugs with attempting to track when an item does or does not have
an ability (Reported by Mikolaj Konarski).

- No longer mark monster ammunition as being of that race as it meant you couldn't
recall the item (Reported by Mikolaj Konarski)

### Build / Platform ###

- Added quest.txt in lib\edit which is used to defined fixed texts.

- Makefile.std was reporting errors if the files it tries to clean are not
there (Reported by Robert Ruehlmann).

- Removed all variant options from code.

- Separated out cave flags that are specific to the cave (cave_info) and
specific to the player (play_info) in preperation for implementing 4GAI
projection algorithms. This has to be done differently from Sangband et al.
as there can be terrain in Unangband that blocks line of sight but not 
spells or arrows (eg smoke). At the moment, most of these new flags are
not used.

- Cleaned up code somewhat by using monster flags more often instead of
depending on matching monster names.

- Significantly improved the monster metrics used for computing relative
monster power, for determining artifact and object slays. Some of this
from NPPAngband.

- Added an FAQ to the game for questions that have been asked on
rec.games.roguelike.angband. As most questions were only asked once, I'm
considering calling it the uniquely asked questions instead.

- Fixed some compiler warnings.



Unangband 0.5.5: "New Years Resolution"

### Game Play ###

- Much better handling of features which have corresponding objects 'stored'
in them, such as fountains, water, and so on.

- You can now destroy objects contained inside many features to change that
feature automatically eg destroying a torch in a torch feature.

- You can use the examine command on a feature that contain objects to create
instances of that object without having to throw the objects, refuel from it
or so on.

- You can now create 'flavoured' features, which contain differing instances
of the same object type, depending on the level at which the feature is
located. This is currently unused, but is intended to support different
types of fountains, trees, mineral veins and so on.

### User Interface ###

- Added 'show sidebar' option, which defaults to yes. Setting this to no moves
information normally on the left hand side of the main display to a more compact
format at the bottom of the window, making more space available for the map
display.

- Added experimental Double tile mode (Windows only), which is has tiles
twice as wide and high as regular tiles. When used along with big tiles, results
in tiles four times as wide and twice as high. Because the tiles have increased 
height as well as width, double tiles are currently not used in several areas that
support regular tiles. There are currently some visual artifacts.

- Added support for transparency in David Gervais's 32x32 support for
Windows users. This requires a (slightly altered) 32x32.bmp and a matching
mask32.bmp file and is (a little) more correct than equivelent X11 masking.

- Added experimental support for David Gervais's isometric tiles (Windows
only). This is currently 'proof-of-concept' only and does not require SDL.
However, it will result in many visual artifacts, and does not have many
tiles correctly assigned. Advantages from Hajo's Iso-metric tile support
include two differing iso-metric projections (Switched by toggling big tile
mode on and off), scaleable tile sizes, and support for mixing isometric
tiles and text (This is not possible on the main map though). Disadvantages
include no support for dynamically recolouring of tiles, no support for
lighting effects, incorrect draw order for tiles, incorrect masking of tiles
in front and behind, and other visual artefacts that currently make this 
(mostly) unusable. Do not attempt to assign tiles using the visual tile
assigner at this stage, as the supplied 54x54.bmp and mask54.bmp file are
only temporary and some poorly 'glued' together.

- Fixed some visual artifacts caused by the assumption that graphics tile
0 is a floor tile.

- Can now use 'k' in knowledge menus to toggle auto-destruction of objects,
'g' to toggle auto-pickup, 'i' to toggle auto-ignore, 's' to toggle auto-
stack. Other unrecognised characters will set a similiar auto-inscription
however these have no effect.

- "Great" weapons and ammo now much more likely to have additional damage
dice or sides. (From NPPAngband)

- If you specify a different terrain for invisible traps, it is used to
identify unsafe floors.

### Bug fixes ###

- Many low level spell casting monsters were casting mana bolt instead of
magic missile.

- Objects were incorrectly being initialised as aware, as per Angband. Now
only become aware when you see the object for the first time.

- Could not see some objects (eg corpses) in knowledge menus as they did
not randomly appear in the dungeon. (Reported by topazg).

- Delete the dump.prf file after generating a screen dump, to prevent this
file becoming excessively large.

- Fixed broken html dump code.

- Non-ego weapons with improved damage dice or sides now sense as "great".

- You could spike a door multiple times to break it (Reported by @nothere).

- Doors did not appear jammed after first spiking them (Reported by @nothere).



UnAngband 0.5.4c: "Competitive Fix"

### Game Play ###

- Snow, particularly deep snow, is riskier again.

### User Interface ###

- Improved user interface for selecting which location to travel to.

### Bug fixes ###

- The chance of tunnelling was out by a factor of 10 (Reported by Jeffrey
Turner).

- Piles of earth were removed, resulting in 'nothing' occuring in some rooms.
(Reported by Anthony Holmes).

- Occasionally on the far right of the map, the wrong panel would be displayed
(Reported by Anthony Holmes).

- Isengard should now be full of trees again.


UnAngband 0.5.4b: "Survival of the Fittest"

### Game Play ###

- The Dale now has a food supply (Bug 588).

- If you fire or thrown an object that misses a monster, it will continue to
travel along the line of fire, possibly hitting other monsters in its path.

- The variant and save file options are now compulsory, and removed from the
user interface.

- One rod in a stack of recharging rods will recharge in (t - n) time, where
t is the timeout of the stack and n is the number of rods recharging. This
allows rods to be reused more quickly, and where the rod timeout is less than
stack size, you can reuse a rod every turn.

- You can notice hidden features at greater ranges, but features deeper in
the dungeon are harder to notice (From Sangband).

- Torches have a larger light radius when they are more fuelly fueled (From
Sangband).

- You now hold or stay after each step, so that you will use 100 energy per
move unless you are disturbed.

### User Interface ###

- Now supports specifying whether or not a feature supports advanced lighting
options in the pref file.

- Knowledge menu sub-items are sorted alphabetically. This could be changed 
in the future to allow a selection of possible sort orders (Depth, kills etc).

- 'view_flavors' option is added, which allows you to display, eg, known rings
of speed using a different graphics consistently from game to game. This also
allows all the David Gervais known scroll graphics to be used when a scroll is
found. Switch this option from TRUE (The Angband default) to FALSE to enable
this.

- Display problems due to Windows XP eliminated by not using the centred dot
character.

### Bug fixes ###

- Eilineil the Entrapped is now a female (Bug 648).

- The ruins of Lake-town are no longer too deep for those who flee the Lonely
Mountain (Bug 589).

- Objects resistant to damage will only display a message the first time they
are unaffected (Bug 682).

- Support transparency for graphics modes (Bug 782).

- Updated pref files required for 32x32 bit maps (Bug 777).

- Improved 'visual' editting code from Hengband (Bug 778).

- Fixed map refresh bugs caused in big tile mode (Bug 780).

- Improved support for advanced lighting features in graphics mode (Bug 779).

- Handle being stuck inside terrain correctly in all instances (Bug 807).

- Fixed spurious and incorrect messages when monster hits player trap (Bug
808).

- Monsters can now tunnel (Bug 605).

- Monsters will no longer push each other around, preventing them from
moving or attacking successfully (Bug 653).

- Hidden monsters can no longer pick up objects from the ground or be hit
by missile or thrown weapons (Bug 654).

- Priest spell banish evil now works (Bug 681).

- Can no longer browse illegible spells (Bug 253).

- Spells and items that brand objects correctly tell you which brand they
provide when inspected or browsed.

- Additional features can be editted from within knowledge menus.

- Can correctly edit the displayed graphic for tree tops.

- Flavoured items are now correctly displayed when unknown for all graphics.

- Character dump version updated.

### Build / Platform ###

- Remove references to nangband in makefile.

- Reduce compiler warnings through bogus assignments. I have mixed thoughts on
this, as to whether it is better to change function declarations than use
bogus assignments, or perhaps leave warnings intact. These warnings only occur
in GCC 3 or later.


UnAngband 0.5.4a: "A Whole Lotta Love"

### Game-play ###

- Added high-level guardians to remaining areas in campaign mode.

- Replaced fletchers with jewellers in Edoras.


### Build / Platform ###

- readdib.[ch] were old.

- Fixed definition of user_name() for Linux port.


### Bug fixes ###

- Fixed some elves that were incorrectly using the 'h' symbol.

- Disallow object recall for unknown flavored objects.

- Incorrect default note was set for object and ego inscriptions
  if there were no note.

- Fixed some bugs in room.txt

- Some dungeon names are misspelt.

- Loading an old savefile crashed the game.

- Some spell flags were not handled in spell_desc()

- You could not tonnnel cages while stuck in them.

- Some boolean variables are incorrectly set when getting bit flags.

- teleport_away() was swapping a monster and another monster or a
  player if there is one on a random place.

- A window flag for "Display room description" window was not saved.

- Fixed a minor bug about monster recall flag on OLD_DRAIN spell.

- The game crashed at the end of the game.

- Messages for ice bolt said "a prasma bolt"

- Object usage counters for armors are never updated.

- When an object become known to have some flags, may flags
  on all kits should be removed.

- "(D) Base Delay Factor" was not displayed.

- It was possible to destroy cursed equipments.

- Fixed the bug which forbids more than 64 spells by introduciing new
  option "variant_study_more" which really allows more than 64 spells
  to be studied.  Old option "variant_more_spells" is left for
  savefile compatibility, and now effects only on the number of spell
  kind.

- The game occasionally crashed when shooting at nearly dead monster.

- Changed form of Wizard Lock to BEAM from STRIKE to correctly close
  and jam an open door.

- You must now climb out of pits/chasms/spider webs/thickets/thorns, taking a
double move.

- Added hilly terrain which uses '<' graphic. This is primarily for expanded
wilderness generation, when that is implemented.

- Added shallow pits, which provide cover for monsters hiding in them.

- Allows runestones to be used from the floor now.

- Spells available on runestones are now affected by the day of the lunar
cycle.

use special graphics for identified items of various sorts.

- Changed how many locations are displayed so that viewing options affect more
terrain.

- Added option view_surface_lite that allows you to see which terrain is 'indoors'
when you are on the surface (In particular, terrain covered by tree branches).

currently used, but if you copy them into your Zangband lib\edit directory
(Backing up the current versions of the files), you can see an Unangband
'version' of the Zangband wilderness, using Unangband's version of the terrain
graphics. (Uses Zangband 2.7.1). This is for testing purposes and comments...

- Updated copyright notices in source.

Unangband 0.5.2b Bugfix release

Unangband 0.5.2a Bugfix release

### Game-play ###

- Bill Ferny now guards the bottom of Bree.

- The Trollshaw forest is now harder.

- Bert, Bill and Tom occur earlier in non-campaign mode.

### User Interface ###

- Added ability to redefine visual prefs using the knowledge menus (~).
This is done via a graphic user interface type setting, allowing you to
see large numbers of possible graphics to select from.

- If you specify a graphic/attr/char mapping for e.g. a potion of speed,
once you become aware of the object, it will use this mapping rather than
still using the flavour attr/char mapping. This for instance allows you
to colour all 'bad' potions/scrolls/etc. dark grey so that you don't
attempt to get them.

- The objects menu under the knowledge menu now lists the flavours of
all unknown objects, primarily so you can interact with the visuals for
these objects. This is different for Eyangband, which lists the objects
you know of, but have not found this game.

- Added reference to new web site at http://unangband.berlios.de.

- Made torches light brown, and other junk dark brown.

### Build / Platform ###

- Removed use of 'near' member of structure as used as a reserved
keyword in VC++.

### Bug fixes ###

- Actually made teleport a lot safer to use. You will not be placed in
potentially dangerous grids.

- Fixed bug where monster could end up in unsafe grids for the monster
after teleporting.

- Fixed bug where town/dungeon name and depth were displayed in wrong
part of screen if window is resized.

- Fixed some flags for various types of terrain.

- Fixed bug where learning a spell would report it as a song (Reported
 by Adam Horowitz).

- Fixed bugs so that you can escape locations where you are stuck other
than by teleporting.

- Partially fixed bug so that at least 'aware' flavoured items are
displayed with correct graphic when using graphics.

Angband 0.5.2 "I'm on fire" release

I have reorganised this changes.txt file to similar to what Eytan Zweig
 uses for Eyangband. It should be clearer what the changes are.

To see what changes have been made for previous versions, check the 
previous release (0.5.1d).

### Game-play ###

- Giant spider webs can now allow spells cast through them.

- You can now no longer recall from a dungeon to a town in a different 
location, as it was too unclear for when this case would apply.

- You can now affect doors and other terrain with bolt spells as well 
as ball spells.

- Smoke/steam removed by cold attacks (Suggested by Adam Horowitz).

- Guardians on surface levels and dungeon towns are now generated
during daytime as well  (But still only night time in surface towns).

- Statues/containers/body parts now give you some information about the
 monster when you discover them.

- Removed Create Golem spell until friendly monsters are implemented.

- Added Heavy Armoury, Heavy Weaponsmith, Runesmith and Chemist and 
added to and reorganised stores in a number of towns.

- Improved store inventories in Jewelers, Marketplace, Barracks and 
Blackmarket to be more appropriate for players at the level they will 
encounter the stores. Note that the Blackmarket in Angband will now 
generate items at a deeper level.

- If you are hidden in darkness, a lot more monsters will use light to
 see by...

- Dungeon entrances are now lit, so they are easier to find at night...

- Added King of the Wood Elves, Faramir, Boromir and Denethor, and 
reorganised some of later campaign to be a smoother transition from end
 of Moria/Isengard/Caradhras.

- Removed escorts from Tom Bombadil, and summon kin, as it felt a little
 'wrong' (Not as bad as killing him of course ;)

- Made dynamic terrain allowing forests to burn down, seas to have waves
 and various other effects, poison gas and smoke to spread and disappate.

- Added waves and wave crests to allow water to have waves in it. These
look and act like 'real' waves.

- Doors and other wooden objects now cause persistent fires, which can be
put out by bashing them.

- Teleport is now a lot safer to use. You will not be placed in
potentially dangerous grids.

- Musical instruments will now occasionally be ego items.

- Torches, lanterns, etc. now will also affect the terrain under them
as well as the monster.

- Some weapons are now 'throwing': to use them, unequip your bow or
cross-bow, and use the fire command. You will see which weapons are
available as throwing weapons. This is currently daggers, batons,
darts, javelins and spears, all potions, flasks, bottles and sling
ammunition.  Throwing weapons get a much greater range, and their
to hit and damage bonuses count for double when fired. Warning:
using the throw command will not give you these benefits.

- Slings can now fire any 'throwing' weapon, allowing you to lob
potions (Such as potions of Detonations) to much greater distances.

- Added Burning arrows and Batons.

- Potions of Death are now very expensive.


### User Interface ###

- Added ability to create html screen dumps similar to T.O.M.E. This can 
be invoked with the ] key on the main map.

- Added ability to create html screen dumps at any time using the Ctrl-
right-bracket (^]) short cut. This uses the current visual preferences 
instead of temporarily reseting these preferences to the underlying 
settings. However it has much greater flexibility, and can be used 
anytime Angband expects user interaction.

- Now use Enter to continue and ESC to restart the character generation
 process.

- Also use Enter to recall an object/monster/ego item/artifact in the
knowledge menus.

- You can now recall objects while you are looking at them. You will 
recall the monster instead if they are a monster body part or container
 or statue...

- Added option view_glowing_lite which applies special (eg torch-lit) 
lighting to boring grids that are adjacent to glowing features such as 
torches in a room. This is another 'pretty' function that may cause a 
slight performance hit, but should make those screen dumps even 
prettier.

- Updated the help files to reflect the above commands.


### Build / Platform ###

- Added readdib.c and removed angband.res to allow compilation for 
makefile.cyg

- Revamped OS X version--no more QuickDraw, OS X support currently limited to
   versions 10.3.x and later. Menu model is somewhat more 'Apple-compliant'.

- Recovered graphics support in OSX.

### Bugfixes ### 

- Fixed bug where archer, shaman, bard classes were getting too many 

blows.

- Fixed bug where ego items would be revealed if they were generated in
 a store, even if subsequently discarded.

- Fixed bug where scrolls of Curse Armour/ Curse Weapon effects were 
reversed.

- Fixed a bug where Bree town levels extended several levels into the 
dungeon. (Most bugs reported by Adam Horowitz for this release).

- Fix division by 0 bug with guard condition in randart generation code
 that was causing crashes at end of character generation.

- Tidied up some problems with terrain causing crasher bugs in campaign
 mode. Also fixed some logic problems.

- Trapped doors should work now.

- Fixed bug preventing creation of town in Minas Tirith.

- Fixed bug where flying/climbing monsters could walk through walls on
the surface.

- Fixed bug where outside locations could end up dark during day time.

- Using some wands from the ground, could cause problems as they could
be destroyed by their effects.

- Fixed bug preventing 'I'nspection of an object displaying anything
to the screen.

- Fixed logic bug: thrown specialists now gain their might/shots
benefits, but only with throwing weapons.

- Fixed bug where loading a deceased character would fail if it was
carrying a random artifact numbered higher than the regular artifacts.
(Reported by Adam Horowitz). This will load any affected save file.
