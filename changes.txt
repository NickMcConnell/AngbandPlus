Added monster races which have no class and have natural powers and can gain natural AC and speed as they level, and at set levels can evolve into different forms that have new stats, flags and powers
Monsters are assigned the monster class, which has skill values equal to a paladin
Added "standard bearer" unique monsters - if you're their species, and you kill them, you'll become perma-blessed & heroic and they'll drop a special artifact.  Non-members of their species have a 1/15 chance of getting the artifact, which is normally pretty strong for its level.
changed the equip item interface slightly so it shows all slots
changed player dumps so they only show full slots
changed character sheet to 3 seperate pages
score is registered for suicides
increased max xp 10-fold , because why not
quickstart disabled.. evolution screws it up
acquirement changed so that it generates objects based on the farthest depths you've reached, not current depth.. also only grants items you can use

Progression:

TODO:
from high to low priority:
copy over pos' balanced ice/water, fire/lava, etc elementals
maybe copy ainur too
more powers for new monsters
infinite home room (put on hold)
summoning (hard)
quests (easy)
level 30 monsters should have about 5 net bonus points to stats - rationalize stat points, flags, hp, xp across monsters.. then do it all while blindfolded and on fire
add fire_arc, change br weapons to use it
terrain, terrain modifying spells (e.g. Ainur spells) (med)
possessors (hard)
monster alignment - law/chaos (easy)
invisibility/blindness (easy?)

my own TODO:
add Nick's sweet egos
add different classes for monsters: monster (base kind), possessor (doesn't evolve but can deincarnate and grab new bodies),
	chaosspawn (50% chance to evolve every level, evolves into random body based on lvl)

bugs:
screen redrawing means messages before evolution are dropped
level gain messages can be displayed 2x or more if they occur after evolving
can't use 'repeat command' with race powers
powers can't use HP in lieu of mana (feature or bug?)
equippy chars don't display on main screen(design problem.. how to deal with a line too long?)
innate melee info not displayed
BAD PROGRAMMING: racial powers files should be in their own folder and better organized, I lazily copied them from pos
eq slots past 23 aren't labelled correctly
player dumps show level X being achieved multiple times, eg:
    215913   2000'   31   Reached level 31
    215942   2000'   31   Found The Leather Scale Mail 'Thalkettoth'
    224523   2100'   31   Reached level 31
    226574   2100'   31   Reached level 31
this might be bc of !restore XP
