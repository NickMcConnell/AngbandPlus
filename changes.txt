Unangband 0.6.0 "Where's the Tequila? Did Tara Reid steal all the drinks?" (The Ari
Gold Release)

### Game Play ###

- Updated monster spell attacks to use the 4GAI from Sangband/Oangband via NPPAngband,
include numerous new and modified spell attacks and improve projection code.

- Stores now stock various services.

- You can now sell books to various stores to allow you to unlock additional store
services.

- The player can now be infected with various diseases. A number of disease causing
monsters from Eyangband have been added. The disease implementation is different from
any other variant.

- Various attacks, particularly paralyze, stun, confuse are less cumulative or not
cumulative - however, if you already are suffering the ill-effects that the attack
would cause, you now run the risk of getting the related effect recurring every 100 turns
or so. This now makes paralysis melee attacks survivable at depth provided you can
outlast the initial paralyzation, and have sufficiently high ac.

- Added item abilities including vampiric weapons of various flavours, light and dark
brands, anti-teleport items, racial-based items including slay human, slay elf and
slay dwarf items, and items that cause vulneribilities to various elements. In particular,
you cannot wield both a racial flag item and its equivalent slay, or a vulneribility
item and its equivalent brand.

- Added magic items, which are ego items which only have a single flag. This is
currently in heavy development and balancing, but is intended to provide a more
interesting transition between enchanted equipment and ego items. Ego items are 
temporarily disabled for testing purposes.

- Stat potions only provide a temporary stat increase. Removed restore stat potions.

- Monsters now breath in arcs, have additional bolt, ball, beam and summon spells
and a variety of miscellaneous spells as per NPPAngband.

- Monsters now can intelligently use their ranged melee blows at a distance (e.g.
gaze, wail, lash). These usually have limited range (lash) and require ammunition
(arrow, shot, bolt) or require mana to use (gaze, wail). Monsters will carry the
appropriate ammunition and drop it on their death.

- Monsters can now bleed or get poisoned by the player.

- Monsters can now lose strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity or constitution if
hit by various stat loss effects.

- Monsters can cast spells that turn themselves invisible, allow them to temporarily
pass walls, make them heroic or beserk, shield themselves or allow them to temporarily
resist all elements.

- Monsters can cast spells which curse the player, dispel enchantments on the player
and probe the player for weaknesses.

- Monsters can resist more effects, such as darkness, or be resistant to either blunt
or edged weapons, as well as evade player blows and missiles (From Sangband).

- Monsters can cast spells which animate the dead, animate objects or animate terrain
around them. Monsters can also cast spells that bring other monsters back to life.  A
much wider variety of summoning spells is also possible.

- Added a variety of monsters from Sangband and NPPAngband.

- Undead are now hurt by healing spells, and cured by drain life. Golems are now hurt
by haste spells and not hasted very well, if at all.

- Vents now act as conduits for water, acid, steam, fire or gas through walls.
Vents can also be climbed through, but block vision and ranged attacks.

- Falling water, lava, and so on now only cause damage to adjacent terrain every
second turn.

- Cracked walls now can come in hidden, weaker versions that can be easily
bashed or tunnelled through.

- Statues of hybrids can now occur. Figurines removed from the back end code.

- Spores and potions will explode when thrown.

- Added golem parts which can be assembled into a complete golem by activating the
parts.

- Added workshops, which contain golem parts and golems.

- Added statues of varying values. These are all extremely heavy however.

- Steam and other water damage that does not affect inventory items no longer douses
your light. Lights that ignore water also ignore the effect.

- Weapons you brand now ignore that element, preventing destruction by it.

- Modified some existing artifacts to add magical device skill or spell resistance.

- Added spells, scrolls and rods of feedback, which allow the player to detect hidden
resistances on high level items, and act as a limited attack weapon.

- Most terrain now floods when hit by water.

- No longer have partial moves or tiredness from normal movement, as this created
unnessary bookkeeping.

- Renamed individually appearing novice monsters to apprentice monsters.

- The cost of the cheapest magical attacks, such as magic missile, has been increased
to two mana. The low level elemental attacks have been renamed slightly, and beam
up to 3 distance now.

- Mages, rogues and rangers now get more starting mana.

- Added fixed quests that can be configured in the lib\edit\quests.txt file. These
allow a reasonably complicated set of actions. See the example Farmer Maggot quest.
However, scripting is not possible - the quests are data-driven. At the moment
the quests can be created, but have no in game functionality.

- You can now use diggers to create rock traps using the 'S' set trap command.
The power of the trap depends on the digging ability of the player.

- You now start playing the Lord of the Rings campaign by default.

- Monsters speak to each other about the player resistances, and whether they have
been attacked by the player. This is particularly noticeable in town.

- Level feelings will always be display when leaving a town.

- Implemented circular detection. The same area should be detected approximately
as for players using the 'standard' screen size.

- Monster experience is now computed via a power algorithm.

- You can now move to dodge, which means monsters have a % chance of targetting your
old location, and stand still to block, which increases your armour class temporarily.

- Character styles for monster killing and backstabbing also apply when firing a
weapon.

- If you wake a monster and fail to kill it, it will alert those around it.

- Monsters that correspond to player races now have similar abilities: dwarves resist
blindness, goblins are immune to poison, gnomes cannot be slowed or paralyzed. To
distinguish goblins from orcs, they have become the union of a love that dare not
speak its name.

- Tree trunks now block line of sight.

- Improved starting shops available in Hobbiton to try and make the start game easier.
(Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Added home (Actually the Inn of the Prancing Pony) and market place to Bree to make
it identical to Angband, and to introduce the idea of the home 'moving' about and
being available in other locations.

- Made a home of some kind available in all major city locations. The home is taken
away in enough circumstances already and there is more than enough need for it to be
present to store additional useful equipment.

- Added some additional stock such as darts and daggers to Hobbiton to make start
easier for some classes (Suggested by mikon).

- Added a charisma dependent check for every time a store stocks an item, the shop
keeper will attempt to replace any item out of stock. This makes stores much more
useful for higher charisma players in that all items listed as being stock will be
in stock.

- There are now a number of further dungeons to explore between Farmer Maggot's
Farm and Weathertop including an early quest reward location for the player
(Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Two-weapon style is more effective, giving additional blows at levels 15, 30 and 45,
instead of 20 and 40, and better AC benefits (Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Paladins now also start with a second blow and get an extra one at level fourty. To
compensate, their maximum blows is reduced by 1. Warrior maximum blows are also reduced
by one, as e.g. it is possible to get 9 blows with a two-handed weapon by forgoing a
shield for a two-handed weapon specialist.

- All classes now benefit (slightly) from instruments.

- Flasks now burn instead of freeze (Reported by Hilke Reiter).

- Branding an item causes you to carry it instead of dropping it (Reported by Hilke
Reiter).

- Added locations next to Hobbiton and Farmer Maggot's farm to clearly indicate that
there is a choice to be made about which direction to go in next.

- Changed sequence of some dungeons.

- Made towns more interesting.

- Decrease the damage of flasks of oil as they are otherwise too effective. (Suggested
by Bandoras).

- Detrimental potions now affect monsters when thrown.

- It is now possible to reset your recall depth (From Angband).

- Line of sight effects (such as immoliation) now affect grids and items where there
are monsters.

- Low social status characters start with hard liquor.

- Slays do four times damage except where there is an equivelent execution slay.  This
should make slays and brands more equivalent in strength.

- Changed slay evil to brand holy, and now do triple damage to evil monsters.

- Made ego-item names more interesting as opposed to *asterisked*.

- Made swords one third less common, made hafted weapons half as common and made polearms
between one half and one third as common.

- Changed how some items are evaluated as 'good'. In particular, high-level spell books
only count as good if you have not seen them previously.

- Made scrolls, potions and throwing weapons somewhat out of depth appear in stacks.

- Made ammunition, including new steel-tipped ammunition, more common.

- Nar the Dwarf now guards the Midge Marshes (Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

### User Interface ###

- Added 54x54.bmp and mask54.bmp containing David Gervais' isometric 54x54 tiles.

- You can now inscribe an item with =g5 to mean pick up this item unless I already have
5 of it in my inventory. You can also inscribe it with =d5 to mean don't pick up this item
if I have 5 or more of it in my inventory. You can also inscribe it with =k5 to mean destroy
it on pick-up if I have 5 or more of it in my inventory. You also inscribe it with =i5 to
mean ignore it if I have 5 or more of it in my inventory. (Suggested by Willem Siemelink on
rec.games.roguelike.angband).

- You can now inscribe an item with <5 to mean confirm if I have less than 5 of this in my
inventory and >5 to mean confirm if I have more than 5 of this in my inventory.

- Monster recall now reports what particular types of items are dropped by each
monster.

- 'v' toggles visual mode off as well as on.

- Show list of all items at the bottom of the screen.

- You know learn about all brands and slays as if you were checking your monster memory
after each hit. You also know randomly notice execution slays and brands or the absence
of brands, based on the damage delivered by the weapon per blow.

- Guessed (Blessed) weapons and so on should now display as (Blessed?) not ((Blessed)?).

- When displaying equipment, proper immunities are displayed differently from flags that
protect the character against the side effects of attacks.

- Prevented original graphic tiles from trying to use dark and lite tiles.

- Added Triple tile mode, which is like Double tile mode, but intended for
use with David Gervais' 54x54 graphics tiles (As 54 is not divisible by 4).

- Improve scrolling when setting visuals.

- Greatly improved isometric tile mode, so that it is now a playable option.
In particular, all tiles are correctly drawn and redrawn after every refresh.
However, many more monsters/objects etc. need to have the correct tiles
assigned to them and there are still visual artefacts that need to be
cleaned up.

- Additional categories in knowledge menus to display missing monster type (trees) and
the majority of remaining features.

- Only dump feature graphics to pref file that are actually used (and do not mimic another
feature). This misses invisible traps.

- Added command ^Q to display the current quests.

- Add ATTR_DOOR / ATTR_WALL / ATTR_ITEM to allow 2 way doors, 24 way walls, and 'item-like'
terrain (e.g. stuff that requires a floor graphic underneath) to pref file initialisation
and visual edit mode. In visual edit mode, use 'd', 'w' and 'f' (for floor) to toggle the
options on and off.

- Added option to ignore corpses and other junk on the ground. Switched on by default.
With the option on, these items still honour the =g flag.

- Added option to color the player depending on health (From several other variants).
Switched on by default.

- Shop entrances made to be outside locations, so new players don't get confused by
change in graphics when leaving a shop (Suggested by Hilke Reiter).

- Improved targetting code so it displays the line of fire, when selecting a target.

- Removed display of attributes an item is known not to have (Suggested on by Joshua
Rodman).

- Added self-knowledge command in the knowledge menu that acts like self-knowledge potion
but only for attributes you know you have.

- Added monster list from NPPAngband (Suggested by Joshua Rodman).

- Added disturb_near option.

- Only display room names by default, not full descriptions (Suggested by Joshua Rodman).

- Added options to verify whenever moving from a 'safe' to an 'unsafe' grid, and to mark
grids as safe when detect monster spell (of any time) has been cast.

- Added Christophe Cavalaria's mouse support patch.

- Automatically generate a random name at player birth. This can be overwritten.

- Allow any key press to load the last save file used at the start screen on Windows.

- Added mouse support to the majority of the game.

- It is now possible to specify '!' while targetting to automatically target the location
under the mouse pointer. This is intended for macros.

- Cut down slightly the number of key presses required to buy anything in a store.

- Added code to describe features. This will ultimately involve into feature lore similar
to NPPAngband's implementation.

- Mouse-clicking whilst confused will allow you to walk one step.

- Tree branches are now always displayed when you are outside.  This should prevent
the map 'randomly' changing when you move through forested areas on the surface.

- You can now examine a service in a store to determine what it does for you.

- To-hit, to-dam and to-ac benefits of a style are included in the character display.

- You can always see what room something is in whilst looking.

- Examining a monster related item recalls the monster (Suggested by Mikolaj Konarski).

- Changed the way town and room descriptions are displayed when entering the room to cut
down on key presses and make it easier to read.

- Spoilers for ego item power and slay effectiveness.

- Change the more prompt and key press acknowledgement when you get below your warning
hit points.

### Build / Platform ###

- Added quest.txt in lib\edit which is used to defined fixed texts.

- Makefile.std was reporting errors if the files it tries to clean are not
there (Reported by Robert Ruehlmann).

- Removed all variant options from code.

- Separated out cave flags that are specific to the cave (cave_info) and
specific to the player (play_info) in preperation for implementing 4GAI
projection algorithms. This has to be done differently from Sangband et al.
as there can be terrain in Unangband that blocks line of sight but not 
spells or arrows (eg smoke). At the moment, most of these new flags are
not used.

- Cleaned up code somewhat by using monster flags more often instead of
depending on matching monster names.

- Significantly improved the monster metrics used for computing relative
monster power, for determining artifact and object slays. Some of this
from NPPAngband.

- Added an FAQ to the game for questions that have been asked on
rec.games.roguelike.angband. As most questions were only asked once, I'm
considering calling it the uniquely asked questions instead.

- Fixed some compiler warnings.



Unangband 0.5.5: "New Years Resolution"

### Game Play ###

- Much better handling of features which have corresponding objects 'stored'
in them, such as fountains, water, and so on.

- You can now destroy objects contained inside many features to change that
feature automatically eg destroying a torch in a torch feature.

- You can use the examine command on a feature that contain objects to create
instances of that object without having to throw the objects, refuel from it
or so on.

- You can now create 'flavoured' features, which contain differing instances
of the same object type, depending on the level at which the feature is
located. This is currently unused, but is intended to support different
types of fountains, trees, mineral veins and so on.

### User Interface ###

- Added 'show sidebar' option, which defaults to yes. Setting this to no moves
information normally on the left hand side of the main display to a more compact
format at the bottom of the window, making more space available for the map
display.

- Added experimental Double tile mode (Windows only), which is has tiles
twice as wide and high as regular tiles. When used along with big tiles, results
in tiles four times as wide and twice as high. Because the tiles have increased 
height as well as width, double tiles are currently not used in several areas that
support regular tiles. There are currently some visual artifacts.

- Added support for transparency in David Gervais's 32x32 support for
Windows users. This requires a (slightly altered) 32x32.bmp and a matching
mask32.bmp file and is (a little) more correct than equivelent X11 masking.

- Added experimental support for David Gervais's isometric tiles (Windows
only). This is currently 'proof-of-concept' only and does not require SDL.
However, it will result in many visual artifacts, and does not have many
tiles correctly assigned. Advantages from Hajo's Iso-metric tile support
include two differing iso-metric projections (Switched by toggling big tile
mode on and off), scaleable tile sizes, and support for mixing isometric
tiles and text (This is not possible on the main map though). Disadvantages
include no support for dynamically recolouring of tiles, no support for
lighting effects, incorrect draw order for tiles, incorrect masking of tiles
in front and behind, and other visual artefacts that currently make this 
(mostly) unusable. Do not attempt to assign tiles using the visual tile
assigner at this stage, as the supplied 54x54.bmp and mask54.bmp file are
only temporary and some poorly 'glued' together.

- Fixed some visual artifacts caused by the assumption that graphics tile
0 is a floor tile.

- Can now use 'k' in knowledge menus to toggle auto-destruction of objects,
'g' to toggle auto-pickup, 'i' to toggle auto-ignore, 's' to toggle auto-
stack. Other unrecognised characters will set a similiar auto-inscription
however these have no effect.

- "Great" weapons and ammo now much more likely to have additional damage
dice or sides. (From NPPAngband)

- If you specify a different terrain for invisible traps, it is used to
identify unsafe floors.

### Bug fixes ###

- Many low level spell casting monsters were casting mana bolt instead of
magic missile.

- Objects were incorrectly being initialised as aware, as per Angband. Now
only become aware when you see the object for the first time.

- Could not see some objects (eg corpses) in knowledge menus as they did
not randomly appear in the dungeon. (Reported by topazg).

- Delete the dump.prf file after generating a screen dump, to prevent this
file becoming excessively large.

- Fixed broken html dump code.

- Non-ego weapons with improved damage dice or sides now sense as "great".

- You could spike a door multiple times to break it (Reported by @nothere).

- Doors did not appear jammed after first spiking them (Reported by @nothere).



UnAngband 0.5.4c: "Competitive Fix"

### Game Play ###

- Snow, particularly deep snow, is riskier again.

### User Interface ###

- Improved user interface for selecting which location to travel to.

### Bug fixes ###

- The chance of tunnelling was out by a factor of 10 (Reported by Jeffrey
Turner).

- Piles of earth were removed, resulting in 'nothing' occuring in some rooms.
(Reported by Anthony Holmes).

- Occasionally on the far right of the map, the wrong panel would be displayed
(Reported by Anthony Holmes).

- Isengard should now be full of trees again.


UnAngband 0.5.4b: "Survival of the Fittest"

### Game Play ###

- The Dale now has a food supply (Bug 588).

- If you fire or thrown an object that misses a monster, it will continue to
travel along the line of fire, possibly hitting other monsters in its path.

- The variant and save file options are now compulsory, and removed from the
user interface.

- One rod in a stack of recharging rods will recharge in (t - n) time, where
t is the timeout of the stack and n is the number of rods recharging. This
allows rods to be reused more quickly, and where the rod timeout is less than
stack size, you can reuse a rod every turn.

- You can notice hidden features at greater ranges, but features deeper in
the dungeon are harder to notice (From Sangband).

- Torches have a larger light radius when they are more fuelly fueled (From
Sangband).

- You now hold or stay after each step, so that you will use 100 energy per
move unless you are disturbed.

### User Interface ###

- Now supports specifying whether or not a feature supports advanced lighting
options in the pref file.

- Knowledge menu sub-items are sorted alphabetically. This could be changed 
in the future to allow a selection of possible sort orders (Depth, kills etc).

- 'view_flavors' option is added, which allows you to display, eg, known rings
of speed using a different graphics consistently from game to game. This also
allows all the David Gervais known scroll graphics to be used when a scroll is
found. Switch this option from TRUE (The Angband default) to FALSE to enable
this.

- Display problems due to Windows XP eliminated by not using the centred dot
character.

### Bug fixes ###

- Eilineil the Entrapped is now a female (Bug 648).

- The ruins of Lake-town are no longer too deep for those who flee the Lonely
Mountain (Bug 589).

- Objects resistant to damage will only display a message the first time they
are unaffected (Bug 682).

- Support transparency for graphics modes (Bug 782).

- Updated pref files required for 32x32 bit maps (Bug 777).

- Improved 'visual' editting code from Hengband (Bug 778).

- Fixed map refresh bugs caused in big tile mode (Bug 780).

- Improved support for advanced lighting features in graphics mode (Bug 779).

- Handle being stuck inside terrain correctly in all instances (Bug 807).

- Fixed spurious and incorrect messages when monster hits player trap (Bug
808).

- Monsters can now tunnel (Bug 605).

- Monsters will no longer push each other around, preventing them from
moving or attacking successfully (Bug 653).

- Hidden monsters can no longer pick up objects from the ground or be hit
by missile or thrown weapons (Bug 654).

- Priest spell banish evil now works (Bug 681).

- Can no longer browse illegible spells (Bug 253).

- Spells and items that brand objects correctly tell you which brand they
provide when inspected or browsed.

- Additional features can be editted from within knowledge menus.

- Can correctly edit the displayed graphic for tree tops.

- Flavoured items are now correctly displayed when unknown for all graphics.

- Character dump version updated.

### Build / Platform ###

- Remove references to nangband in makefile.

- Reduce compiler warnings through bogus assignments. I have mixed thoughts on
this, as to whether it is better to change function declarations than use
bogus assignments, or perhaps leave warnings intact. These warnings only occur
in GCC 3 or later.


UnAngband 0.5.4a: "A Whole Lotta Love"

### Game-play ###

- Added high-level guardians to remaining areas in campaign mode.

- Replaced fletchers with jewellers in Edoras.


### Build / Platform ###

- readdib.[ch] were old.

- Fixed definition of user_name() for Linux port.


### Bug fixes ###

- Fixed some elves that were incorrectly using the 'h' symbol.

- Disallow object recall for unknown flavored objects.

- Incorrect default note was set for object and ego inscriptions
  if there were no note.

- Fixed some bugs in room.txt

- Some dungeon names are misspelt.

- Loading an old savefile crashed the game.

- Some spell flags were not handled in spell_desc()

- You could not tonnnel cages while stuck in them.

- Some boolean variables are incorrectly set when getting bit flags.

- teleport_away() was swapping a monster and another monster or a
  player if there is one on a random place.

- A window flag for "Display room description" window was not saved.

- Fixed a minor bug about monster recall flag on OLD_DRAIN spell.

  on all kits should be removed.

- "(D) Base Delay Factor" was not displayed.

- It was possible to destroy cursed equipments.

- Fixed the bug which forbids more than 64 spells by introduciing new
  option "variant_study_more" which really allows more than 64 spells
  to be studied.  Old option "variant_more_spells" is left for

UnAngband 0.5.4: "It'll be Sangband next" (Out the door release)

### Game Play ###

- Added the ability to create a trap using any object using the 'j'am command
('S'pike in roguelike keys).

- You must now climb out of pits/chasms/spider webs/thickets/thorns, taking a
double move.

- Changed how trees are generated to reduce overhead when generating a level.

- Added hilly terrain which uses '<' graphic. This is primarily for expanded
wilderness generation, when that is implemented.

- Added shallow pits, which provide cover for monsters hiding in them.

- Allows runestones to be used from the floor now.

- Spells available on runestones are now affected by the day of the lunar
cycle.

- Fire, acid and so forth will not create smoke, clouds etc. on floors from
a monster or player spell. Traps and other terrain will create this however.

plasma or immunity to water.

you will only see monster pain messages when a monster gets to a worse 'state'
than it currently is.

- Exploding and spreading terrain now does so without visible 'blast'.

use special graphics for identified items of various sorts.

terrain.

### Build / Platform ###

- Added 'f_info.txt', 'w_info.txt' and 'misc.txt' from Zangband. These are not
currently used, but if you copy them into your Zangband lib\edit directory
(Backing up the current versions of the files), you can see an Unangband
'version' of the Zangband wilderness, using Unangband's version of the terrain
graphics. (Uses Zangband 2.7.1). This is for testing purposes and comments...

- Updated copyright notices in source.

### Game-play ###

- Shamans start having a scroll of bless weapon

Unangband 0.5.2a Bugfix release

### Game-play ###

- Bill Ferny now guards the bottom of Bree.

- The Trollshaw forest is now harder.

- Bert, Bill and Tom occur earlier in non-campaign mode.

### User Interface ###

- Added ability to redefine visual prefs using the knowledge menus (~).
This is done via a graphic user interface type setting, allowing you to
see large numbers of possible graphics to select from.

- If you specify a graphic/attr/char mapping for e.g. a potion of speed,
once you become aware of the object, it will use this mapping rather than
still using the flavour attr/char mapping. This for instance allows you
to colour all 'bad' potions/scrolls/etc. dark grey so that you don't
attempt to get them.

- The objects menu under the knowledge menu now lists the flavours of
all unknown objects, primarily so you can interact with the visuals for
these objects. This is different for Eyangband, which lists the objects
you know of, but have not found this game.

- Added reference to new web site at http://unangband.berlios.de.

- Made torches light brown, and other junk dark brown.

### Build / Platform ###

- Removed use of 'near' member of structure as used as a reserved
keyword in VC++.

### Bug fixes ###

- Actually made teleport a lot safer to use. You will not be placed in
potentially dangerous grids.

- Fixed bug where monster could end up in unsafe grids for the monster
after teleporting.

- Fixed bug where town/dungeon name and depth were displayed in wrong
part of screen if window is resized.

- Fixed some flags for various types of terrain.

- Fixed bug where learning a spell would report it as a song (Reported
 by Adam Horowitz).

- Fixed bugs so that you can escape locations where you are stuck other
than by teleporting.

- Partially fixed bug so that at least 'aware' flavoured items are
displayed with correct graphic when using graphics.

Angband 0.5.2 "I'm on fire" release

I have reorganised this changes.txt file to similar to what Eytan Zweig
 uses for Eyangband. It should be clearer what the changes are.

To see what changes have been made for previous versions, check the 
previous release (0.5.1d).

### Game-play ###

- Giant spider webs can now allow spells cast through them.

- You can now no longer recall from a dungeon to a town in a different 
location, as it was too unclear for when this case would apply.

- You can now affect doors and other terrain with bolt spells as well 
as ball spells.

- Smoke/steam removed by cold attacks (Suggested by Adam Horowitz).

- Guardians on surface levels and dungeon towns are now generated
during daytime as well  (But still only night time in surface towns).

- Statues/containers/body parts now give you some information about the
 monster when you discover them.

- Removed Create Golem spell until friendly monsters are implemented.

- Added Heavy Armoury, Heavy Weaponsmith, Runesmith and Chemist and 
added to and reorganised stores in a number of towns.

- Improved store inventories in Jewelers, Marketplace, Barracks and 
Blackmarket to be more appropriate for players at the level they will 
encounter the stores. Note that the Blackmarket in Angband will now 
generate items at a deeper level.

- If you are hidden in darkness, a lot more monsters will use light to
 see by...

- Dungeon entrances are now lit, so they are easier to find at night...

- Added King of the Wood Elves, Faramir, Boromir and Denethor, and 
reorganised some of later campaign to be a smoother transition from end
 of Moria/Isengard/Caradhras.

- Removed escorts from Tom Bombadil, and summon kin, as it felt a little
 'wrong' (Not as bad as killing him of course ;)

- Made dynamic terrain allowing forests to burn down, seas to have waves
 and various other effects, poison gas and smoke to spread and disappate.

- Added waves and wave crests to allow water to have waves in it. These
look and act like 'real' waves.

- Doors and other wooden objects now cause persistent fires, which can be
put out by bashing them.

- Teleport is now a lot safer to use. You will not be placed in
potentially dangerous grids.

- Musical instruments will now occasionally be ego items.

- Torches, lanterns, etc. now will also affect the terrain under them
as well as the monster.

- Some weapons are now 'throwing': to use them, unequip your bow or
cross-bow, and use the fire command. You will see which weapons are
available as throwing weapons. This is currently daggers, batons,
darts, javelins and spears, all potions, flasks, bottles and sling
ammunition.  Throwing weapons get a much greater range, and their
to hit and damage bonuses count for double when fired. Warning:
using the throw command will not give you these benefits.

- Slings can now fire any 'throwing' weapon, allowing you to lob
potions (Such as potions of Detonations) to much greater distances.

- Added Burning arrows and Batons.

- Potions of Death are now very expensive.


### User Interface ###

- Added ability to create html screen dumps similar to T.O.M.E. This can 
be invoked with the ] key on the main map.

- Added ability to create html screen dumps at any time using the Ctrl-
right-bracket (^]) short cut. This uses the current visual preferences 
instead of temporarily reseting these preferences to the underlying 
settings. However it has much greater flexibility, and can be used 
anytime Angband expects user interaction.

- Now use Enter to continue and ESC to restart the character generation
 process.

- Also use Enter to recall an object/monster/ego item/artifact in the
knowledge menus.

- You can now recall objects while you are looking at them. You will 
recall the monster instead if they are a monster body part or container
 or statue...

- Added option view_glowing_lite which applies special (eg torch-lit) 
lighting to boring grids that are adjacent to glowing features such as 
torches in a room. This is another 'pretty' function that may cause a 
slight performance hit, but should make those screen dumps even 
prettier.

- Updated the help files to reflect the above commands.


### Build / Platform ###

- Added readdib.c and removed angband.res to allow compilation for 
makefile.cyg


### Bugfixes ### 

- Fixed bug where archer, shaman, bard classes were getting too many 
blows.

- Fixed bug where ego items would be revealed if they were generated in
 a store, even if subsequently discarded.

- Fixed bug where scrolls of Curse Armour/ Curse Weapon effects were 
reversed.

- Fixed a bug where Bree town levels extended several levels into the 
dungeon. (Most bugs reported by Adam Horowitz for this release).

- Fix division by 0 bug with guard condition in randart generation code
 that was causing crashes at end of character generation.

- Tidied up some problems with terrain causing crasher bugs in campaign
 mode. Also fixed some logic problems.

- Trapped doors should work now.

- Fixed bug preventing creation of town in Minas Tirith.

- Fixed bug where flying/climbing monsters could walk through walls on
the surface.

- Fixed bug where outside locations could end up dark during day time.

- Using some wands from the ground, could cause problems as they could
be destroyed by their effects.

- Fixed bug preventing 'I'nspection of an object displaying anything
to the screen.

- Fixed logic bug: thrown specialists now gain their might/shots
benefits, but only with throwing weapons.

- Fixed bug where loading a deceased character would fail if it was
carrying a random artifact numbered higher than the regular artifacts.
(Reported by Adam Horowitz). This will load any affected save file.
