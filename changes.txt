Andrew Sidwell has volunteered to help out while I'm
on holiday, as a 'caretaker' rather than fully fledged
variant maintainer. E-mail him your compliments and me
your criticisim...

Unangband 0.5.1d Bugfix release
- Modified Mirkwood, the Lonely Mountain and Caradhras
to keep them a little more interesting (Finish Mirkwood
sooner, more monsters in Lonely Mountain and make
Caradhras deeper).
- Added the Dale so town available to visit during the
Battle of Five Armies.
- Marketplace now generates level 15 items.
- Scrolls of Identify and Legend Lore more common in
dungeon.

Alchemy store.

- Changed steam, smoke and acidic vapour so they do no
item damage or special damage.
- Added DROP_GOOD to stone troll uniques.
- Added CAN_CLIMB to Mirkwood monsters so they will
appear in Mirkwood.
- Floors now marked by acid, fire and water, and steam
and poison attacks result in clouds of steam or
poisonous gas. At some point in the future, clouds and
fire will need to move and disperse, as they are
static at the moment (Use DYNAMIC flag).
- Alchemist and magic shop now buy runestones.
- Monsters should now emerge from previous location,
instead of current location.
- Hallucinate and boulder attacks implemented.
- Hidden monsters can no longer be attacked.
- Trapped doors should change into a door trap type
when detected now.
- Removed duplicate entries for red and blue from
flavor.txt. Replaced with new potion flavors.
- Fixed stun display.
- Removed kobolds from monster info menu.
- Fixed bug where monsters would be noted as being able
to climb or push past other monsters, where instead this
ability was a result of fleeing or moving over rubble,
trees or webs.
- No longer gets direction if you are aware of rod
abilities, instead of needing to id it first.
- Now sense instruments.
- Always curse worthless staffs, never curse useful
staffs.
- Should always notify player and destroy object if
we release a monster from an object now.
- Reduced damage required to manipulate altars and
destroy fountains.
- Can now study from and cast from altars.
- Now learn about artifact/item activation by activating
the artifact.
- Trap disarming now depends on the power of the trap.
Power 5 traps have same difficulty as old trap difficulty.
- Now clears belt slot when creating a new character.
- Fixed problem where was not allocating space for new
artifact lore in randarts.c.
- Monsters on easy_climb locations on surface are no
longer hidden if you are inside. This primarily affects someone
fighting a monster on a tree trunk while they are under the
branches.
- Does not reveal ego item flags any more when inspecting
an identified ego item.
- Will not be notified when a monster out of sight fails to cast a
spell or teleports.
- Made innate and non-innate spells seperate. Now a monster with
a single innate spell and many spells, will use the innate spell
50% of the time, given the opportunity, and vice versa. A monster
with 1_IN_2 and both innate attacks and spells, will use a spell
or innate spell 75% of the time. At a later date, will allow
SPELL_1_IN_x and INNATE_1_IN_x flags to be specified for monsters
so that it is possible to fine tune frequency of abilities (eg
high level archers with many frequent arrow attacks, and some
miscellaneous spell abilities).
- Modifying the fast_moves code slightly, so that you rest while
running, and prevent you moving quickly on some terrain (Ice,
snow, rubble etc.)
- No longer auto-scum on surface.
- Fix display of item properties for legend lore.
- Fix notification of melee weapon and wielded equipment
properties. (Bow and missile weapon seem less critical).

- Added maps for sale at the Library at Rivendell.
- Fixed bug preventing books from stacking sometimes.
- Count usages of objects properly now.
- Travelling now requires you are recovered from any cuts,
poison, stun damage, confusion, blindness etc.
- Added back improved Lances, Tridents and Two-Handed Maces -
modified the artifact lance and tridents to match the newer
stats.
- Fixed campaign mode so victory is possible.
- Amulets of infravision should now get pval.
- Should now be able to cancel spells correctly.
- Updated Main and Makefiles to 2.9.7-alpha1, and tried to
remove LUA dependencies and add info.c. This may not be
correct as I am working from the makefile itself, with no
additional knowledge of the various makefile structures.
- Fixed display of known/lost artifacts.

Unangband 0.5.1c Bugfix release
- Fixed bug where instruments in bow slot did not provide
benefits to instrument specialists.

not correctly updating may flags in inventory.

to be passed through at once, correctly.
- Now displays information about what an object may do,
and does not do, when you 'I'nspect it.
- Wall spells now create walls of features...
- Trees, rubble and webs now take 2 turns to move through.

Unangband 0.5.1b Bugfix release
- Instruments now wield in the bow slot (Taken from ToME).
- Paladins and mages can now learn instrument style.
- Items are no longer flavoured by monster drops unless
visibly so.
- Inscribing an object with '=k' will now destroy it when
you walk over it, regardless of other inscriptions. This
prevents a bug where you are prompted to destroy an object
when you have a full inventory.
- Some fixes to various items in dungeon.
- Ego objects display in correct location now.
- Improved object spoilers to include column for object power,
this is also handy to debug problems with spell.txt file.
- Made corrections to some more objects.

Unangband 0.5.1 "'Oops. I did it again' again" release
- Reordered monsters in monster file, rendering save file
incompatible for the first time ever since Unangband released.
However, it allows use of graphics in the game, using Angband
2.9.6 pref files.
- Fixed bug with loading dungeon in campaign mode.
- Fixed bug causing visual weirdness due to tab replacement
in strings.
- Fixed bug preventing players learning spells that was
introduced in upgrade to 2.9.6.
- Fixed some minor monster changes.

Unangband 0.5.0 "This is Dedicated" release
- Updated help files to include new options.
- Restructured help files to format similar to Eyangband.
- Removed a number of monster AI options that are no longer
used.
- Made it so players descending to ground floor of tower, gets
placed inside the tower.
- Use revised knowledge code from Eyangband.
- Change auto-inscription code to use the revised knowledge
code (~) instead of the old auto-inscription menus ($). In
particular, you can (c)opy and (p)aste auto-inscriptions,
letting you very quickly configure large number of auto-
inscriptions in a manner similar to many auto-squeltch
implementations. (No "squeltching by quality" supported though).
- You can now inscribe @x* on an item, where 'x' is any action,
and that item will always be picked when you attempt to perform
that action. This is very useful in 2 circumstances: when you
want to duplicate the {SQUELTCH} inscription from many other
variants, by setting up auto-inscriptions with @k*, and when
you only have 1 stack of arrows/bolts, shots inscribed with @f*,
saves you a keypress to fire.

Unangband 0.5.0-pre1 Bugfix release
- Added more dungeons and reorganised somewhat.
- Added some more uniques to populate new dungeons.
- Removed Red Deaths (Were from Kangband anyway).
- Staves were losing to hit and damage bonuses.
- Fixed major bug with campaign mode.
- Scrolls of teleport level had incorrect s_info.txt entry
(Should have been 10).
- Made frogs slightly deeper and all toads spit at a distance.
- Loose rocks not working properly because of paranoia.
- Make metallic centipedes metallic.
- Enchant armor and enchant armor to-resist had incorrect
s_info entrys (should be 16 and 49).
- Mushroom of mana has incorrect s_info.txt entry (Should
be 20).
- Improved curing from Cure Light/Serious/Cure Critical/Cure
Mortal Wounds.
- All goblins should be HURT_LITE.
- Wooden chests only drop gold (At this depth, it is more
valuable than garbage).
- Broken cages should be MOVE and not TUNNEL.
- Upgraded much of code base to Angband 2.9.6 (This excludes
Lua however).
- Changed self knowledge code slightly.
- Removed ALLOW_OBJECT_INFO define as it is always on now.
- Added improved ability to inspect objects from Eyangband.
- Fixed long standing bug causing consistent crashing when
attempting to load a save file with a dead character.

Unangband 0.4.9h Bugfix release
- Fixed spelling of Caradhras.
- Caradhras, the Mountain now guards Caradhras.
- Some other dragon flies were accidentally green. (Reported
by Sean Lester).
- Fixed various bugs with wands.
- Added 34 additional wands.
- Made wand/staff charges depend on object level rather
than sval type.
- Removed old changes information, as this was taking a lot
of space.
- Brought back old high resistance shields/body armor.
- Changed town monster types in Bree and Rivendell.
- Rods of Lightning were doing fire damage by mistake.
- Now only apply song effects if we have a significant
energy use.
- Metallic monsters should shimmer a lot more frequently.
- Was "fixing" rod timeout really badly in save file. Now
fixing it correctly. Rods will have a recharge time now.
- Added maps to various locations to allow non-campaign
mode players to journey to some campaign locations; also
to extend campaign mode by allowing some alternate dungeons.
- Made all trees lose FRIENDS flag. They're too tough at
their depth otherwise, and never looked good placed as
FRIENDS.
- Potions of infravision now work.
- Recall is really working now.
- Cancelling scrolls/staffs etc are really working now.
- HURT_ROCK monsters should now drop bodies.
- Staff of Detect curse now working.
- Spells were displaying description twice. Fixed.
- Bug accidentally marked people as winners after killing
quest monster at bottom of a dungeon. Fixed.
- Changed it so that you have to defeat the trolls
to make it to Rivendell.
- Ghosts/other passwall creatures now correctly hiding in
terrain again.
- Tidied up frog depths and renamed a duplicate frog.
- Changed monster visibility when outside to correctly
handle monsters travelling over buildings, also visibility
at nighttime. When you are outside, you can see any
flying/climbing monster during daytime, and any flying/
climbing monster at night that is lit by torch/lantern
light only. When you are inside, you cannot see any
monster that is outside (This is a hack).
- This should stop spurious hiding/emergence messages
that you get while you are outside.
- Also prevented player from attacking monsters on the roof
of a building while they are inside it, and vice versa.
- Note the above are all fairly ugly hacks to allow some
three-dimensional movement while on the surface (Actually
2 2d planes lying on top of each other).
- Fixed a number of problems with spells, that were
preventing many spell effects and items from working
properly.
