Welcome to Gods Upsetting the Multiverse Angband (Gumband):

****************************************************************************
Our story so far...
  It is the time of the Conjunction of a Million Spheres. Your Earth is
composed almost entirely of cave-riddled mountains (which have their own
dark inhabitants, known mostly by rumour), with villages in the few fertile
valleys that exist. Except for high summer, movement and trade between the
villages is almost impossible.
  Fresh rumours begin infiltrating the villages.  Rumours about the strange,
otherworldly beings that have begun to concentrate in the vast system of
caves under the mountains.  Rumours that the forces of Chaos are gathering
in unheard of numbers (led by three Chaos Lords referred to only as "The
Sword Rulers"), somewhere deep within the Earth, preparing for a great
battle with Law, upsetting the rule of the Cosmic Balance on your plane.
  Something needs to be done.  The Balance must be restored.  Someone must
journey to the bowels of the Earth and attempt to banish these Sword Rulers
from your plane...
****************************************************************************

============================================================================
Send any and all complaints (or praise ;), patches,
makefiles, etc., to danhenry@inreach.com.
============================================================================
PLEASE NOTE: Preserving savefile compatability is *NOT* important to me. I
highly suggest you finish up your current character in your current version
before moving to this one. At the very least, monster memory could be
severely messed up between versions...
============================================================================
Thanks to all the folks in #angband and rec.games.roguelike.angband who've
put up with me, and even helped me in many cases, while I was plundering
their knowledge of C for this little project. :) So, if you've responded to
any of my posts dealing with Gumband, or C programming in general, consider
yourself thanked. :) [individual thanks will be down there in the entries
that apply]
============================================================================
Thanks also to those who've been compiling Gumband for other platforms. You
know who you are, and since it sometimes changes, I won't lay the blame in
here. ;) Just make sure to give yourself credit for the compile in the text
file you upload with your archive, 'kay?
============================================================================
Note to Windows users: Remember to change Gumband.ini to reflect the path to
\lib on your own system....
============================================================================
Note to Linux users: There may be problems with the ` macro I have defined
in .\lib\user\pref.prf (everyone should read that file, BTW), so you might
want to remove it. Also, best to check the files in linux_fix.tar.gz as they
should help Gumband work better on your system.
============================================================================
Note to all users: I can't say this enough - read this file and
.\lib\help\birth.txt! These files are kept updated and contain important
information. Plus, it'll reduce the number of questions I have to answer
over and over and over... :) Also, read ./lib/user/pref.prf and the other
files there so you can undo or change the macros I've set...
============================================================================

=====================================================================
= Gumband 2.3.2 = Last Update: 20-Jan-2010 = The Old Martian update =
=====================================================================
00) Updated version number in news.txt, defines.h
01) On the suggestion of Nick the FAngband maintainer, makefile.std
has been edited to default to the "Standard version" which supports
both X11 and curses. Anyone who compiles their own Gumband and needs
to adjust the makefile for your system, please send me the changes
needed, so you won't have to make them again for the next version.
02) Halflings would not heal a monster making a vampiric attack. This
made sense for Spectres, but not really for Halfling, so this has
been changed.
03) Mutation allowing the creation of powerful nether balls at the
cost of experience was not redrawing experience. Fixed, I hope.
04) Three new crimes, one new rumor, three new monster speech messages,
some new Warrior and Rogue level titles, some new randart names.
05) "Light Rod" as permanent light source changed to "Sheev Light", a
Moorcockian nigh-eternal light source without a name conflict with
an existing item type.
06) One new artifact: The Mirror of Truth (replaces Iron Shield of
Celegorm).
07) Monsters added: Martian ghoul, N'aal Beast, Martian Spider,
Spider-man, Great Mishassa, Argzoon, Dog-man, Rheti, Jihadoo,
Heela, Horguhl, Rhadari
08) Monsters removed: Scruffy looking hobbit, Auto-roller, Drider,
Giant flea, Ulfast, Umber hulk, Blue worm mass, Baby blue dragon,
Dark elven priestess, Mi-Go, Blink dog, Forest troll
09) Bugfix: Empress Sharadim did not have Robe of Victory chosen
drop.
10) Sreng gets a chosen drop.
11) New monster spell, replaces now unused S_DAWN. Giant summoning.
12) Gambolt player race modified slightly to make it Moorcockian
Martian cat-folk, the people of Purha. Largely a case of rewriting
description, but some minor tweaks were made.
13) Added turn count to character dump. Also, all artifacts should have
their abilities listed in dumps.
14) Added bug-fix thanks to Robert Au. Should put a band-aid on a
rare crash situation. Probably not correct solution after I get a
better grip on the object-handling code.

====================================================================
= Gumband 2.3.1 = Last Update: 08-April-2009 = Ice Mother's update =
====================================================================
Big delay because of "real life". I do expect more regular progress
through the near future. If nothing goes unexpectedly, terribly
wrong, of course, which is more likely than I would wish.
00) Updated version number in news.txt, defines.h
01) Bug fix: Human activation was producing berserking instead
of heroism.
02) Fixed typo in Malibann description
03) Missing &s in object.txt added to armors to correct description
errors.
04) A Staff of Light will now cure blindness. Effects changed in
response to a bug report by Michal Bielinski.
05) Halved the chance of a race-change polymorph effect trying to
kill the player.
06) Monster melee paralysis attacks now only add one round to
paralysis if you are already paralyzed.
07) Added a crime to crime.txt. Changed some random artifact names
and other messages in the 'file' folder. Changed a couple of item
flavors.
08) Bug fix: Character description text problems fixed.
09) Added comment to "readme.txt" noting need for updating. Did not
update it.
10) Artifacts: Halberd of Guardian changed back to a Halberd (see
renaming in 06 of 2.3.0 changes). Damage upgraded to base 5d5.
Sting replaced with the Harpoon of Urquart; removed as chosen drop
for Scruffy looking hobbits. Gondricam replaced by Cutlass of
Konrad Arflane.
11) Old "Ice phantom" replaced with "Ice Spirit". Scatha the Worm
replaced by Heurfrast. Fang, Farmer Maggot's dog replaced by Wild
Dog. Dreadmaster replaced by Ice Ghost. Smeagol replaced by Green
Scavenger. Novice ranger (group version) replaced by Ice Barbarian.
Elder thing replaced by Northern Whale. Byakhee replaced by Sperm
Whale. Strygalldwir replaced by Shipsmasher.
12) Added ARROW_FIRE, a flaming arrow attack. This was done in a
quick and easy way as a 2d6 fire attack. Ideally at some future time
it will be possible to have monsters make properly "branded" attacks
like the player can do.
13) Actually added with 2.3.0, there is a mingw32 makefile in the
source release, thanks to copx.

================================================================
= Gumband 2.3.0 = Last Update: 27-Sept-2007 = Erekose's update =
================================================================
I figure this one is big enough for minor version number change,
especially since the savefile format definitely changes with the
new mutation flags. Seriously, don't try to load an old savefile.
00) Updated version number in news.txt, defines.h
01) Various errors in monster.txt fixed.
02) Undead monsters have their nether immunity restored. Nether is
the very force of undeadness. Be happy it doesn't heal them. Player
Vampires not immune because I'm cruel and unfair that way.
03) Fixed Fhoi Moire uniques being 'G' instead of 'P'.
04) POTIONS OF DEATH TONED WAY DOWN! You won't actually die. At
least, as long as you're perfectly safe. If you drink it standing
next to a yeek, don't complain about the embarassing tombstone.
05) The Karach now has the Vadhagh Robe of Corum as its chosen drop.
(Removed Corum --> Hand of Kwll chosen.) Empress Sharadim gets the
Robe of Victory as a chosen drop.
06) Base item changes: Replaced slime mold with the ecrex, a fruit in
_The Eternal Champion_. No more eating slime molds. Lead-Filled Mace
renamed to Huge Mace (several characters wield huge maces in various
books, with no mentions of lead). Halberd renamed to Harpoon, Lance
renamed to Halberd, Scythe renamed to Lance. Feanorean Lamp
becomes Light-Rod. Mithril Plate Mail replaced by Ivory Armour.
Treasures revised to eliminate mithril, adamantite.
07) Monsters removed: Orc shaman, Orc captain, Hardened warrior, Balrog,
Father Dagon, Seraph, Hill orc, Grima the Wormtongue, Angel, Black orc,
Moon beast, Wereworm, Silent watcher, Archangel, Gorbag the Orc Captain,
Cave orc, Dhole, Quiver slot, Azog (King of the Uruk-Hai),
Formless spawn of Tsathoggua, Great Cthulhu, Grid bug, Grape jelly,
Greater hell-beast (level 22), Ungoliant, The Emperor Quylthulg, Vecna
08) Monsters added: Knight, Captain, Marshal, Many-coiled Serpent, Melusine,
Snowbear, Seal-beast, Scaly Heron, Silver Warrior, Musimon, Enfield,
Ice Wyvern, Sea-stag, Opinicus, Bagwyn, Cockfish, Amphisbaena, Satyr,
Man-lion, Cockatrice, Archduke Balarizaaf, Degenerate Mabden,
Dragon Lizard, Smoke Snake, Firedrake, Empress Sharadim, Dead Flamadin
09) Monsters modified: Basilisk, Ornithopter (death explosion now damage
24 FIRE, radius reduced to 2), Chimaera, Wyvern, Griffon (including
changing the spelling to "Griffin" to match the mention in _The Silver
Warriors_), Mantacore (which also gets renamed to "Manticora"), Grand
Master of Chaos (PUNCH attacks changed from CHAOTIC to STUN),
Cerberus (BA_DARK changed to BR_DARK), "Creeping adamantite coins" became
"Ruby Mimics" and "Adamantite golem" became "Ruby Golem" to match new
treasure drops.
10) Artifact changes: Arvedui replaced with Full Plate Armour of Erekose.
Orcrist replaced by the Huge Mace of Arjavh. Kanajana slightly tweaked.
The Mithril Chain Mail 'Belegennon' replaced with Ivory Armour of Alisaard.
The Set of Gauntlets 'Paurhach' replaced with the Robe of Victory.
The Vadhagh Robe of Corum was lacking see invisible because I had
assumed it would carry over from the base object, but it didn't - fixed.
Missing break was causing Scythe of Death activation to
accompany Sling of Medhbh activation - fixed.
11) AURA_POIS monster flag added so basilisk can poison those who dare to
make contact, as legend has it.
12) New player races: Spectres are replaced by Halflings, living humanoids
from the Ghost Worlds, who can walk through wall (without the damage a
Spectre took) but lack some of the bonuses of a Spectre. Elves are replaced
by the Eldren (who resist Time) and Hobbits are replaced with Oager Uv.
13) Half-Giant Extra Might ability now stacks with Extra Might on a bow. A
50th level Half-Giant Archer with a shooter of Extra Might will get three
boosts to the multiplier (e.g. a sling would become x5 up from x2). Race
and class bonus should both now change the displayed multiplier.
14) Added two new values to the player structure, mpsyche and cpsyche, to
create a new player attribute, psyche, which powers racial powers and
player-activated mutations. Psyche gets some increases with leveling and
Beastmen get double psyche. Psyche recharges over time. It works a bit like
an artifact "time out", but covers multiple abilities. Restructed racial
and mutant activations.
15) Vampires now increase hunger faster if they are bleeding (this effect
is double the effect on hunger of regenerating). Vampiric draining changed
from activation to extra melee attack and unified with the vampiric
mutation. New Vampire power is summon bats. Vampires get a slight bonus
over mutants with vampiric fangs in that true Vampires can drain a monster
even if it is already dead. This was a bug, but I like it as a feature, so
it stays.
16) Various minor textual tweaks.
17) Monster criticals now pass a 1 in 20 check instead of old check for
95%+ of possible damage and STUN added to monster blow types for the
melee stunners. This is not a possible effect of a CHAOTIC attack at the
moment; after some experience with it in play, it may be added to the
possible CHAOTIC effects.
18) Eldren now have self-knowledge as a racial power (far more appropriate
for them than for humans). Humans now can invoke Heroism effect.* Also, the
Melnibonean demon summoning is improved to have only 1 in 8 summoned demons
be hostile (down from 1 in 3).
* - Due to a stupid bug, humans actually invoking Berserk in this version.
19) Easy_open, filter_identify, and show_damage options are now on by default.
20) New set of mutation flags added. Major revision of mutations with many
new mutations, modified mutations, deleted mutations.
21) Changed extra melee attacks from mutations to not include damage bonus.
Instead, there is a damage multiplier based on level. (Also, one new
mutation has a built-in elemental brand that applies to the full damage,
since it is all base damage.) Monks, being skilled in fighting with their
own bodies as their weapons, gain a 50% damage bonus with extra attacks
when fighting bare-handed.
22) Revision of racial bias among shopkeepers. This was mostly to account
for the new races, but there are numerous other changes.
23) Moved display of damage done to monster by player to mon_take_hit(),
which is the logical place to do it anyway. This causes damage done by
magic to display now, although it has a side effect of displaying (0 dam)
for attacks that do only effects and no real damage.
24) Set all races to have no classes marked as inappropriate in character
creation screen.
25) Fixed repeat command for mindcrafting.

================================================================
= Gumband 2.2.4  = Last Update: 10-Jun-2006 = The Corum update =
================================================================
01) Updated birth.txt entry for Half-Giants (forgot to do for 2.2.3)
Also, Extra Might ability should now display on character screen.
(Displayed multiplier on bow will still not reflect this.) Note that
this does not stack with Extra Might on a bow.
02) Removed Amberian "Courts of Chaos" reference from demon summoning
messages.
03) Added "repeat last command", naively copying from 2.9.3 source. This
will doubtless prove buggy in some way, but is a much needed UI improvement.
Gumband repeat command is 'n'. Bug is that it is not working for either
mutations/racial powers or for mindcrafting, both of which need to be
rewritten anyway.
04) Removed class/realm specific .prf files (which will become obsolete
once I really get making changes anyway). They reflect the original
maintainers biases and may not suit all player and increase download. Also,
without documentation, they result in undocumented behaviors.
05) Antiques Store now charges normal price, as half was abuseable (high
Charisma meant you could buy and sell to Antiques Store at profit).
06) Aggravation no longer makes pets hostile. This should mean that
Stormbringer's activation should now actually be useful.
07) Removed extraneous space in a_info.txt in Runestaff entry. Minor
corrections in r_info.txt.
08) Berserking was negating not only magical bonus to AC on armor, but
spell protections including the clearly physical "Stone Skin". Now timed
spells grant AC after berserking sets +AC to zero so they will be effective.
However, I suspect mutations granting armor will not be applied when berserk.
I'll worry about this when I get around to rewriting mutation.c.
09a) Monsters Removed: Greater Hell-Beast (level 79), Pukelman, Mithril golem,
Mirkwood spider, Anti-paladin, Shagrat, Mummified Orc, Sangahyando of Umbar,
Creeping mithril coins, Greater hell-beast (level 1), Giant fruit fly,
Star-spawn of Cthulhu, Night-gaunt, Groo, Bull Gates, Santa Claus, Mongbat,
Shelob, Greater hell-beast (level 31), Black Knight, Greater hell-beast
(level 96), Cherub, Barrow wight, Giant skeleton troll, Golfimbul, Warg,
Azrael, Atlas, Greater hell-beast (level 47), The Witch-King of Angmar,
Shoggoth, Ice troll, Khamul the Easterling, Great Wyrm of Matter,
Pseudo dragon, Lich, Saruman, Fasolt the Giant, Lo Wang, Newt,
Hastur the Unspeakable, Thuringwethil, the Lernean Hydra, Skull druj,
Eye druj, Hand druj, and the Phoenix
09b) Monsters Added: Crimson Cow, Bronze Flyer, Sea Giant, Blandhagna,
Denledhyssi, Pony Tribesman, Allomglyl Bat, Earl Moidel, Brikling, Ragha-da-Kheta,
Flamelands Beast, Sefano, Shefenhow, King Lyr-a-Brode, The Dog, The Horned Bear,
Great Black Bird, Freenshak, Ghanh, Chaos Packling, Karmanal (of Zert), Chaos Sea,
Bear Soldier, Chaos Army Dog, Ertil, Little Demon, Urleh, Duke Teer, Flying Serpent,
Prince Gaynor the Damned, Ghoolegh, Ice Phantom, Pine Warrior, Sidhi Bull,
Ynys Scaith Dragon, Malibann, Sactric, Calatin, The Karach, Rabbit, Balahr,
Kerenos, Rhannon, Goim, Sreng, Bress, Arek
09c) Monsters Edited: Shool-an-Jyvan, Mutilator, Xiombarg*, Mabelrode*,
Earl Glandyth-a-Krae, Hound of Kerenos
(* - Description tweaks only. Saving Arioch revision for the Elric series.)
10) Item Changes: began reworking armor names from *D&D naming to armors Moorcock
actually mentions, including some exotic types. Elven cloaks replaced with Vadhagh
robes. Spear of Hagen replaced with Spear of Mag-an-Mag. Cloaks of Aman renamed to
Cloaks of the Shalafen. Dirks changed to Poniards. Armour of Elvenkind renamed to
Armour of Tanelorn. Elven Cloak of Thingol replaced with Vadhagh Robe of Corum.
Edited the Hand of Kwll, the spear "Bryionak" and Retaliator. Pair of Sandals
of Hermes replaced with the Sling of Medhbh of the Long Arm. "Nature Bane" replaced
with Slaughter Axe of Goffanon. Traitor replaces Glamdring.
11) New "Vadhagh" syllables for random Vadhagh, Melnibonean, Nhadragh and Sidhi
names.
12) Text data files changed to more descriptive names.
13) New monster flag: AURA_COLD, adding cold auras similar to existing fire and
electric auras.
14) Replaced Half-Orc player race with Nhadragh. Sidhi replace Half-Titans. Humans
get a +5 to melee and missiles, just to make them a little less pathetic.
15) Hisak Sunthief is now the best Weapon Smith shopkeeper.


==================================================================
= Gumband 2.2.3  = Last Update: Jan-18-2004 = The Hawkmoon update=
==================================================================
01) Replaced "porcupines" with "hedgehogs". (More Euromythic.)
02) Changed three rumors, added three new crimes, gave Weaponmasters their
own level titles, and other bits of text tweaking.
03) Various compiler warning messages heeded and code tidied.
04) Old Pattern Vault slots filled with some Chris Weisiger vault designs.
05) Antiques Store no longer gives *ID* info while window shopping. However,
prices are now halved instead of doubled, so every sale is a steal!
06) Messages for backstabbing stunned or confused monsters no longer
the same as message for backstabbing fleeing monsters.
07) Player should now start with full mana.
08) Updated to reflect my new email address.
09) Revised monsters: Baragoon, Guardian of Soryandum, Warrior of the Mad
God, Charki, Warrior of the Dawn, Ymryl, Baron Kalan of Vitall,
Meliadus of Kroiden (revisions are generally fairly small, with descriptions
being modified to be more of what one would see and less plot point recaps)
10) Replaced monsters: Robin Hood --> Rekner, Snaga --> Warmaiden of the Mad God,
Barney --> Agonosvos, Olog-Hai --> Battle beast, Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath
--> Mutant war jaguar, Dark Elven Lord --> Mountain beast, Uruk-Hai --> Water
beast, Gnome mage --> Pool beast, Mumak --> Atlantic horror, Neekerbreeker -->
Horned horse, Short Sword (2d3) --> Brand, the Horned Horse, Dorian Hawkmoon
--> Taragorm, Master of the Palace of Time, Grip --> Garko, Ugluk -->Arnald of
Grovent, Ghoul --> Ocean ghoul, Ewok --> Scarlet flamingo, Lagduf --> White
bull, Frumious bandersnatch --> Marsh bear, Software bug --> Ornithopter,
Potion Mimic --> Mountain giant, Bolg, Son of Azog --> Barkyos, the Giant
11) Changes to items: "Mundwine" has become the axe "of Mikosevaar" and
slays animals rather than evil; Isildur's armor is now that of Jet and Gold;
"Celeborn" replaced with all new "Mad Yisselda's Armour"; upgraded activation
of Red Amulet and somewhat lengthened recharge time, while lowering PVAL to 3;
minor tweaking of the Sword of the Dawn; Great Axe of Durin is now "of Orkney",
but name change only; Arkenstone replaced by Runestaff; Cesti of Fingolfin
replaced with Cesti of Brass; "Terror Mask" renamed "of Meliadus" (it's already
his chosen drop) and tweaked
12) Half-Giants given additional background entries for mountain giants. Instead
of resisting shards, they now have intrinsic Extra Might. Height and weight have
been lowered and made more variable. Changes based on Oladahn, Dorian Hawkmoon's
half-giant companion.

=============================================
= Gumband 2.2.2  = Last Update: 17-Jun-2003 =
=============================================
The big change here is the new maintainer. I've tweaked some flavor text
already, including some level titles, but I won't be tracking that level
of detail. Real changes follow:

01) Applied easy open patch supplied by Riivo Mägi. Default is off. It is
under "Disturbance Options".
02) Replaced linux_fix.tar.gz with newer version from Joseph William Dixon.
03) Ripped out Pattern Vaults and supporting code. Goodbye Amberism.
04) Reduced monster healing from RBE_VAMP attacks as suggested by JWD, but
also reduced healing when Hold Life worked for consistency.

=============================================
= Gumband 2.2.1b = Last Update: 28-Aug-2002 =
=============================================
01) Removed the named Slime Molds, a joke that was boring about 2 versions
after it entered Gumband. :)
02) Pick-axes and shovels will no longer be generated in the Antiques Store.
03) Extra blows and extra speed no longer boost object prices to the
stratosphere...
04) Quest monsters with the ESCORT flag will no longer have their escorts
suppressed.

=============================================
= Gumband 2.2.1a = Last Update: 22-Jul-2002 =
=============================================
01) Added Elemental pits. [thanks to Antimatter for the idea, and to Kieron
Dunbar for the help with the implementation]
02) Added Ethereal Dragon pits (Dark/Light breathers).
03) The dice for melee damage the Sword Rulers deal have been changed to
d3's across the board. Total damage is unchanged. (original dice were d15's
for Mabelrode, d14's for Xiombarg, and d13's for Arioch)
04) NEW OPTION: "heavy_pseudo". Pseudo-ID type is no longer based on class.
Instead, if this option is TRUE (the default), your character will have
'heavy' pseudo-ID and will therefore sense {average}, {special}, etc.... If
off, you will only sense {good} and {cursed}.
05) Changed the small_levels option. Now, if on, *all* non-town levels will
be 3x3 panels ([0,0] to [2,2] when <L>ooking around) instead of having only
the occasional level be of random, smaller dimensions.
06) Increased the damage (more than doubled) from Arcane magic's "Ball
Lightning" and "Poison Gas" spells.
07) High-Magi who choose Sorcery as their realm now get a Wand of Magic
Missiles as part of their normal, non-Quick-Start equipment.
08) NEW STORE: Added the Antiques Store, which only stocks random artifacts
and which only buys artifacts (random or standard). It is represented in the
town by a violet '0'. It buys at normal price, but sells at x2 the normal
price. All of its owners have a 30000au purse.

======================================================================
= Gumband 2.2.0d = Last Update: 18-May-2002 = Bugfix release, mainly =
======================================================================
01) Changed how extra dice on ego-items and artifacts are calculated again.
See object2.c and artifact.c for details. In short, the number of extra dice
is again as rare as it was in v2.2.0a. Extra dice for random artifacts is
also that rare. Ego-items and randarts can also have extra dice sides, which
are slightly more common than extra dice. Ammunition can only have the
number of dice increased, at the same rarity as above. [thanks to Antimatter
and Qlzqqlzup of #angband for their help squashing the bug this caused :]
02) Upon death, all items in your equipment and inventory will be
*Identified* so that all of your resistances will be shown in a dump made
upon character death.
03) Steel Shields are now a bit lighter than their iron counterparts, just
as Steel Helms are lighter than Iron Helms.

=============================================
= Gumband 2.2.0c = Last Update: 17-Apr-2002 =
=============================================
01) Holy Defenders were too common. They are now generated on a 1-in-10
chance when a normal Defender would be chosen. Also, like Defenders, Holy
Defenders have a chance for gaining Resist Poison...
02) Probing now reveals *all* of a monster's flags, including spells.
03) If you choose to play a High-Mage with Sorcery *and* you choose the
Quick Start option, you will begin the game with a Wand of Magic Missiles in
addition to the normal Quick Start bonuses.
04) Altered the messages for the CHAOS_GIFT mutation - they're not Chaos
deities, they're Chaos Lords...
05) Beware! Mabelrode the Faceless now moves at +40 speed! Xiombarg now
moves at +30. Arioch remains at +20.
06) Rearranged the spell macros in .\lib\user\Death.prf and
.\lib\user\Rogue.D a bit.
07) Astral characters with the Stair Creation spell can no longer create
down stairs on dungeon level 97 (thus being able to reach Arioch) without
visiting the town first.
08) Created the word_of_recall() function [in spells3.c] to get rid of
unnecessary duplication... [the code appeared 7 or so times]
09) New monster blow and effect flag: CHAOTIC. A monster with one of these
will have a randomly generated attack method (claw, tentacle, drool, etc.)
or effect (fire, disenchant, confuse, etc.) each time it hits.
10) Monster gender is now correctly displayed when performing a TONGUE or
TENTACLE attack.
11) The 'Mind Blast' Trump spell, mutation and Mindflayer racial ability,
plus Mindcrafter's 'Neural Blast', are now 0-radius ball spells instead of
bolt spells.
12) New monster blow effect: RBE_VORPAL. If you aren't Reflecting and don't
resist Shards, such attacks will *always* cut you.
13) While the player is Blessed, they get the effect of having Slay Evil if
their melee weapon (or while fighting bare-handed as a Monk) doesn't already
have it.
14) The character's Tunneling skill is now shown in the skills section of
the character sheet. [skill must be greater than 40+d1600 to dig through
granite, 20+d800 to dig through quartz, and 10+400 to dig through magma,
checked each turn of digging]

=============================================
= Gumband 2.2.0b = Last Update: 26-Feb-2002 =
=============================================
01) Added the display of resistance and ability flags (the lower half of the
'Chh' screen) to the character dump.
02) Poisonous hits from monsters and traps (floor and chest) now last as
long as the poison from the mushroom/potion of Poison and GF_POIS effects.
03) During point-based generation of a character, you can now stop assigning
points even when you have points left over.
04) Damage dealt in melee by one monster against another has been tripled.
05) Extra dice on ego-items (but not random artifacts or missiles) are now

63) Potions of *Enlightenment* also identify *every* object on the level.

a good object becoming 'great' is now 25%.
68) Protection from Evil is now more effective and can affect creatures
deeper than level 50.
69) Failure rates for spellcasting are adjusted as follows:
   Wearing gloves (without Free Action or a Dexterity bonus) for mage-type
      spellcasters (+15%)
   Being encumbered by heavy armour [penalty to fail equal to half of the
      amount of mana you lose for heavy armour]
   Priests wielding a non-blessed edged weapon (+15%)
   Being Berserk (+25%)
   Being stunned (+15%/+25%)
70) Characters suffering any of the conditions above can no longer get a 0%

and .\src\cmd5.c for the details.

                    ####### Known Bugs #######

 The display of damage done needs some cleanup. Currently it reports
 (0 dam) when running at least some effects that do not do actual damage
 and really in these cases it should just display nothing.

 There are too many potions in the game at the moment, so a few potions
 cannot be generated via debug mode's item creation menus since the list
 runs out of symbols fairly quickly. It is not a priority to fix.

 If you look through the entire monster list ['/' then CTRL-a] while the
 'know all monster info' cheat is active, you will see the occasional blank
 monster (ie, The ('')/(''): [(r)ecall, ESC]). This is because there are
 still empty slots in r_info.txt, which I will eventually fill.

 Sometimes, completely at random, the Roguelike option will set itself to
 true upon startup. I have no idea why... [hasn't happened in quite a while
 as of 06-Dec-01]

 I've been noticing that sometimes there won't be as many quest-monsters on
 a level as there are supposed to be, meaning that a quest can't be finished
 that trip. :( I think KILL_BODY got rid of them? There's no check for
 QUESTOR (or UNIQUE) status for KILL_BODY's effect in the original code, so
 it might very well be the problem... I've added a check, so it might be
 fixed - if this bug crops up in this version, someone please mail me, 'kay?

 Sometimes aggravate_monsters (via scrolls, Rogue thefts, etc., but not the
 permanent attribute) doesn't wake up sleeping monsters. Noticed it
 happening on two creatures so far: the Mangy looking leper and the Battle-
 scarred veteran. Some games it'll wake them up, some games it won't. :(

 Random artifact amulets and rings that are of a type that starts with the
 EASY_KNOW flag will be automatically identified if you've previously ident-
 ified the base type of ring or amulet. Not really worth fixing, IMHO.

 If an object has a random ability (resistance, power, or sustain), it will
 reroll the ability and sometimes lose the ability. So don't Brand a
 Defender if you need that confusion resistance it's giving you! :) I can't
 think of any solution to preserve the xtra info...

 Also, if monster is hit by a GF_FORCE effect while standing directly in
 front of a 1-grid thick wall, or a door, or whatever, it will be pushed
 through to the other side. (see, starting around lines 2536 and 4000,
 spells1.c for details - I'm stumped as how to fix it: any solutions
 gratefully accepted)

 Finally got around to marking all the compiler warnings (that I get with
 gcc v3.02) in the source. Just search for '/* warning:'. Anyone who can fix
 them, mail me. These are just the ones that '-Wall' show. The ones given by
 the full '-W -Wall -pedantic' are too numerous to mark off. :)

 When generating a point-based character in non-Maximize mode, some
 combinations (like Gambolt Beastmaster) can reach a maximum of 18/110 for a
 stat. This is not good. :(

 Sometimes when a friendly/pet monster summons a Unique, that Unique will be
 friendly despite code in process_monster() to prevent that from happening.

## Sometimes, due to the huge number of randarts created by the Antiques
 Store, there are times that artifacts without names will be generated.

## FIXED: Monsters standing beside an outer dungeon wall when hit into the
 wall by a GF_FORCE should now only be severely crushed as normal instead of
 disappearing off of the level.
