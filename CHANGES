This is a summary of major changes made to Xygos by release.
For changes pulled in from Vanilla, see changes.txt.
For more detail, see the git history.

Xygos 0.0.2
===========

Much bug fixing.
Add "general player flags" (can be present on equipment, or as a temporary effect).
Add "carried flags" (object flags that take effect when an item is carried, not equipped).
Add a body type (as in body.txt) per player race.
Adds cyberware: legs and arms, and a shop to install it (you can't do it elsewhere, usually).
Also adds a "Cyborg" extension (where you start with random cyberware).
Removes rings and amulets and much medieval arms and armor, with a few replacements.
Rods are now Gadgets. 

Xygos 0.0.1
===========

Renamed as Xygos 0.0.1 (so it should be able to be installed alongside V).
Pulled in most of V 4.2.2.
Add factions (visible in shop greetings, affecting quality and amount of shop loot).
Sticky curses (for now, only on lamps - and the curse lets go when the lamp runs out of power.)
No more hard-coded limits on the number or length of flavor names.
Curses are now described as "faults", remove-curse as "repair".
Multiple towns. No wilderness, but airports to travel between them. One has a full size dungeon,
	the others have minidungeons. They each have their own level layout and array of stores.
Staffs are now Devices.
Soft cap XP gain in a single turn (usually by !oExp) - each level past the first gained halves the
	remaining experience. A cl1 !oExp still gives 8 levels, and normal monster kills shouldn't care.
Store items with a rarity (for e.g. rare heal items along with the usual CCW)
Scrolls are now Cards (and are 'run', and can be used in the dark but not while blind, and the
	Bookseller is renamed)
Ego and artifact generation has been redone. In both cases, the first step is to determine whether
	an ego or artifact should be generated - and only then to find a suitable base item. This gets
	rid of dependencies on base item levels that produced unexpected results (e.g. Ringil being
	more common at lower depth, just because it's based on a longsword). The probabilities are
	also calculated differently, getting rid of (or at least much reducing) the large steps in
	ego and artifact probability that were seen as other egos and artifacts went in and out of
	level.
More interactions with stores.
	You can put an item on layaway, pay to turn over stock, pay more to replace the owner, pay
	more again to buy the store yourself - or try to steal stuff (risking a fight) or just pick
	a fight yourself. That's the other way to own a store (and so it usually doesn't end well).
	Or you can ask if the owner has anything that needs doing - that is, a quest.
Quests:
	AKA tasks - ask a store owner what needs doing and you will be pointed to a > into a special
		level. Optional, but recommended (there's a lot of loot and other rewards).
	The "Soldier, Sailor, Chef, Pie" quest (Fetch a stolen card - but there's an alternative
	way to complete this)
	The "Msing Pills" quest (return the pills from a Pacman-like maze)
	The "Whiskey Cave" quest (return bottles from the back of a volcanic cave)
	The "Rats" quest (kill all the (breeding) rats)
Runes are now Icons. "Some equipment has unusual properties, signified by icons. At one time their
    meaning was supposed to be obvious, but now they might as well be mystic runes for all the
    sense they make - however, once you have discovered what an icon means you can assume that it
    has the same meaning wherever else you see it."
Extensions: Like race/class. You can be for example a Human Mutant Soldier - "Mutant" extends
	Human (or other races), giving mutations at birth, more later etc.
All old races besides Human removed. Added Time-Lord and Android. Time-Lords regenerate on death
	(sometimes) and at higher level can regen at any time (dropping them healed in town). There's
	a maximum of 12 regens, but a level limit for each and it's always chancy even if you reach
	level 50 before using your first. Androids can't eat (they use batteries) or take extensions,
	or mutate.
Radiation as a damage type, replacing nether. Fallout as a terrain type, and water. Both hurt,
	like lava, although water only does so if you are too heavily loaded to swim (for most @s:
	Androids can't swim)
Abilities, Talents, Mutations:
	These all involve a player flag, but with an additional ability structure attached which can
	add flags, change stats etc. A talent can be bought (some only at birth, some later) with
	talent points. Some are class specific (for skill with guns, for example). Mutations are
	normally acquired randomly (from a pill, or radiation) and may be purely -ve, +ve or (most
	often) a mixed blessing. All of these are described generically as abilities.
Techniques:
	These are the replacement for spells. Books don't exist as physical objects, but are retained
	as an abstraction describing a set of techniques. Realms have also gone.
	These could be derived from class/race, or equipment etc. They have a % fail (much as before),
	but as SP has been removed, the mana cost has been replaced by HP and/or a timed cooldown.
Burden speed penalty has changed. You can't pick up more than 4x your weight limit (the point at
	which you get -1), and it increases exponentially (-10 at 2x your limit, -40 at 3x, -160 at
	4x). 
Classes replaced with Soldier, Marksman, Tourist etc.
Bows are now Guns.
Hunger has been tweaked (being hungry is harmless, but being weak is worse).
Printers: An item which with blocks of metal can be used to create items from it.
Lamps: replaced with a mix of rechargeable torches, one-time glowsticks etc and lightables. There
	is a plain wax candle, but the main point of this is the dynamite, flare etc. - special effects,
	hidden by a flavor.
Hitdie tweaked so that while each level's HP gain is random, the sum is (for a given race/class) fixed.
	This means that "life rating" doesn't exist any more.
Belts (new slot, armor type)
A soft time limit. After a few days nastier monsters start to show up in the town, and if you really
	drag your feet stores will start to be destroyed. Dungeon levels get more dangerous, too. This
	should help make the multi-towns less cheesy (there's plenty of time for even quite a grindy
	playstyle, but you will quickly see penalties if you always jet about looking for more loot)
Cash items replaced with more interesting items and should always be described as cash, not gold.
Negative HP:
	This doesn't always kill you immediately (though it can). You don't heal and statuses don't time out,
	you lose 1 HP per turn and suffer bad effects (XP and stat loss).
New stats: Charisma and Speed. CHR is much cheaper, speed more expensive at birth. Speed works by giving you
(stat - 10) to speed, so a maximum of +30. This makes it easier to get early, harder later (but probably
needs balancing).
Added the Zorbus rooms, as a new vault class. (No special monsters and items as interesting rooms do - they
	are just unusual shapes, so they can be used more frequently especially as there are over 1100 of them!)
Some interesting foods

Forked from 4.2.1 tip around Jan 1 2021.
