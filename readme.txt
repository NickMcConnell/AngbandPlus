Angband-tr 0.1
==============
Patched version of Angband 4.1.0.  Angband, [tr]agic view.

The idea behind the tr patch is that you find all lives valuable, 
and because of that you are trying to kill Morgoth, for messing up 
the world so that monsters are your enemies.  Your player character 
incurs sorrow ("apparent sorrow", with the "AS" stat on screen) for 
killing monsters, which they then have to process by spending time 
away from monsters.  There's also a hidden sorrow that builds up 
every turn the player has some apparent sorrow, and which doesn't
begin to go away until they have 0 AS.  Warnings show up of hidden
sorrow, which the player must heed.  If not, hidden sorrow can
build up to the point that the player character burns out, ending
the game.

This makes the game more difficult, but as a compensation, it's
possible now to "deeply terrify" monsters by hitting them hard 
enough or when they have low enough health (like when in Vanilla, 
monsters "flee in terror").  Deeply terrified monsters run away
and do not cast spells or fire projectiles, and they do not become
unterrified.  This causes only a token amount of AS.

The patch is not necessarily balanced, which is partially a feature.
It's supposed to be unfair to the player and not completely fun to 
play.  But if you want to change it, look in the patchdoc directory
for instructions how to retune the patch.
