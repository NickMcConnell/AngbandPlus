
GSNband 1.0

A new and (hopefully) interesting extended variant of ZAngband

GSNband is named after its author (that's me :). It is based on ZAngband
2.2 and aims at enhancing it with a large number of features found in
other *bands (especially O, S, J, Kam). It has been build and tested in
DOS using gcc 2.7.3, but I think it should work under other systems
too (makefiles weren't changed much).

See ../lib/help/version.txt for a list of people who helped me with
playtesting, porting and enhancing the game with new features.

This is version 1.0, which is hopefully a stable and matured game. I'll
continue the development, of course, as new ideas are constantly unearthed
and put into practice.

Savefiles from earlier versions of GSNband are not compatible with this
release.


Features of version 0.1.0 (finished 1.11.98, not released)

* Extended recall patch
* Blood of Life patch (a potion that allows you to cheat death once)
* Infravision mutation improves it by random amounts
* Golems have better histories
* Golems have -10 to speed (duh)
* Mages have trouble wielding anything but daggers and quarterstaffs
* Chaos Warriors have trouble wielding anything that is not chaotic.
  They start with a chaotic broad sword, though.
* Monks have two new techniques at higher levels (just liked their names,
  I guess)
* Chaos Warriors got better sensing (similar to rogues)
* 'great' replaces 'excellent' in many places (for consistency; the flag
  is called DROP_GREAT)
* Added a bunch of new monsters, mainly from Kamband (aquatic ones) - a
  few are from the M&M RPG series (golems mainly). 'x' are eXtra-terrestrial
  aliens; they may seem familliar, too... 950 monsters in total
* Unfair monsters (mainly at low levels - too powerful or too easy to
  farm)
* Monsters resistant (half damage) or immune (not 0 damage, just VERY
  little) to various types of weapons
* FHotA are not undead (why should they?)
* Monsters like Great Wyrm of Balance, who were both good and evil, are
  now neither (it would make no sense with the lack of factual player
  alignment). All paladins (except anti, of course) are good
* Monster spoilers now mention the AQUATIC, CAN_SWIM, CAN_FLY and the
  new flags
* Neutral sex (don't ask me what's the use...)
* Damage dice of arrows and weapons can get enhanced sometimes (O)
* Pernament protection from evil for priests at level 50 (O)
* Various classes get extra shots with various weapons (O)
* Monsters harder to hit in trees, extra vulnerable if swimming (O)
* "Seeker" sling bullets in place of peebles
* Chaos fog as terrain (may corrupt you, so beware!)
* Weird attacks (ego items only, no race has such an intrinsic) - more
  deadly compared to Kam
* Sanity (from Kam) - sanity draining also accompanies brain smashing,
  and may be inflicted by angry deities. Low-level monsters that cause
  insanity are considered unfair. Added ego-items of Insanity
* Rogues can steal money from monsters (from O), adjusted this to player's
  experience level
* Gods (from Kam), although without sacred and hated monsters. Praying can
  result in four outcomes: reward, "leave me alone", warning and deadly
  retaliation. Chaos Warriors cannot worship gods (they have their patrons).
  Gods code has been tweaked to make them less deadly if you neglect
  to sacrifice
* Thrown weapons - not fully implemented (O)

Features added in 0.1.1 (finished 6.11.98)

* Golems now have their starting speed penalty based on INT. INT of 18
  eliminates the penalty altogether (but no positive bonuses are possible)
* Amber-specific monsters and uniques removed. Eldritch horrors and
  their spawn removed (except Cthulu and his minions, hmmm...) Monster
  list renumbered (849 monsters now)
* Artifacts returned to their original names. Dunedain come back in place of
  Amberites. "Straight Road" replaced the Pattern
* "Weapons of Valinor" replaced Pattern weapons
* Gods got the names of Valar. "God" replaced with "deity" to be non-sexist.
  The "Elder gods" are now the Deep Ones, culminating with Cthulu opposing
  Iluvatar
* Luck (from S). Luck influences saving throws and item generation, as well
  as the effects of praying. Luck is not generally known to the player
  (even when enlightened via the potion, was fixed in 0.1.2)
* Added the NOMISS, SAMESPD monster flags, HALLU, LOSE_LUC, HUNGER
  attacks (the HUNGER attack is currently not used by any monster)
* Better arena levels (floor is mostly water or chaos fog)
* Persistent dungeons (from K)
* Black Breath (saps experience and stats occasionally, can be cured
  by eating athelas). Weapons of Morgul now confer this
* Hunger shown in percent on the second player info screen (actually 99%
  means you're almost full, but it's called 'Hunger' for short. Sorry for
  the confusion)

Features added in 0.1.2

* Code brought into partial conformity with Z 2.2.1
* HURT_FIRE and HURT_COLD flags implemented. You will, however, only learn
  about the effects when casting a spell (not when attacking with a weapon
  of Burning/Freezing)
* Rings of Sustaining and Resistance
* Groo is a 'T' now, since he's a troll (I presume)
* You can no longer kick aquatic monsters in the ankle
* Bashing an altar unsuccesfully decreases your grace (if you have any) to
  prevent bashing abuse (bash, heal, bash, until the altar is converted)
* Better summoning traps, spiked pits may activate the Black Breath
* Spell blasts from angry deities now work correctly, but extracting
  of deity name for the tombstone doesn't (you get things like 'killed
  by a Player' or similar :)
* Luck level can be known via the Potion of Self Knowledge, which is
  *way* more common now (level 10 item), and can be bought in the
  alchemy shop, too (this is a provision for future frequent luck changes
  and the need for the player to check it rather regularly)
* Item hitpoints (from K), only base damage rolled with a weapon is
  substracted from HPs (prevents breaking of Daggers of Extra Attacks after
  one round of powerful blows); for warriors, this is additionally divided
  by two (making for the fact that warriors can't use much else to damage
  monsters, unlike magical classes)
  This means you can take around 50-100 hits with a weapon (better weapons
  usually get more average hits, but the progression isn't extreme). Of
  course the damage you do with those ~100 hits depends on your other
  equipment and stats
  Edged weapons are the best in this respect, followed by maces and
  polearms. To balance this, many monsters resist swords, while polearms
  can get unopposed through almost anything (including many high-level
  monsters)
* Scrolls of Repair, which can be bought in the alchemy shop, allow you
  to wonderfully renew your weapon (this *is* magic, after all...), so
  carry a supply of them just in case and check the weapon (the I key)
  sometimes for signs of overuse
* Tactics a l'ADOM, nine levels. Tactics influences AC, to-hit, to-dam,
  stealth and saving throws (tactics is changed by pressing 't' at the
  character screen)
* New cheat option, allowing the player to be invulnerable to physical
  and most spell attacks which reduce HPs
* Two new wizard options: outfit the player (gives some great goodies
  as inventory), and shuffle the stores.  Assigned to O and S keys,
  respectively
* Better descriptions of skills (from J), separate description for each
  rating
* Added the one thing that always bothered me: spaces after each newline
  when processing monster descriptions, thanks to J
* Added two new quests made up by DarkGod and available in the elvish
  town of Angwil
* The SAMESPD flag is removed, the code calculating energy in melee2.c
  having repeatedly crashed the compiled Linux binary. Strange indeed!

Features added in 1.0.3

* Code brought into partial conformity with ZAngband 2.2.2 (incl. the
  new quests)
* Scrolls of Enchant Item now work on those rings which have a pval
* Scrolls of *Remove Curse* can sometimes reverse the curse on an item
  (a Ring of Damage [-9] becomes a [+9]). The chance increases with
  your level, and the item must be cursed (trying to reverse an uncursed
  bad ring will not work)
* Returned to the old code for handling destroying of inventory items. Only
  weapons and armor need and will use the hitpoints now
* Potion of Extra Attacks! Now guess what's this for :-) It always works
  the first time, but may fail later...
* The Stone of Lore no longer gives pernament light
* The Weaponmaster will now give you the average damage a weapon does
* Clarified a bit what the "niceness" of a god means
* Stupid me! I've added the naming routine to a portion of the code which
  was #ifed out at compile time, so no wonder it didn't work! Now corpses
  are named properly
  No unnatural corpses will be generated (no legs of snakes, arms of
  potion mimics and so on)
  Eating corpses confers on you effects taken both from monster attacks
  and their flags. It can give you timed resistances, drain experience,
  restore mana, induce unpleasant things, and many others. I added a few
  new flags in RF9_ for this purpose
  Corpses are now a nice present for your deity (separate body parts may
  be valued less). This partially solves the dilemma of sacrificing your
  best finds to please your godly patron
  You can choke on food, so don't be a glutton (this has to be tuned out,
  high constitution would probably help avoid death from choking) - it
  induces vomitting and confusion anyway, even if you make a saving throw
* Flavored attacks (ie. colorful and sometimes plain silly messages
  when you hit a monster) - switched off by default
* A guild for Chaos Warriors - you can buy (draw, actually) mutations or
  have all of them removed for a hefty price. You can also make a chaotic
  weapon from any weapon that is not an ego-item already. Like with other
  guilds, those services are also available for outsiders, but for a
  considerably higher price
* Eol, Maeglin and Ar-Pharazon added in lieu of suspicious non-Tolkienian
  uniques (all are taken from O, Maeglin is downgraded and appears at a
  higher depth)
* I forgot to make Morgoth drop his goodies again... now corrected. Also
  removed the useless artifact drops from Amberites, and added Eol dropping
  one of his famous two swords (Arunruth or Anguirel)
* Weapon damage depends on player's strength and monster's AC. In extreme
  cases it can take ten times as much damage as normally possible! Warriors
  reduce the damage loss based on their level (not a fixed divider of 2)
* Super heal spells for Morgoth and Sauron
* A new 'precognition' power for mindcrafters (at level 30). Lets you
  know what OoD monsters and objects are on a level, without need for
  cheating. The working time is limited, so it's best to cast when changing
  levels. Note: the old 'precognition' power (detecting monsters and all),
  has been renamed to Awareness
* Undead start out at night

Features added in 0.5 (finished 25.12.98)

* First of all, fixed the dreaded "turning High Mage" bug, which, as
  it turned out, appeared when using staves
* Some features from ZAngband 2.2.2d added (including slower regeneration
  and less vampiric draining for badly mutated characters)
* Started working on the new magic system, in which fire, air and earth
  based magic replaces chaos, sorcery and nature, respectively. Water
  is left in lieu of trump (unfortunately). Arcane magic is also
  rethought. Life and death remain unchanged
  See the ../lib/help/magic.hlp file for details
* Priests and paladins get a random minor god to start with, and some
  starting grace (influenced by WIS)
* Restored items of *Slay* /Foo/ to their vanilla glory
* Roguelike command for sacrificing/god info (^O)
* Fixed a bug with negative price for branding weapons in CW guild
* Fixed running through and near to trees
* Fixed removal of mutations (some messages were out of place)
* Scrolls of Nothing can no longer be sold in shops
* Fixed a stupid bug with some options not being saved
* Barbarians (and only they) also get hasted when using the Berserk
  innate ability. Spells and random berserking do not confer this
* No sensing while berserk (by spell, mutation or racial ability)
* Recharge service in towns works once per day - this is now explained
* Fixed problems with some bad mushrooms being sell-able
* Regularized the attacks hounds have (always 1 or 2 bite attacks and
  2 claw attacks)
* Smart monsters will not get scared while the player is confused
* Timed blindness and confusion resistance, combined as an effect in
  the Potion of Clear Mind (as requested by Chris Weisiger)
* Gods will only reward you for converting altars if you're pious enough.
  Unsuccesful bashing is rather bad for your alignment, to prevent bashing
  abuse
* Gaze and touch of death applied to some monsters (stay away from those
  beholders, now...) Undead races and golems are immune
* Timed ego properties of a weapon; all branding spells now use this.
  Branding code is fixed to preserve to_h/to_d bonuses, if greater than
  zero. The whole thing is a huge hack; the timeout value is used (basing
  on the fact that a weapon should not be both artifact and ego). Damaged
  items cannot be branded (or else it would be a repair spell too)
  Branding in guilds will give you pernament brands, though
  *IMPORTANT POINT* - you cannot sell weapons thus enchanted in shops,
  to prevent making fast money!
* Stoning attacks (only in melee) - you will get stoned in 5 turns (or
  as much as there are given as monster "damage", but setting this
  over 5 is not particularly sensible)
* "Stoning bolts" as one of the Earth spells (doesn't work on uniques
  and some (mostly nonliving) monsters). Other monsters may still
  resist, and *you* may get hit with the reflected bolt. You have
  been warned
* The game reacts to phases of the moon, like NetHack. On a full moon,
  your luck will always be positive; on a new moon, always negative.
  On Friday 13th your luck might be very, very bad...
* Mixing potions as one of the Water realm spells. The downside is that
  (a) there are not very many combinations presently, (b) order matters
  (mixing A with B is not the same as mixing B with A), (c) this can
  be abusable to a certain extent (if you're patient enough)
* Flooding area as one of the Water realm spells. Monsters which cannot
  swim will start to take damage by drowning (uniques can't die by
  drowning, though, but nearly all are able to swim)
  This is an experimental feature, and quite buggy to boot. Monsters are
  not very smart and will happily continue on drowning if they're "chasing"
  you through a wall
  There is a problem with monsters which don't move. Although some are
  able to blink away, most (eg. mimics) will die on the spot. But you
  can always kill a mimic with a missile/spell attack, so drowning it is
  all too similar
* "Transfer Life" is a spell that allows you to empower your weapon with
  some of the effects monster attacks and properties have, via their
  corpses. In the True version, brands are pernament. Note that if a
  monster has, say, only one elemental attack of four, the chance of
  getting it as a brand is 1/4
* Corrected the graf-new.prf file, to display proper monster tiles (not
  all monsters have tiles, as for now - this is rather annoying at moments)
* You cannot target non-hostile monsters
* A lot more monsters (including some baby/young dragons) have the
  HURT_FIRE or HURT_COLD flag
* When resting, your character will try to repair his wielded weapon. How
  fast s/he can do it depends on their DEX
* Warriors can buy a random slay/kill brand in their guild

Features added in 0.6 and 0.6b (finished 15.1.1999)

* Added most of the things present in ZAngband 2.2.3 (note: the
  'vanilla town' option can be requested with the -t command line parameter.
  DON'T restart a game without this switch if you started one with it,
  or vice versa (and I mean it! Make a batch file/script. You have been
  warned)
* Pet commands are assigned to the P key (^P in roguelike keyset)
* Support for X11 tiles (the 8x8 ones) has been taken from Angband 2.8.3,
  but is rather broken at present.
* Automatic Roman numbering of your characters. When you die, a counter
  of successive generations is incremented and the next character you roll
  has it added to their name as a Roman numeral (for example Foo XXIII).
  Some people find it a method to distinguish the 'descendants' of a
  character
  This feature is #defined in config.h, and is not compiled in by default
* Friendly uniques now have their own set of sayings in friendly.txt.
  Most of those were contributed by D.Stage (dstage@u.washington.edu)
  and Ethan Sicotte (slit@maine.com)
* Variable letters and colors to represent the player, depending on
  race/class (instead of the default white @)
* Fixed an unwanted interference of timed ego items and their activations,
  resulting in loss of ego after recharging time has elapsed
* Arcane branding spell now makes timed weapons of Slaying rather than
  Trump ones
* Fixed Petty Dwarves' histories
* Fixed Eol, Maeglin and their swords once more, to be more in accord
  with actual Tolkienian narrative
* Fixed a stupid bug which caused finishing of "find artifact" quests
  by wielding or picking a normal weapon
* Horns, beak, tentacles and the like mutations decidedly ruin your
  charisma level
* Beastmen and Vampires got their stat bonuses (DEX and INT) improved,
  at the expense of worse luck
* Fixed the Create Water spell, which produced a crash
* Creating small floods with weird attacks now gets a proper description
* ?=/(|$# monsters no longer cry out in pain
* No zero scores in the high score table
* Detecting traps detects traps on chests
* Detecting doors detects locked doors
* Reworked some GOOD/EVIL flags on monsters (there are good dragons too now)
* Three more types of dragons in dragon pits (bronze, gold, pseudo)
* Dunedain are more prone to get the "resist serious damage" mutation
* New Dunedain classes (ie. those not in vanilla) now have proper tiles
  assigned
* Pernament ESP and temporary ESP combined let you see dumb monsters
* Fixed a few water spells, disabling ability to flood deep lava, stairs
  and quest features
* The O command always displays the god info. W is used for 'W'orshipping
  (sacrificing). In roguelike keyset they're resp. ^O and ^G

Features added in 0.6c (finished 29.01.1999)

* Changed the way gods are handled. Right now, you only have grace, which
  increases with offerings and decreases with time (albeit very slowly)
  and prayers. Different levels of grace will yield certain effects on
  you; when you are pious enough, you have to find an altar and get
  crowned, and get a nice (or not) artifact.
  Deities were reduced to six in number, and so were altars. Altars are more
  rare - roughly one in five levels, but sometimes there can be two on
  a level.
* Priests and paladins are likely to damage WIS (not CON) when over-exerting
  from lack of mana
* Vault type is printed when cheat_room is on
* Some new vaults (mostly the large ones) designed by Chris Weisiger
* Scythes of Slicing are vorpal
* Added the whisper/yell patch by Jon D. Boehnker (jboenhker@aol.com)

Features added in 1.0beta (finished 21.02.99)

* The player has an alignment! The good/neutral/evil nature of our @ is
  directly linked to the god they worship (when changing gods they change
  alignment), like in NetHack. Alignment + good charisma may cause some of
  the weaker monsters (but no more than 50%) of your alignment to be created
  friendly (does not apply to uniques, questors and summoned monsters)
* Some races start with a specific alignment, some without any (marked '-')
* Extensive changes to monsters' flags (also see below): coins and Q's
  no longer animals, yeeks good, drastically reduced the number of evil
  animal monsters
* Star signs have some interesting influence on the character
* Fixed a bug with *identification* of charging artifacts
* Fixed floating numbers being rounded at the beastmaster's
* CTRL-V will print features (compilation options) the game was compiled with.
  Mainly for me checking the ARCN state
* Fixed automatic weapon repair to adjust it to player's DEX. Now you need
  to have DEX of at least 13 to be able to repair anything, and even then you
  have only 1/10 chance each turn to improve it by small amount (warriors
  repair at double rate). The amount repaired with each try increases
  exponentially as DEX rises higher. Having DEX of 18/200 or more makes all
  repair checks succeed
* Removed the S-Lang scripts support - no longer developed by RR
* Reworked the final scoring routine. Now includes penalties (percentage
  modifiers) for having mutations, except for beastmen and CW
* You are no longer notified about monsters using phase door/teleport when
  blind
* New "metric" option allowing the game to display things in kilograms and
  centimeters instead of pounds and inches
* Smart monsters don't pick up cursed objects, and no monster will pick
  up the corpses of its kin
* Fire/plasma breaths can turn floor and most features into shallow/deep
  lava, respectively. Cold/ice breaths can freeze lava into floor again
* Added monsters' vulnerability to electricity, acid and poison (poison for
  quylthulgs, acid for plants and some mechanical monsters, elec for
  some water monsters)
* RES_STON can be used to mark monsters resistant to stoning (other than
  mimics/undead/constructs). Mainly needed to protect the cockatrices...
* Vaults have min/max level constraints (most are without any, though).
  Max level of 0 translates to max level of 127
* Corrected a fatal bug with Create Water spell once again
* 'War Branding' spell now does actually inflate/deflate damage dice of
  a weapon
* Fixed a bug with number of items on floor when blind
* Added skill numerical ratings beside descriptions, for easy orientation.
* Added some "likely mutations", if the player is of evil alignment. Discover
  for yourself :)
* Lowered exp penalties for H-Giants (30%) and H-Titans (100%)
* Fixed breaking random artifacts. Some (rarer) items now have the NOBREAK
  flag, which means they'll never get damaged in melee.
* Rings of Sustaining/Resistance fixed weight, random high resistance for
  the latter
* New, better rules for damaging weapons: 1) each total loss of HP results
  in to_hit, to_dam, and damage dice/sides (sometimes) being reduced, 2)
  after that the whole 'breaking' process starts again, 3) using a scroll
  of repair will restore lost dice and change minuses to 0, if not
  cursed, 4) the items are not marked as damaged in any way, they're
  just slightly deteriorated (the message you get reflects this).
* Fixed bug with ARCN and newly created savefiles
* Yipee! At last! Away with the ugly numbers in r_info and the neccesity
  of updating all your quests when renumbering monsters! Now you can (and
  indeed must :) give the full name of the monster in quest data. The name
  must EXACTLY match the one in r_info.txt (case is irrelevant), or else
  nothing appears
* Added some monsters and nice items courtesy of Paasi Huttunen
* Bull Gates can no longer appear in the dungeon or outside, thus solving
  problems with the M$ quest

Features added in 1.0 (finished 1.03.1999)

* Completely reworked wilderness, now size 16x19. A new town, Zul, added
  in the mountains of the north (courtesy of Brent ''RaBiD'' Diana)
* No random quests for unfair monsters if the option is off at startup
  (if it isn't, and you switch it off later getting sick of S-T Distortions,
  strange things might happen if such a quest was rolled. You have been
  warned)
* Invisibility implemented. It burns LOTS of food, so be careful not to
  starve. Invisibility spell added to Air realm. Transparency effects
  implemented, similar to ADOM's.
* Use of Artifact Creations scrolls can be cancelled without losing the
  scroll
* Greatly reduced Water spells costs/fails for mage types
* Changed vanilla_town option to be asked at startup
* Inventory slot (quiver) for ammo
* Monsters can hit traps (quite unbalanced and buggy for now). Smart monsters
  can disarm traps. Flying monsters are unaffected (not compiled in by
  default)
* Reworked critical hits; made maximum probability dependant on class as
  well as on weapon weight/level. More types of critical hits, with
  *EARTH SHATTERING* giving as many as 10 times the base damage. This gives
  warriors which use heavy weapons an extra edge against tough monsters
* Lowered the percentage of mountains in hilly terrain - the game hung
  sometimes, being unable to find a place for monsters
* Final score computation method totally reworked. See the FAQ
* Tombstone will now mention death from paralyzation
* You can only sign up for quest when your level is half the quest danger
  level. IOW you must reach level 2 to do the first quest (Thieves' Den)
* Tired of making up new player names over and over? Want to save your
  high score list from monotony? The game can give your character a random
  male or female name if you do not provide it yourself. Over 800 male
  and 400 female names (see {m|f}_rnames.txt in lib/info). Feel free to
  expand this

Features added in 1.0b (Finished ?)

* Mostly minor bugfixes: prevent spawning infinite arrows, fix trouble
  recalling from wilderness, tweak a few monsters, lower cost and value
  of items giving bonuses to speed, rework Wands of Striking/Storms
  (appear earlier), fix metric weights in shops, fix druid quest again

Known bugs:

* Items which
 weigh 0.1 lb do not show up properly when metric measurements
  are on (the last digit is surpressed, leaving 0.0(5))
* Luck has to be improved. Luck sustain item flag added but not used (hobbits
  have their luck sustained intrinsically, though)
* Blasting you by your god sometimes crashes the game (the blasting is
  very rare, and usually provoked by the player, though)
* When stoned, you have some turns to attempt to recover, but stoned
  monsters die instantly
* If you're playing a class with two elemental realms and use a spell
  which conjures a spirit/elemental, only one of your classes will
  be used (in the order air, fire, earth, water). Eg. if you have
  Air and Water spells and summon an elemental from the Water book,
  an air elemental will appear.
  Fixing this will require a lot of summoning code rewriting (*or*
  this could be subject to the star signs that are planned for the
  next version)
