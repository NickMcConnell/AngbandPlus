Known bugs:
	Pluralization bugs everywhere. staff->staves is proper.
	When posessors are forced out of corpse, but are wearing cursed
		item, nothing happens. Fix will be implemented once we
		have DG's golem code (after this release), at which
		point the body will be mangled into a blob with all the
		old corpse's equipment slots

        Monster memory does not fully work for ego monsters
