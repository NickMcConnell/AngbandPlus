               Cat-and-the-Hack Angband


Cat-and-the-Hack Angband is Copyright (c) 2000 by neko, with prior work
by the thousands who have maintained the Angband source. Distribution of
this variant is the same as that of Vanilla Angband, of course.

For information on what has changed, see the '/lib/help/variant.txt',
which is also available through the help menu.

If you would like to use any of the changes in CatH in your variant, by
all means, do so; one purpose of CatH is a sortof 'proof of concept' of
ideas that have floated through my mind. I wouldn't mind a line of
credit if you do so, however.

The current verson of CatH-Angband should be available at
http://cath-angband.sourceforge.net . If you have any suggestions,
bugs or whatever, send them to neko@inet.att.co.kr. Thank you.
