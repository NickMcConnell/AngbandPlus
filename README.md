# ToME-SX
ToME-SX (short for "Sexy Edition") is a variant of the roguelike game ToME, based on version 2.3.5. The scope of this project
is to add variety to the game, change some parts that (according to my personal opinion) need changing, and provide other people
who are interested in the variant with the possibility of playing and enjoying it too. Have fun!
