<LI>Changed the Load Window to be more interesting</LI>
<LI>Added Html-based help system using the TkHtml widget</LI>
<LI>Double-clicking a radiobutton in Birth Window goes to next screen</LI>

<LI>Deep Water, Deep Lava, and Shallow Lava and Trees are passable at all
  times, but the character may burn/drown as in ZAngband.</LI>
<LI>The "Research Monster" building command is implemented.</LI>
<LI>The "mapcolor" command now has "assign" and "names" suboptions.</LI>
<LI>The file "progress.tcl" was renamed "progress1.tcl". Apparently some
  Window systems are set up to in such a way that the DOS name of both
  progress.tcl and progress2.tcl is PROGRESS.TCL, resulting in one of
  the files being overwritten (or something).</LI>
<LI>Added a context menu to the Store Window, allowing the user to buy and
  sell items, and to exit the store. The normal inventory context menu
  is also available in the Store Window when choosing an item.</LI>
<LI>Added "ishome" option to the "store" command to see if the current store
  is the Home.</LI>

<li>Clicking the Message Window will toggle the inventory/spell
display. This is in addition to the previous behaviour of displaying the
previous message or bypassing the -more- prompt.</li>
<li>Added menu help strings to the most of the windows.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where any trailing 'r' was stripped from the trigger of a
macro when displayed in the "Trigger" label. This was already fixed for
triggers displayed in the list of macros.</li>
<li>The auto-roller screen in the Birth Window now displays the total
roll needed to create a character with the stats entered by the user. This
figure can be used to decide whether the auto-roller can possibly roll the
given combination of stats.</li>
<li>Added the Find command to the Help Window (which was removed when the
TkHTML widget was added). I had to add "search" and "see" commands to TkHTML
in order for this to work.</li>
<li>Made various cosmetic changes to make building under MS VC++ smoother.</li>
<li>Merged together all the tk, tk/src and tk/library sources for all the
*AngbandTk games.</li>
<li>Added a groovy About Window with a scrolling list of credits.</li>
<li>The icon .icd and .msk files are now compressed using zlib.dll.</li>
<li>Added "ascii isascii" command to see if an icon type has a font.</li>
<li>Assigning icons to features now updates the icon map, so changes will
take effect when the screen is redrawn.</li>
<li>Added divine 32x32 graphics by David E. Gervais!</li>
<li>Added three new quests by David E. Gervais!</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where wielding a quest item would result in the quest
being marked completed, even if the quest was completed or rewarded
already.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with easy_disarm not ignoring already-disarmed chests.</li>
<li>Use a "safe save" procedure when writing out the tk/config/assign file.</li>
<li>Fixed an old Angband bug with the description of disarmed chests
(pval < 0).</li>
<li>As in ZAngband, any unique quest monsters that were already killed are
revived. This should probably only apply to uniques that are required to
complete the quest, but the quest description might mention the unique.</li>
<li>Artifacts on quest levels are always created, even if they were already.
It would be better if the object allocation functions would ignore items
needed by any quests. Ditto for uniques.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a Weapon of Force kills a monster but the character
has more attacks on the monster.</li>
<li>The Assign Window now displays in the statusbar which feature, monster
or object the icon the pointer is over is assigned to. When the pointer is
over an icon type the icon type is displayed.</li>
