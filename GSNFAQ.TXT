Q: So what is that GSNband game I keep hearing about?

A: GSNband is my own attempt to enhance ZAngband, a well-known Angband clone
   by Topi Ylinen and Robert Ruehlmann, with a number of features and
   breakthrough additions (like the ARCN, see below). As it were, I also
   went from a state of C illiteracy to a decent command of that language
   (but not the details of each operating system I happen to work on) while
   working on the game.

Q: What is the legal status of GSNband?

A: GSNband is free software; it can be distributed according to the rules
   laid long ago by Robert A. Koeneke for his (U)Moria game. See version.txt
   in the ../lib/help directory for details (free distribution for non-
   commercial purposes providing the copyright notices are retained
   throughout the game)
   
   If you plan to put GSNband on a cover CD-ROM or similar wide-range
   medium, please inform me in advance. You DO NOT have to ask me for
   permission, but it's polite anyway. Same rules apply if you write a
   review of GSNband and put it in written press or on a Web page.

Q: Can I modify GSNband?

A: Yes, but if you make any significant changes, please distribute this
   as your own variant (with the provisions regarding copyright applying
   as above). You MAY distribute changed info files, quest definitions,
   and anything that is easily editable without need for the source code;
   please note, however, where the files come from.
   
Q: Why is GSNband so slow?

A: GSNband is a complex and complicated game; the sources take well over 4 MB
   of code. Game speed is comparable to ZAngband's, since the inside engine
   is virtually the same. On Intel platforms, you'd probably need at least
   8 MB to play at decent speed; lower values might work for you, but there's
   no guarantee. The CPU should be a 486 or better; 386 is supported, but
   probably works awfully slow.
   
   I don't know the specific memory/CPU requirements to run the game on
   other platforms; could somebody help me determine this?

   If you notice that the game is greatly slowed by wilderness generation,
   you can use the vanilla-like town option at startup. It also has
   an impact on your final score.
   
Q: Why are there no tiles? They used to be there in previous releases.

A: The reason is that I added a lot of monsters which do not have tiles.
   This makes gameplay weird, especially if you have a mixed group of
   tiled and non-tiled monsters.
   
   Another reason is that I'm not a big fan of the tiles - as they stand
   now. The 8x8 tiles are not even worth considering. The 16x16 tiles
   by Adam Bolt are somewhat better, and actually playable if you strain
   your sight a lot, but the colours are too sombre and some monsters
   do not differ quite well.
   
Q: Shouldn't GSNband take place in Beleriand?

A: Yes, it should (if you dispense with the inconsistent storyline and
   cast of characters). The problem is that the maximum boundaries for
   the wilderness are not known with any certainity, nor is their
   impact on memory requirements. 20x20 wilderness is probably the
   safest we can get; anything larger would drastically increase memory
   consumption, meaning less people can play the game.

Q: Ok, so what's that world there in the game?

A: A fictional one. It has no name (neither has ZAngband's; it does not
   pretend to be Amber). The idea is to have 2-3 bigger towns with
   quests and several small villages scattered around which do not have
   all the buildings (you start in one, for example)

   Of course if you don't like the wilderness you can play the old
   vanilla-like town (sadly, it is non-random)

Q: What's the ARCN? Why isn't it in the binary game?

A: Automatic Roman Character Numeration, or ARCN, is a system which
   keeps track of the descendants your original named character has
   spawned (as shown by the number of subsequent deaths), and appends
   a Roman numeral each time a new character of that name is created.
   Changing the name resets the counter.
   
   The ARCN isn't part of the binary releases of GSNband, because I
   don't want people to get annoyed at the game putting weird stuff
   in the characters' names for them. If you want to use ARCN, you
   probably know how to compile the game anyway; #define ARCN in
   config.h to include it in the game.

Q: How is the score calculated?

A: Basic score is calculated as experience + level_score * max_lvl, where 
   level_score is the average level feeling you got, and max_lvl is
   the deepest level reached.
   
   Then the basic score is multiplied by a percentage factor which is 
   calculated as follows:
   
   * For each mutation, -10% (exception beastmen and CW)
   * If using maximize mode, -10%
   * If using preserve mode, -15%
   * If using vanilla town, +30%
   * If using hard quests, +30%
   * If allowing small levels, +20% (if always generating small levels,
     add 50% instead)
   * If allowing arena levels, +10%
   * If allowing unfair monsters, +50%
   * If autoscumming, -50%
   * If monsters are behaving stupidly, -50%
   * Monster AI options are worth 20% each

   If sum of the above would fall below 10%, 10% is used instead.
   
   (the highest score multiplier you can get is therefore 220%; it will
    give the inital score of about 110 for someone who has just entered
    the dungeon. Hm.)
    
   Finally, the cost of all identified and non-storebought items the
   character is carrying, divided by 10, is added. Items possessed at
   the start of the game are considered storebought.

* (for Polish readers) Czy jest jakas dokumentacja po polsku?

  Nie ma. Wychodze z zalozenia ze kazdy kto chce sie bawic w roguelike
  zna angielski na tzw. poziomie. Tlumaczenie dokumentacji i listy zmian
  za kazdym razem gdy cos jest dodawane strasznie wydluzyloby czas pracy
  nad gra.
