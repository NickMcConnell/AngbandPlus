     Sangband is a complex, single-player dungeon adventure game in which you,
the player, control a character in a world of magic and cold steel.  During the
course of your adventures, you may learn long-forgotten secrets, collect
wondrous objects, and defeat terrible foes.  Perhaps, if you are very skilled,
you may even defeat the Dread Enemy himself:  Morgoth, Lord of Darkness.
     But only if you are very skilled indeed.

     Sangband is a variant of Angband, which is a variant of Moria, which is a
descendant of Rogue.  Its primary inspiration is the works of J. R. R. Tolkien,
among the greatest wordsmiths of the English language.  You will also notice
some Dungeons and Dragons conventions, ancient and religious mythology, and the
fables and lore of the European Middle Ages.

===================== Game Tutorial:  The Novice's Guide ======================


     When you begin the game, you start out in a town with stores happy to sell
you whatever they stock and you can afford.  Visit the stores and stop by your
very own home (the symbol '8'), where you can safely stash all sorts of useful
gear for later use.

     Look at the left side of the screen, where all the most important info
about you is displayed.  Reading from the top, you'll see your name, present
title, unspent experience, and money on hand.  Your race (almost) never changes,
but you can gain more experience points by killing monsters and more gold by
selling the loot they drop.
     Below these are the six vital statistics:  Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.  Near the bottom, you will see your
armour class, hit points, and (when you learn magic) your spell points.  Armour
class shields you from direct damage.  Hitpoints are your life wrapped up in a
number, so run from anything that drops them too low, too fast.

     Get familiar with some of the commands you have available to you, either by
reading the help, or by experimenting, whichever you prefer.  If you mistype,
the game will offer to bring up a list of commands.
     To exit this tutorial, hit escape.  When ready to continue, type '?' to
open up help, then press '1' twice.



     Okay, time to get playing!  Pick up an inexpensive weapon (store 3), some
flasks of oil (store 1) or a sling and some shots (store 3), some light armor
(stores 1 and 2), and some phase door scrolls and potions of cure light wounds
(Stores 4 or 5).  If one is available, get your hands on a lantern, because the
extra light it provides is very handy.  Once you've earned a little money,
invest in a shovel or a pickaxe.  Now, 'w'ear a torch or your lantern, your
armor, and your weapon.
     See that down staircase '>'?  It's the entrance to the deadly, lucrative
dungeon.  Head down (Once on top of the staircase, type '>').
     Once you do that, you will find yourself in a dungeon of rooms and
corridors.  Since you have already wielded a light source, you can see, even if
you are not in a magically lit room.  Go off and explore the dungeon.  When your
light runs out, re'F'uel it.  When you get hungry, 'E'at some of the food your
character started out with.
     When you meet your first monster, pepper it with sling shots (press 'f' to
fire) until it reaches you, and hit it with your weapon (move into it) until
it's dead.  If your HPs drop too low, quaff a potion of cure light wounds, read
a scroll of phase door, or run away.
     When you get enough money and objects to sell, go back up to the town.
When you get a little experience to spend, type '$' and put it to good use.  If
you have questions, the '?' key is there to help.

Have fun!



============================ Overview of the Game =============================


     This section briefly describes starting up a new game and the most
important game displays.  To learn more about these things, consult the sections
on your character and on interfaces.


====== The title screen ======

     When you start up the game, a title screen appears, bearing the game logo,
a dragon image, and some credits.  Also on this screen are the three most
important Sangband resources:
     The Sangband home page at "http://home.sprintmail.com/~leon2m/sang/"
contains the current source and executables, special files, helpful comments,
hints, and links, and the latest Sangband news.
     Sangband changes maintainers every so often.  The current one is Leon
Marrick.  If you want to send him comments, or make sure your bug report gets
heard, email "leon2m@sprintmail.com".
     The Angband newsgroup is at "news:rec.games.roguelike.angband"; it's filled
with helpful folks.  If you want to talk about Sangband or ask for help, this
discussion forum is the place to go.


====== The birth interface ======

     The game then shows the file-management menu if it didn't find a savefile
list.  This menu allows you to start new characters and manually load old
savefiles.  Normally you will want to do the former.  On some systems, such as
Macintosh and Windows, you can also use the menu commands.

     Creating a character is easy.  You choose a gender, a race, and roll for
vital statistics and money.
     Once you have does this, you are presented with another display showing
more information about your character.  You also see this display every time you
load an existing savefile, and whenever you press 'C'.  At this point you can
reroll for better statistics and more money, press Return when satisfied, and
name your character.


====== The main screen ======

     Once you clear the character display, you find yourself looking at the main
screen.  This display is divided into four parts:

1)   The message line is located at the top of the screen; here all sorts of
messages are shown.  If in the heat of combat you skip past one too many, you
can display it again by pressing control-P.
2)   The left side of the screen is used to display important information.
3)   Most of the screen displays your surroundings.  You can take a closer look
by pressing 'l'ook (or e'x'amine).
4)   The bottom line of the main screen shows various status displays, such as
your speed, ailments, depth, and so on.


====== The character screen  ('C') ======

     The character information display you see when first starting the game can
be recalled by typing 'C'.  Here you can review your attributes, change names,
and save character dumps to file (which appear in the "lib/user" directory).


====== The skills screen  ('$') ======

     When you collect enough experience, you can spend it on skills by typing
'$' to open up the skills advancement screen.


====== The help screen  ('?') ======

     The online help system is available by typing '?'.  You can also learn more
about the symbols you see on screen by typing '/', then the symbol you wish to
learn more about.


====== The options screen  ('=') ======

     You can adjust the way the game looks and behaves by typing '=' to enter
the options screen.


====== The knowledge screen  ('~') ======

     Detailed listings of known artifacts, objects, and monsters are available
through the knowledge menu, which you access by typing '~'.  Here you can also
review the high score listings, what you have stashed in your home, and see how
many monsters you've killed and what quests you are assigned.


====== The death interface ======

     If you should die, you will see a tombstone and be able to check out your
slain character one last time.  Here you can:
- display the character screen and see your possessions,
- review the final messages,
- save information in a character dump,
- see the high score table, and
- fully identify individual items.




=============================== Your Character ================================


====== Races ======

     There are eleven different races that you may choose among, representing
most of the speaking peoples found in Tolkien's books, plus Gnomes and Half-
Giants.  Races differ in abilities, and tend to be better at some skills than at
others.

Human:
     Most widespread of all the races, humans can live just about everywhere and
do just about anything.  They have no special adjustments to stats, no special
strengths or weaknesses, and learn all skills at an average rate.  This gives
them the greatest flexibility of all races; this, combined with their solid
hitpoints, makes them effective adventurers.  Humans get small bonuses with
crossbows and have no infravision.  They probably get the best prices in stores,
on average.

Elf:
     Known as the Elder Race, Elves are famed for their knowledge and
craftsmanship.  They are somewhat lighter, weaker, and less robust than humans,
but have superior wisdom and intelligence, learn magic more easily, and are
somewhat better at most basic skills.  They are fond of bows, somewhat weak in
melee, and have no infravision.  They resist light inherently.

Hobbit:
     Hobbits are shy, retiring folk with enough good sense to share.  They are
the smallest of all the races.  Although they have few hitpoints, they are
highly resistant to magic and can sometimes endure ailments that would lay other
races low.  They are fairly poor at melee combat, but good at most other skills.
In particular, nobody can match a hobbit slinger or burglar.  Hobbits are
stealthy, perceptive, and have innate infravision.  They sustain dexterity
inherently.

Gnome:
     Gnomes are the pudgy pranksters of the dungeon; if they can kill something
in a humorous way, so much the better.  They may be small and ugly, but can
outbargain and outwit just about anyone.  They are among the frailer races, and
not powerful in combat, but are good at magic, unmatchable with devices, and
immune to paralyzation.  Gnomes are highly intelligent and have innate
infravision.

Dwarf:
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  They are strong,
wise, tough, and resistant to magic; although not very good at casting spells,
they make excellent priests and smiths.  They are better than average at melee
combat, but don't know the first thing about bows.  Dwarves have good innate
infravision and can never be blinded.  They do have one big drawback, though:
Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with
themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In
other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.

Half-Orc:
     The bastard offspring of humans and orcs, half-orcs are ugly, strong, and
have very bad attitudes.  Their magic is a little suspect, as are most of their
skills, but they know how to fight and can take as much damage as they dish out.
Half-orcs have innate infravision and resist darkness inherently.

Half-Troll:
     Half-trolls are built like blocks of granite; no other race can match their
strength or recover hitpoints as quickly.  Their combat prowess is fearsome,
they throw boulders with deadly force, and their stomach capacity is impressive.
Unfortunately, they have poor skills, need to eat a lot, and have a hard time in
stores.  Half-trolls will be bad at anything that requires heavy thinking.  They
have innate infravision and always have their strength sustained.

Dunadan   (easier to win with -- 20% penalty to score):
     Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder race surpasses
the abilities of other humans in every field and has superior vital statistics.
Despite these great advantages, they learn just as quickly as other humans do,
which makes them a great choice for players whose other characters die too
quickly.  Dunedain always have their constitution sustained.

High-Elf   (easier to win with -- 20% penalty to score):
    High-elves are undying beings dating from the beginning of the world.  They
are masters of all skills, and are agile and intelligent, although their wisdom
is sometimes suspect.  No other race is quite as good at magic.  Despite these
great advantages, they learn just as quickly as other elves do, which makes them
a great choice for players whose other characters die too quickly.  High-elves
begin their lives able to see the unseen, and have innate resistance to light.

Dark-elf:
     Some elves prefer the darkness to the light, caverns to forests, sorcery
and necromancy to the magic of nature.  Dark-elves are extremely intelligent,
make very good magicians, and can even hold their own in melee, but are not
nearly as good with missile weapons as are other elves.  Some of their other
skills are also weak.  They do, however, learn forging quickly and well.  Dark-
elves always have their intelligence sustained.

Giant:
     Eight feet tall, nine, even ten feet tall they stand, and broad in
proportion.  Giants have more hitpoints than any other race and make formidable
wrestlers.  Their high strength and constitution make them decent fighters,
especially with clubs and thrown objects, and they can readily learn magic or
object-creation.  Unfortunately, all those tales about the naivete and
clumsiness of giants have a large grain of truth to them.  No other race is less
perceptive than giants, and none is more easy to spot.


Racial adjustments to stats:

 Human          0     0     0     0     0     0     10        0

 Dunadan       +1    +1    +3    +2    +3    +2     10        0
 High-Elf      +1    +3    -1    +3    +1    +3     10        0

 Giant         +3     0    -2    -2    +2    -1     13        0

     All racial stat adjustments act as modifiers to your maximum internal
stats.  A Half-Troll, for example, can raise his internal strength to 18/140,
but his dexterity only to 18/70.

     Higher values mean that the skill is more expensive to raise.  All races
can (eventually) attain maximum level in any skill.



====== Character Attributes ======


Score:
     Sangband uses a scoring system.  You get points by defeating unique (named)
opponents, and lose them for buying more skills.  However, once you earn a
score, it can never go down; you will never be penalized for buying skills after
you defeat an opponent.
     Because there are relatively few limits on skill advancement, you can
become very strong indeed before you fight opponents.  However, those who buy
fewer and less expensive skills to build their character get better scores.

Approximate equation:
     (250 * monster_depth * monster_depth),
     divided by
     (level of each skill, times the base cost of that skill, all summed
      together)
+50% for defeating Sauron or
+100% for defeating Morgoth

                "The best score yet reported is 4614."


Experience:
     As you kill monsters, learn about objects by using or eating them, cast
spells and pray prayers for the first time, disarm traps, and unlock doors
(listed in descending order of importance), you gain experience.  Once earned,
experience can be spent on skills.

Power:
     Your power depends on the level and base cost of your skills.  The primary
effect of this is to increase hit points, but it also has other effects.  The
maximum power level is 100.

Gold:
     Gold is amazingly handy, because everything stores sell can be yours with
enough of the stuff.  Characters start out with an amount of gold determined by
stats (lower is better, except charisma, where higher is better).  Social class
greatly influences starting gold (higher is better).
     Inside the dungeon lies more gold than you will ever find, more seams of
treasure than you will ever dig, and more monsters carrying loot than you will
ever kill.

Hitpoints:
     Your hitpoints are your life wrapped up in a number; if they ever drop
below zero, you die.  Resting will restore hitpoints, but you should always have
some quicker way to heal yourself on hand.  Your maximum hitpoints depends on
your overall power, race, and constitution.  It also varies according to skill:
Those who have taken the Oath of Iron have the highest number of hitpoints,
Oath-bound magic-users have the lowest, and all other characters fall somewhere
in between.

Spellpoints:
     If you use magic, you will also have spellpoints, or mana.  Your maximum
mana depends on your magic power skill and your intelligence (if you are using
sorcery and necromancy) or wisdom (if you are using natural or holy magics).
Ways to recover mana faster than by resting are rare and greatly desired.
     Mana goes down if you wear heavy armour, or are in any shape other than
your normal one.  Sorcerers and Necromancers also lose a chunk of mana if they
wear most (but not all) kinds of gloves.

Armor Class:
     Armor class makes you harder to hit in melee, and reduces the damage you
take from almost all monster blows.  You may raise it by equipping more and
better armor, by increasing your Dexterity, and by activating various temporary
effects.  As time passes, you will find this value rising past 100, even to 150
and above at very high levels.

Fame and Titles:
     As word of your accomplishments spreads, you earn new titles.  Titles
describe what skills you're especially good at.
     You can also gain fame, especially by fulfilling quests.  The higher your
fame, the better the rewards you get from the Inn.

Luck:
     On rare occasions you can become unlucky.  Unlucky characters meet nastier
monsters and less interesting treasure.  Although there is no way to magically
restore lost luck, it slowly recovers as you continue to explore the dungeon.
     If you want to keep careful track of your luck, you can go into options ->
screen layout -> left panel, and activate the "luck" display.


--- Vital Statistics ---

     You have six primary statistics, or stats.  Each of them has important
effects, and how you juggle equipment to boost some stats at the expense of
others can greatly help or hinder your adventuring.  Deep in the dungeon,
potions exist that can permanently raise your stats.
     The lowest any stat can go is 3, a level that greatly reduces any abilities
that stat influences.  The lowest "safe" figure for most stats is 7, but you
can't expect any significant bonuses until the stat reaches 18 or higher.  Once
you get a stat that high, further increases will greatly enhance your abilities,
eventually making it possible to slay some truly formidable monsters.  Stats max
out at 18/220.
     Stats depend on your internal stats (which range from 3 to 18/100), the
equipment you are wearing, your shapechange, and various temporary conditions.
Learning any magic realm increases its spell stat by 2.  If you also take the
Oath associated with that realm, this bonus increases to 4.  Taking the Oath of
Iron increases the combat stats, and good wrestlers and users of Karate get
bonuses to strength and dexterity.


Strength:
     Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee and with missile
weapons.  Increases in Strength increase damage, allow you to get more blows
with heavier weapons, and boost the effectiveness of shield bashes.  Strength
also improves your tunneling ability, allows you to bear more weight without
being slowed down, and wield heavier melee and missile weapons effectively.

Intelligence:
     Intelligent characters use magic devices, pick locks, and disarm traps more
effectively.
     If you are using sorcery or necromancy, intelligence is your primary stat.
It controls how many spells you may learn, the amount of mana you have, and your
spell failure rate.  If you are using holy or natural magics, wisdom controls
all of these things.

Wisdom:
     Wise characters have a better chance of resisting magical spells cast upon
them by monsters.  Wisdom is a priest or druid's primary stat.

Dexterity:
     Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high dexterity may
allow you to get multiple blows with lighter weapons, and will significantly
increase your chances of hitting with any weapon and dodging blows from enemies.
Dexterity is also useful in picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting
yourself from some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeon.  It affects your
rate of recovery from stuns.

Constitution:
     Constitution determines your ability to resist physical damage and disease,
and your rate of recovery from from poison, disease, and cuts.  It makes a great
difference to the amount of hitpoints you have and the speed at which you
recover them, and so is a vital stat for any character.

Charisma:
     Charisma represents a character's ability to influence others.  A character
with a high charisma will receive better prices from store owners, whereas a
character with a very low charisma will be robbed blind.


--- Abilities ---

     In addition to your stats, certain basic abilities define your character.
They depend on race, stats, and skill level.  You can most effectively keep
track of your abilities by using the Character screen.

Melee Ability:
     The higher your melee ability, the more frequently you will hit in hand-to-
hand combat and the more critical hits you will get.  Your race, dexterity,
melee weapon or barehanded skill, plusses to Skill on equipped items, and
temporary effects are all factored into the skill value displayed on your
character screen.  This also holds true for missile and throwing ability.

Shooting Ability:
     The higher your shooting ability, the more frequently you will hit with
missile weapons and the more critical hits you will get.

Throwing Ability:
     All sorts of things, from flasks of oil, to boulders, to potions and
mushrooms, can be thrown effectively.  The higher your throwing ability, the
more frequently you will hit with thrown objects, and the more damage and
critical hits you will get with special throwing weapons.

Saving Throw:
     The higher your saving throw, the more likely you are to resist the side
effects of monster blows and spells, traps, your own magic (when it fails), and
mental attacks.  Saving throw depends on race, wisdom, and your magic resistance
skill.

Stealth:
     The ability to move silently about is very useful.  If your stealth is good
enough, you can avoid fights, get in the first blow, and fight monsters one at a
time.  Stealth depends on race and your stealth skill.

Disarming:
     The higher your disarming ability, the more quickly and safely you can pick
locks and disarm chests and traps.  Dexterity and Intelligence both affect this
ability, as does the disarming skill.

Magical Devices:
     Determines how likely you are to succeed in using staffs, wands, rods, or
any activatable item.  Race and intelligence both affect this ability, as does
your magical device skill.  You need a lot of skill to handle high-level wands,
staffs, and rods, and also a fair amount for certain rings, amulets, and special
wearable items.

Perception:
     The higher your perception, the more likely it is that you will see traps
and secret doors automatically or by searching for them.  Perception depends on
race and your perception skill.
     Note that this ability has no direct relationship to your ability to sense
objects or hear monsters.

Infra-vision:
     The higher your infravision, the further away you can see warm-blooded
creatures, even when invisible or not lit.



====== The character screen (in detail) ======

     The character information display allows you to review your attributes,
change names, and save character dumps to file (which appear in the "lib/user"
directory).  The save character to file command saves several bits of
information including the main character screen, character background, inventory
and equipment, skill levels, and the contents of the home.

     This interface has four modes, which you may cycle through by typing 'h'.


--- Main character screen ---

- Name, title, gender, and race
- Age, height, weight, and either social class (affects starting gold) or your
greatest victory.
- Your base (undrained) vital statistics (stats) and sometimes their drained
values
- Maximum and current hitpoints

- The number of blows you get in hand-to-hand combat, also known as melee
(always starts out as two; may eventually rise or fall)
- Plus to melee Skill (affects how often and how well you hit monsters when
attacking hand-to-hand)
- Percentage bonus to Deadliness:  The melee damage you do is adjusted by this
percentage.
(If you are not wielding a melee weapon, you see a guess at the average damage
you've done recently in karate or wrestling).

- Your character power (affects hitpoints and many other things)
- Score (how well you are doing in the game.  Always starts at zero.)
- Unspent experience (the experience you've earned that you haven't yet spent on
advancing skills)
- Gold
- Maximum depth you've ventured down in the dungeon.

- Maximum and current mana (you need to learn magic to increase these)
- The number of shots you get per turn.  Starts out at zero, increases to 1 if
you wield any missile weapon, and may rise further.
- Plus to missile Skill (affects how often and how well you hit monsters when
shooting)
- Percentage bonus to Deadliness:  The missile damage you do is adjusted by this
percentage.

- Your overall melee Skill.
- Your overall shooting Skill.
- Your overall throwing Skill.
- Your ability to dig through rock
- Your saving throw (protects you from all sorts of nasty magic)
- Your stealth (how naturally quiet you are)
- Your ability to find traps and hidden doors
- Your ability to disarm traps and unlock doors
- Your ability to use magical devices (wands, staffs, rods, etc.)
- How good you are at automatically dodging melee blows and some missiles
- How famous you are
- How far you can see warm-blooded creatures, even when invisible or in darkness

     The descriptions of your basic abilities improve as the abilities
themselves do, but may decrease as you rise in power.  A given disarming skill
is much more impressive at dungeon level 10 than at level 60.


--- History display ---

     This is like the main display, except that the list of abilities is
replaced with a character history.


--- Attributes screen ---

     Lists most of the non-combat attributes that equipment may posses.  Shows
only known or obvious properties.

Vital Statistics:
     In the top-center of this display are listed the internal values (the
permanent ones you have before any modifications) for your stats, any
adjustments through equipment items, any through character race, skills, and
conditions, the adjusted stats, and their drained values (if different).
     Modifiers to stats are light green if the object does not also sustain that
stat and green if it does.  If the object sustains a stat without affecting it,
a green 's' is displayed.

Numeric Modifiers:
     The top-right and top-left of this screen shows other numeric modifiers.

====== Skills ======

     You can normally raise as many skills as you have the experience to afford.
The major exception is that you need to choose between becoming a pure
spellcaster, a spellcaster/fighter, or a pure fighter.  Any of these, however,
can become great at burglary, magical devices, or object-creation.


--- The Price of Skills --

Striking a balance:
     You should strike a balance between focusing on too few skills (the cost to
raise skills goes up rapidly with level) and too many (which fritters away your
hard-earned exp).  Raising too many skills that depend on objects (most kinds of
combat or forging, say) can also cause real problems with managing your
inventory; you just don't have enough space for everything.
     As mentioned before, the fewer times you raise skills to defeat a given
opponent, the higher your score.

Minimum experience:
     The minimum experience required to raise skills goes up with character
power, but the experience you get from killing monsters increases very rapidly
as you descend into the dungeon.

Practice:
     The price to raise certain skills goes up if you haven't used that skill
much.  For example, if you've never used edged weapons, and suddenly raise your
Swordsmanship skill 20 points, you can expect to pay considerably over the odds.
This is an excellent reason not to raise a skill too far, too fast.  This only
applies to skills that directly earn you experience:  any of the combat skills,
burglary, disarming, magic, and magical devices.
     You practice skills whenever you gain experience, and whenever you do
physical damage to a monster.
     When a skill is more difficult to raise because of lack of practice, the
skills screen will display its cost first in grey, then in yellow, orange, and
red.


--- Oaths ---

     The most powerful warrior arts and the most awesome magics require intense
commitment.  This commitment is represented by Oaths.  Taking an Oath is
binding; you can never retract it.  You can never take more than one Oath.

The Oath of Iron:
     The Oath of Iron is the greatest of commitments; none who refuse to take it
can learn the most powerful warrior arts.  Inductees can spread their blows out
among weaker monsters, can handle heavy weapons with ease, have better combat
stats, get the most bonuses to missile might and shooting speed, the most
hitpoints, and have access to several very powerful talents.  However, they can
learn no realm of magic, and cannot raise their magical device skill past 50.
     You gain access to the Oath of Iron by raising a combat skill to level 45
or above.

The Magic-users' Oaths:
     Each realm of magic also has an Oath.  Wizards may take the Oath of
Sorcery, Priests subscribe to the Covenant of Faith, Druids join Yavanna's
Fellowship, and Necromancers bind themselves to the Black Mystery.  Spellcasters
that have taken the Oath associated with their realm cast spells at full power,
have another +2 bonus to their spell stat, and eventually get plenty of mana.
However, they also are worse for their skill in all kinds of non-magical combat,
have a hard time with heavy armour, and get fewer hitpoints.  Spellcasters that
haven't taken any special Oath have only a few of these limitations, but cannot
raise their magic power skill past 50 (so they're limited to half the mana), and
cast spells at 80% strength.
     You gain access to the magic-user Oaths by choosing that realm of magic,
and then navigating to the specialist skill for that realm (wizardry, holy
alliance, etc.).


--- List of Skills ---

Swordsmanship   (cost - 13):
     Determines hit chance and critical hits with swords and other bladed
weapons.  Allows characters to wield heavier weapons without penalty, and handle
two weapons at once more effectively.
     Bladed weapons are relatively light and easy to use.  Many a hero of old
has chosen them; their battle-blades still exist.  However, most swords do not
have the raw power that the greater hafted weapons and polearms possess.
     Swordsmanship also advances other skills:  Jousting rises 1/2 as quickly,
Clubbing rises 1/4 as quickly.

Clubbing   (cost - 12):
     Determines hit chance and critical hits with blunt weapons.  Allows
characters to wield heavier weapons without penalty, and handle two weapons at
once more effectively.
     Hafted weapons tend to be heavy, sometimes very heavy, but potentially do
more raw damage than either swords or polearms.  They are also effective against
monsters that resist edged weapons.  Critical hits with blunt weapons
occasionally stun monsters.
     Clubbing also advances other skills:  Swordsmanship rises 1/4 as quickly,
Jousting rises 1/4 as quickly.

Jousting   (cost - 12):
     Determines hit chance and critical hits with pole-mounted weapons (spears,
axes, halberds, quarterstaves, etc.).  Allows characters to wield heavier
weapons without penalty, and handle two weapons at once more effectively.
Increases any armour bonus that polearms provide (bonus can be up to five times
normal).
     The more powerful polearms often require two hands to use, a real
disadvantage.  However, many polearms grant significant bonuses to armour class,
and critical hits with polearms directly rob monsters of energy.
     Jousting also advances other skills:  Swordsmanship rises 1/2 as quickly,
Clubbing rises 1/4 as quickly.

Archery - Xbows   (cost - 9):
Archery - Bows   (cost - 9):
Archery - Slings   (cost - 5):
     Determines hit chance, critical hits, and power and number of shots with
crossbows, bows, and slings.  Crossbows get higher missile multipliers, bows get
extra shots, and slings get both.  Characters that have taken the Oath of Iron
get the most bonuses and specialist spellcasters get the fewest.
     Crossbow and bow skills improve each other (1/2 as quickly).

Throwing   (cost - 8):
     Determine hit chance with any thrown object.  With special throwing
weapons, determines chance of critical hits and damage multiplier.  This skill
can make carrying around flasks of oil or ordinary daggers quite handy, and
allow you to turn potions you wouldn't want to drink and well-balanced weapons
into deadly missiles.

Wrestling   (cost - 10):
     Affects hit chance and damage when wrestling.  Sufficient increases in this
skill increase strength and also dexterity, allow you to bash doors and chests
with greater force, tunnel more rapidly, and recover from stuns more quickly.
Good wrestlers get an HP bonus of up to 50.
     Wrestling requires that you not wield a weapon (You can carry a shield,
however).  This combat method doesn't work on non-material beings, and will hurt
you if you try it on highly poisonous or acidic creatures, elementals, or
vortexes, but is fully effective against monsters that resist edged and/or blunt
weapons.  Wrestling does a lot of damage and sometimes allows you to rob
monsters of energy by throwing them to the ground.  You need to be quite strong
to be a truly effective wrestler.
     If you are a good enough wrestler, and have taken the Oath of Iron, you can
turn your skin to stone (65) or go into a berserk fury (80) at will.

Karate   (cost - 10):
     Affects hit chance and damage when using karate.  Sufficient increases in
this skill increase dexterity and also strength, allow you to dodge better and
become slightly more stealthy, and recover from stuns more quickly.
     Karate requires that you not wield a weapon (You can carry a shield,
however).  This combat method doesn't work on non-material beings, and will hurt
you if you try it on highly poisonous or acidic creatures, elementals, or
vortexes, but is fully effective against monsters that resist edged and/or blunt
weapons.  Karate does a fair amount of damage and often inflicts momentary
stunning, confusing, or slowing.  You need to be quite dexterous (and also
strong) to be a truly effective user of karate.
     If you are good enough at karate, and have taken the Oath of Iron, you can
sometimes go into a brief trance-like state (90) in which you are highly
resistant to damage.

Spellcasting   (cost - 16):
     Determines the level of spells that can be cast and the raw power of most
spells.

Magical power   (cost - 12):
     Determines the maximum amount of mana you have to spend on magic spells.
Specialist spellcasters can raise this skill to the maximum, spellcasters that
have not taken an Oath cannot raise it above level 50, and non-spellcasters
cannot raise this skill at all.

Wizardry   (cost - 7):
     Determines spell failure chance and reliability for wizards.  Allows you to
learn about base monster mana faster, and even be able to make good guesses
about current mana (especially for well-known monsters).  Protects against mana
draining attacks.
     A relatively high wizardry (and also perception) skill is essential for
reliably finding essences, especially deep in the dungeon.  You cannot search
for essences at all unless you have a Wizardry skill of 15 or higher.
     If you are not a wizard, learning wizardry grants access to a few of the
spells that wizards use as talents:  detect magic (40), semi-controlled
teleportation (50), and mana recovery (75).

Holy Alliance   (cost - 7):
     Determines prayer failure chance and reliability for priests.  Yields
warnings of demonic creatures, up to and including real-time detection.
Provides a substantial degree of protection from their blows, increases critical
hit chance*.  Eventually increases intrinsic light range (this is the only way
to get a light radius of five).  Reduces the damage you take from light, and
eventually renders you invulnerable to holy orbs.  Controls the duration and
effectiveness of protection from evil spells.  Improves your chance of sensing
cursed and blessed items.  You cannot learn both Holy Alliance and Blood
Dominion.
     If you are not a priest, learning holy alliance also gives you two special
talents:  sense evil (30) and restore stats (75).

* The extra critical hit chance and protection granted by Holy Alliance, Nature
Lore, and Blood Dominion is greatest for those who have taken the Oath of Iron,
middling for those without a magic realm, and relatively low for magic-users.

Nature Lore   (cost - 7):
     Determines lore failure chance and reliability for druids, and their
ability to forecast the weather.  Yields warnings of natural creatures, up to
and including full real-time detection.  Provides a substantial degree of
protection from their blows, increases critical hit chance.  Makes you learn
about any monster faster.  Improves personal protection and hit chance in
forested terrain.  Improves your ability to learn about mushrooms.
     If you are not a druid, learning nature lore also gives you two special
talents:  detect animals (25) and mend self (50).

Blood Dominion   (cost - 7):
     Determines ritual failure chance and reliability for necromancers.  Yields
warnings of undead creatures, up to and including full real-time detection.
Provides a substantial degree of protection from their blows, increases critical
hit chance.  Reduces the damage you take from darkness, and makes it much less
likely that you will get the Black Breath.  You cannot learn both Holy Alliance
and Blood Dominion.
     If you are not a necromancer, learning blood dominion also gives you two
special talents:  sense undead (25) and restore experience (85).

Magical Device   (cost - 13):
     Determines success rate with wands, staffs, rods, and activatable rings and
amulets and the power of most of their effects.  Makes recharging less likely to
blow up items.  Allows you to learn the true effects of magical devices and
activatable items more quickly and to automatically sense charges (70).

Burglary   (cost - 14):
     Allows you to steal gold, lock doors, and get highly effective sneak
attacks against sleeping monsters and backstabs against fleeing ones.  Most
importantly, you can set deadly traps for unwary monsters.  Burglars become
worse with heavy melee weapons but much better with light ones as their skills
improve.  They make considerably less noise in mon-magical combat.
     Burglary also advances other skills:  Disarming rises 2/3rds as quickly,
perception and sneaking rise 1/3rd as quickly, and dodging rises 1/4th as
quickly.
     Burglary grants three talents:  Nab object (40), poison ammo (55), and hit
and run (70).  It also grants three special abilities:  stealing (4), locking
doors (7), and trap-setting (10).
                         See the section on burglary.

Perception   (cost - 7):
     This talent improves your ability to find traps and hidden doors.  A
relatively small investment in it gives you hints on unidentified object quality
much more often (this is very useful, and a good reason to pay attention to this
skill early).  It also improves the chance to get full numerical data on the
power of magical devices and activatable items and to automatically sense
charges.  Perception biases all sort of sighting and awareness rules in your
favour; for example, it enables you to sometimes "hear" unseen monsters nearby.
Take this skill high enough, and you will start to get precognition messages
(which can be extremely helpful for a truly skilled character).  A relatively
high perception (and wizardry) skill is essential for reliably finding essences.
    Perception grants one talent:  Sense area (55).

Stealth   (cost - 6):
     Decreases the amount of innate noise and also most kinds of directed noise
you make; when deliberately "sneaking", this effect is tripled.  Increases the
power of various camouflaging and concealment magics.  Most importantly, stealth
makes it more likely that monsters will be generated asleep and reduces the rate
at which they enter the dungeon (the "word doesn't get around").
     Stealth grants two talents:  Sneaking (10) and superstealth (60).

Disarming   (cost - 4):
     Improves your ability to safely disarm traps and chests and unlock doors.
When at or above the current dungeon or chest level, this skill guarantees safe
disarming (magic, in contrast, is always slightly chancy).

Dodging   (cost - 6):
     Improves ability to retain spellpoints when wearing heavy armour.  Gives
you a guaranteed armour class even if you are wearing no armour.  Is the most
important factor in your ability to dodge missiles, both magical and physical,
and some kinds of traps.  Also gives you protection against melee attacks
(especially attempts to steal).
     However, in order to dodge missiles, traps, and melee blows effectively,
you also need to keep your Dexterity high, and your carried items (especially
your shield!) light.  Your character screen takes all of this into account.

Spell resistance   (cost - 6):
     Increases your saving throw against magical and mental attacks (blinding,
confusion, paralyzation etc.).  Attention paid to this skill can save your
life...

Weaponsmithing   (cost - 9):
     Once you raise this skill to 15, allows you to forge melee weapons from
components found in the dungeon.  Note:  you also need to be relatively skilled
in using the weapon type you are making.

Bowmaking   (cost - 10):
     Once you raise this skill to 15, allows you to forge missile weapons and
missiles from components found in the dungeon.  Note:  you also need to be
relatively skilled in using the weapon or ammunition you are making.

Armor forging   (cost - 14):
     Once you raise this skill to 15, allows you to forge armor from components
found in the dungeon.  Armor forging is very expensive, because there are almost
no object qualities that cannot be had with enough skill, good enough
components, and a dash of luck.

Alchemy   (cost - 10):
     Allows you to create potions, scrolls, rings and amulets.  You need a skill
of 10 to create potions and scrolls, and a skill of 35 to create rings and
amulets.

Magical infusion   (cost - 13):
     Infusion is among the most powerful of skills, because it allows you to use
magical essences to control the powers that armour, weapons, and missiles get,
pack essences into potions that explode violently when thrown, and make more
potions and scrolls using a given number of essences.  You need an infusion
skill of 10 to infuse forged items.
     Infusion grants one talent:  Recharging with essences (30).



====== Talents ======

     The game will notify you of any new talents you get as you raise skills.

     Typing '[' brings up a list of talents.  If you have at least one talent,
you can browse (get extra information about) it by typing '*', or mark it (get
notification when it is again available for use) by typing '!'.


--- List of Talents ---

Turn skin to stone:
     Increases your armour class substantially.  Requires a wrestling skill of
65 and the Oath of Iron.

Berserk fury:
     Drives you into a berserk fury, which greatly increases your strength,
melee skill, and hitpoints, but hinders archery and throwing, reduces your
armour class, and leaves you exhausted.  Requires a wrestling skill of 80 and
the Oath of Iron.

Resist damage:
     Lets you go into a brief trance-like state in which you take only 2/3rds
damage from all forms of attack.  Requires a karate skill of 90 and the Oath of
Iron.

Learn about monster:
     Gives you partial information about a single monster, especially about
attributes that would determine which weapon you might use against it.  Requires
the Oath of Iron.

Detect magic:
     Reveals most kinds of magical items nearby, which is very helpful for
finding concentrations of neat loot.  This talent does not reveal essences.
Requires a wizardry skill of 40.  Wizards use a spell instead.

Phase warp:
     Semi-controlled teleport.  At levels not much above the minimum, is only
slightly better than a phase door, but at high levels, gives good control of
movement.  Requires a wizardry skill of 50.  Wizards use a spell instead.

Tap magical energy:
     Allows you to regain mana by tapping magical devices (especially staffs and
wands).  This can be a very useful ability indeed, because ways to magically
recover mana are rare.  Requires a wizardry skill of 75.  Wizards use a spell
instead.

Sense evil:
     Detects evil monsters (even invisible ones) nearby.  Requires a holy
alliance skill of 30.  Priests use a prayer instead.

Restore stats:
    Instantly restores all of your vital statistics to maximum.  Requires a holy
alliance skill of 75.  Priests use a prayer instead.

Sense animals:
     Detects natural creatures (even invisible ones) nearby.  Requires a nature
lore skill of 25.  Druids use a technique instead.

Mend self:
     Reduces cuts, stuns, blindness, poison, and disease.  Requires a nature
lore skill of 50.  At very high skill levels, allows you to heal yourself
rapidly.  Druids use a technique instead.

Sense undead:
     Detects all undead monsters nearby.  Requires a blood dominion skill of 25.
Necromancers use a ritual instead).

Restore experience:
     Restores your skills.  This talent is very powerful, but you need a blood
dominion skill of 85 to use it.  Necromancers use a ritual instead.

Sense charges:
     Those skilled with magical devices often automatically sense charges on
wands and staffs.  If this automatic sensing fails, this talent guarantees
success.  Requires a magical device skill of 70.

Nab object:
     Fetches an object in line of sight to you, even if a monster is on top of
it.  The maximum weight of the object goes up with skill.  Requires a burglary
skill of 40.

Poison ammo:
     Allows you to use certain mushrooms and potions to poison ammunition; such
missiles do extra damage to all monsters not resistant to poison.  Note:  this
skill is not an easy money-maker, because all objects you create yourself are
discounted by 80%.  Requires a burglary skill of 55.

Hit and run:
     Casts a spell around you; when you next hit a monster in melee, or steal
from it, you will execute a phase door.  The neat thing is that the monster gets
no chance to retaliate.  Requires a burglary skill of 70.

Predict weather:
     Druids rely on this talent to tell them what the weather is like.  The
accuracy of weather predictions goes up with perception skill, and down as you
descend into the dungeon.  A druid needs to wait some time between forecasts,
but may get automatic reports when the weather changes (again, depending on
perception skill and dungeon depth).

Sense area:
     Magically maps the local area, revealing walls and floors (but not objects
or monsters).  Requires a perception skill of 55.  Eventually gains extended
range.

Sneaking:
     When you use this talent (or type the 'S' (or '#') key), you start to sneak
around.  This slows you down but makes you more stealthy (depends on stealth
skill).  Also, the higher your Burglary skill, the more likely that you will get
especially deadly sneak attacks (much more effective than the ordinary sleeping
monster bonus) on sleeping monsters.  Requires a stealth skill of 10.

Superstealth:
     Greatly increases your stealth temporarily.  Requires a stealth skill of
60.  At a stealth of 90 or greater, cancels aggravation temporarily.

Recharging:
     Allows you to use essences to recharge wands, staffs, and even rods.  This
method is riskier to you than normal recharging, but is much less likely to blow
up the item you are working on.  Of course, you have to find the right kind of
essences first.  Requires a magical infusion skill of 30.

Weapon forging:
     Allows you to create weapons using components.

Armour forging:
     Allows you to create armour using components.

Bowmaking & fletching:
     Allows you to create bows and ammunition using components.

Alchemy:
     Allows you to create potions, scrolls, rings, and amulets using bottles,
parchments, and essences.

Dragon-breathing:
     If you are in dragonform, you can use this talent to consume essences and
breathe them out in powerful breaths.  The amount of damage you do depends on
your total power and on the type of essence you choose (the more likely the
breath is to be resisted, the more damage it does).
     Of course, you have to find a way to turn into a dragon first...


--- Object-forging ---

     When using an object-forging talent, you usually need some kind of input.
You can only create weapons, armour, and missiles in the town.

Components:
     Components of metal come in several different types; the higher level the
component, the more powerful the weapon, armour, or missiles that can be forged
from it.  Certain components add special qualities to the items they create;
mithril is unusually light, adamantium unusually heavy, and both ignore acid and
fire.

Bottles:
     You need empty bottles to create potions.  You start saving empty bottles
as soon as you get your alchemy skill up to 10.  Bottles come in several
varieties; the higher level the bottle, the less likely potions made from it
will shatter when frozen.

Parchments:
     You need blank parchments to create scrolls.  You start saving parchments
as soon as you get your alchemy skill up to 10.  Parchments come in several
varieties; the higher level the parchment, the less likely scrolls made from it
will burn or be destroyed by acid.

Essences:
     Essences are foci of concentrated magic; they slowly gather near objects
and monsters with strong attributes of a particular type.  Every poisonous snake
on a newly created level has some chance of having attracted an essence of
poison, fire-branded weapons might have attracted essences of fire, and potions
of cure critical wounds might have attracted essences of healing.  Objects and
monsters generated while you are exploring the level cannot have attracted
essences, because they haven't stayed in one place long enough.
     Essences cannot be detected with magic; you have to find them the old-
fashioned way, by thoroughly investigating places where you think they might be.
The higher your wizardry and perception skills, the more essences you will find.
Essences are more numerous but harder to spot deep in the dungeon.  Once you
find an essence, you pick it up by moving onto it.  It automatically goes into a
special pouch slot in your equipment; you may 'I'nspect or e'x'amine this pouch
to see what essences you have.


Forging Wargear:
     Weapon, armour, and missile forging all compete for the same kind of input:
components.  The more skilled you are, and the better the component you choose,
the greater the maximum power of the object you create.  You also need some
skill in using the object you forge, or it will be less powerful.
     When forging, you choose an object type that you are aware of.  The actual
power of the forged item greatly depends on this choice.  Melee weapons and body
armour can have a lot of attributes; other kinds of armour and missile weapons
have somewhat less, and ammunition has only a few.  Also, the higher level and
more powerful the base object, the fewer extra attributes it gets.
     Forging may fail, and when it does, things go boom.  You reduce your
failure chance by choosing low-level base object types (daggers versus
executioner's swords) and high-level components.
     You can give your forged items names by inscribing them.

Infusion of forged items:
     If you have essences, you can add specific attributes to forged items.
This can be extremely powerful, but you have to be very careful:  The greater
the percentage of total power you try to specify using essences, the more likely
it is that the forging will fail, and that you will lose everything.  Infusion
skill helps a lot with this.  The essence add screen has a handy indicator of
how dangerous things are getting.  Secondly, you can never guarantee an
attribute, no matter how many essences you devote.  You will usually end up
offering between the minimum and three times that amount, and accepting about a
33-66% chance.
     Again:  forging is very, very chancy.  Magic-using smiths and alchemists
are notorious for rearranging the landscape.  If you fail, just remember that
there are lots more essences and components waiting to be found.

Alchemy - potion-making:
     Potion-creation requires essences and bottles.  You can only make potions
that you are aware of and whose essence cost you can meet.  The higher your
alchemy skill, the higher the maximum level of potions you can make.
     Alchemy can fail, and when it does, the potion you are working on explodes
violently.  You increase your success rate by choosing low-level potions, high-
level bottles, and by raising your alchemy skill.
     You can often make more than one potion using a given number of essences;
the amount depends on the value of the potion and your infusion skill.  Making
more than one potion at a time is especially risky, but increases in infusion
skill help.

Alchemy - making potions of essences:
     Potions of essences ("magical grenades") can do a lot of damage, whether
you throw them, quaff them, or use them in traps.  Damage depends on the number
of essences you pack in, on your infusion (not alchemy) skill, and on the type
of essences you use (the basic elements do the most damage, the esoteric stuff
does the least).  If you pack too many essences in, and fail to use a sturdy
enough bottle, your magical grenade might explode...

     Approximate damage:
     skill * 1.3 (up to 130) for one essence
     skill * 1.9 (up to 190) for two essences
     skill * 2.4 (up to 240) for three essences

Alchemy - scroll-creation:
     Scroll-creation is very similar to potion-creation except that you use
parchments instead of bottles.

Alchemy - The creation of rings and amulets  (requires a skill of 35):
     Making rings and amulets needs both components and essences.  The level of
object you can make depends on alchemy skill and component quality.  Failure
chance depends on the level of the item you are trying to create and on your
skill.

     Any of these symbols may be changed using preference files, accessed using
the command '%'.

     Many variants can (optionally) use small graphical icons instead of text to
display your surroundings; unfortunately, no convenient listing of them yet
exists.


====== The Town ======

     You begin your adventures in the town.  It consists of eight buildings,
each with a shop entranceway (and one also with an inn), and is well populated.
The first time you are in town it will be daytime, but the sun rises and sets as
time passes.

Townspeople:
     Most townsfolk go about their daily tasks, paying little or no attention to
you unless provoked.  However, there are slippery-fingered thieves and armed
killers that you need to avoid.  Fights will break out, though, so be prepared.
Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue, no experience is awarded
for killing the town inhabitants, though you may acquire treasure.


--- Stores ---

     You enter buildings by walking onto their entranceways, which (in text
mode) are represented by numbers from 1 to 8 or the '+' sign.
     A new display then replaces the old.  For most buildings, you see the name
and race of the store owner, the name of the store, and the maximum amount of
cash that the store owner will pay for any one item.  Below it is displayed the
inventory; if it is numerous, you may display another page by typing space.
Near the bottom of the screen is displayed a list of commonly-used commands.
- 'g' or 'p': get/purchase an item.
- 'd' or 's': drop/sell an item.
- 'I': inspect an item (reveals any known special properties, reads spellbooks)
- ESC:  leave the store.

The General Store ("1"):
     Sells foods, drinks, cloaks, robes, torches, lamps, oil, shovels, picks,
spikes, and ammunition for missile launchers.  Buys items of these types (except
robes) and some others.

The Armoury ("2"):
     Buys and sells every kind of armour except cloaks.

The Weaponsmith's Shop ("3"):
     Buys and sells melee weapons, missile launchers, and ammunition.

The Temple ("4"):
     Buys and sells blunt weapons, healing and restoration supplies, and various
other holy items.

The Alchemy shop ("5"):
     Buys and sells potions and scrolls.

The Magic User's Shop ("6"):
     Buys and sells rings, amulets, wands, rods, and staffs.

The Black Market ("7"):
     Buys and sells spellbooks.

Your Home ("8"):
     Here you may store objects that you cannot carry on your travels or will
need later.  You may check the contents of your home when in the dungeon by
using the '~' command.

The Inn ("+"):
     Offers quests for especially dangerous foes.


--- Buying and Selling ---

     Store owners have individual personalities; often their names are a
valuable hint.  Some can offer a great deal of money, but never seem to hold any
sales; others cannot pay nearly what your valuable items are worth, but often
give great deals.  The price of items that change hands depends on their base
cost, how well your and the store owner's races get along*, your Charisma, and
the innate greediness of the store owner.

     * Everyone likes his or her own race best.
     * Elves and Dwarves detest each other.
     * Nobody loves a Half-Orc or Half-Troll but another orc or troll.

     Stores never have everything in stock; as time passes, their inventory
slowly changes (but only when you are in the dungeon).  The store owner fully
identifies everything you sell him; you also become aware of objects of that
type.

Bargaining:
     Price also depends on one factor more:  your skill at bargaining.  The
shopkeeper will immediately go to his final price on low-priced items, but for
more valuable things, you need to haggle a little.  As you glance over a store's
inventory, you will notice that some prices are in grey rather than white; they
are items that you should bargain for.
     If you are selling something, a typical haggling session starts with the
shopkeeper assuring you that a good price is maybe 50-70% of what the item is
really worth.  You demand maybe twice or three times this, and the bargaining
begins.  You bring your price closer to the shopkeeper's offer, and he then does
the same for you.  The best way to change a price is to enter "-20" or "+20",
instead of retyping a new figure.  After some rounds, you and the shopkeeper
will meet somewhere in the middle.
     The key to success is to change your price neither too little (which will
insult the shopkeeper) nor too much (which is a sign of inexperience, and will
be taken advantage of).  Some shopkeepers like to haggle more, other are
impatient and demand good offers, but you have always have enough leeway to
succeed.
     If you've gotten the shopkeeper to admit his final price, your reputation
with him goes up.  Otherwise, it goes down.  The higher your reputation as a
haggler, the more items that the shopkeeper will just go straight to his final
price on (he knows he can't fool you).  It is quite possible to get a shopkeeper
to immediately offer the final price on just about everything.
     Just be careful not to antagonize the shopkeepers too much.  You have to
work at it, but you can get any shopkeeper mad enough to throw you out of the
store.  When this happens, you can't get back in for maybe three or four days.
Fortunately, shopkeepers are forgiving souls:  as time passes, they will forget
any unhappiness you've caused them.  Shopkeepers also forget an insult every
time you buy or sell anything; if you want to get back in the Temple's good
graces, buy some potions of Cure Light Wounds.  One at a time.

     There is an option to auto-haggle, but be warned:  Those who blithely
accept the shopkeeper's prices pay a markup.  The higher the value of the item,
the higher that markup; it is nothing for anything under 250 gold and up to 33
percent for really expensive things.

Stores can upgrade their inventory:
     Every time you buy something new, especially something valuable, from a
store, it has more money to spend on items it wouldn't normally carry.  As time
passes, and you continue to patronize particular stores, you will notice two
things:
firstly, the shopkeepers will start paying special attention to you, and
secondly, that they will begin to stock a few unusual items.  It takes quite a
while, but stores can significantly upgrade their inventory over time.
     Be aware that shopkeepers mark up the prices of these unusual items.  For
valuable things, this markup can be considerable.

Shopkeepers can retire and be replaced:
     Shopkeepers do retire, but only very rarely.  The new shopkeeper benefits
from all of the money you've spent at the store, and has a good (but not
perfect) idea of how good a haggler you are.
     If you completely buy out a store's inventory, the shopkeeper may offer to
retire.  He'll demand a fortune, though.


--- Getting quests ---

    You take on quests by going to the Inn, and choosing one from the list.  As
you succeed in more quests, and take on greater challenges, the rewards for
success can become great indeed.
     When you accept a quest, you have lots of time to prepare for it.  However,
once you enter the quest level, you cannot leave for any length of time without
running a risk of failing the quest.  Failure reduces your prestige, and you may
get poorer rewards from the quest-givers until you recover their respect.



====== The Dungeon ======

     All levels other than 0 (or zero feet) lie within the dungeon.  Each level
of the dungeon is fifty feet high, and is divided into large rectangular regions
(several times larger than the screen) by impenetrable walls.  Once you leave a
level, you will never again find your way back to that region of that level, but
there are an infinite number of other regions at that same depth that you can
explore later.  Monsters move about just as you do, and you may see them again.


--- Terrain ---

     The following terrain types affect movement, combat, or both.  Because they
less frequently take advantage of terrain, monsters benefit more from favorable
and suffer less from unfavorable terrain than the player does.

Rubble:
     Slows down the player and all monsters that cannot bore or pass through
rock.  Ends LOS, stops missiles, bolts, and beams, and reduces the radius of
ball spells.  Grants the player and monsters within it some protection from
melee, ranged, or magical attacks.  Rubble may dissolve to normal floor.

Water:
     Cannot be passed by players with heavy burdens, or fiery, earthbound
monsters.  All melee or ranged attacks and most spells benefit when the target
is in water, especially water-based spells.  Fire-based spells become much less
powerful, so find a lake if you battle Smaug.  Water may evaporate.

Lava:
     Can be passed by any character, but inflicts substantial fire damage (less
for players with feather fall - they're light on their feet).  All monsters
other than fiery or strong flying creatures will not cross.  Water and cold-
based spells suffer and fire-based spells become more powerful against a target
in lava.  Lava may freeze to rubble or normal floor.

Trees:
     Slows down players not familiar with druidic techniques, and all non-
natural monsters that neither fly nor pass through rock.  Ends LOS, stops
missiles, bolts, and beams, and reduces the radius of ball spells.  Grants the
player and monsters within it some protection from melee, ranged, or magical
attacks.  Trees can burn.

Permanent walls:
     You can dig through most walls but some are impenetrable.  The dungeon is
surrounded by these kinds of walls and some special rooms are made of them.

Staircases:
     Staircases allow your character to ascend or descend from one level to
another, and are represented by "<" (up) and ">" (down).  Each level has at
least one up staircase, and two down staircases, unless it is the home of Sauron
(level 99/4950') or Morgoth (level 100/5000'), whom you must kill before
staircases will appear.  Otherwise, the staircases are guaranteed, but they may
be difficult to find.  Once you leave a level, you can never return to it.  If
you found an artifact, identified it, and left it on the level, it is
permanently lost.  Watch out for spells and traps that can suddenly force you
off the level.

Secret doors:
     Many secret doors exist in the dungeon, and may lead to anything from a new
section of the dungeon level to an empty closet.  As your familiarity with the
dungeon grows, you will know where many secret doors are likely to be.  Secret
doors always look like granite until found and, for historical reasons, are
never locked.

Traps:
     Traps also await you in the dungeon.  They look like normal floor squares
until found, too often by your getting caught by one.  They start out weak and
easy to disarm, but can get truly nasty further down...
     You find secret doors and traps by using the 's'earch command.  Many
classes can also use magic and everyone can use the appropriate magical device.
Be warned: although magical disarming is convenient, it is never a sure thing.

Mining:
     There is much treasure in the walls of the dungeon, just waiting for an
industrious adventurer to come and dig it out.  Once you can afford it, and if
you can handle the weight, bring a shovel or pick along.  Your ability to tunnel
depends on strength, weapon weight, and any special digging bonus it provides.
Your success depends on these factors and the strength of the wall:  granite is
very hard, quartz is hard, magma is soft, and rubble is very soft.
     As you get richer, the treasures in the wall won't seem so appealing
anymore, but keep an item or spell of tunneling handy.  Not only do all sorts of
special vaults lie deep below the surface, some completely enclosed by solid
rock, but smart adventurers deliberately alter the dungeon to make the most
dangerous breathers and summoners manageable.

Light:
     Your character must have some source of light in order to see, unless the
area around him is magically lit.  Depending on the items he has equipped, he
may have a light radius of one (torches with low fuel), two (a lantern or well-
fueled torch), or more, up to a rarely-attained maximum of five.  Never risk
being without light.
     A torch or lantern burns fuel, and may be refilled (use the 'F'uel command)
with other torches or flasks of oil respectively.  It is rumoured that other
light sources exist which never need replenishing.
     In addition you may get access to spells which permanently light up areas
of the dungeon; these can be truly handy, because a monster you can see coming
is much less dangerous.

Food and Regeneration:
     You must eat every so often in order to avoid starvation.  The speed at
which you consume food depends on your race (trolls need to eat a lot) and the
items your wear.  Your level of nutrition may have important effects.
 bloated  :  -10 speed, digestion very rapid
 full     :  no special effects
 normal   :  no special effects, no status display
 hungry   :  no special effects, a yellow warning appears
 weak     :  regeneration of mana and hitpoints halved
 fainting :  regeneration quartered, you faint away every so often
 starving :  no regeneration, fainting, damage taken every turn until death

     Never risk being without food.

     The speed at which you regenerate is doubled when you are resting (so rest
in place instead of staying in place whenever possible), and also affected by
various object attributes and temporary conditions.

Noise:
     Characters make a certain amount of noise all the time, which decreases as
stealth improves.  It is especially low when you are resting or sneaking.  Every
time you engage in combat, cast most kinds of spells that hurt monsters, bash a
door or a chest, kill a monster, or wreck the dungeon, you make extra noise,
which dies down again over time.
     Sleeping monsters will be disturbed by noise, especially if you are nearby
and are in line of sight.

Searching and Detection:
     There are two ways to find hidden area of the dungeon, doors, traps,
objects, and monsters; manual searching and magic.  At the beginning of the
game, you find everything manually.  If you suspect the existence of secret
doors or traps, you press 's' to search the grids around you for one turn.
Later on, you get access to objects and spells that do this for you, and very
handy they are.  The one thing that no magic spell can find for you is essences.

Level Feelings:
     Spend enough time on a given level and you will get a message describing
it.  The more interesting the choice of adjectives, the more dangerous and
lucrative the level is likely to be.  At the same time, the depth indicator
located at the bottom-right corner of the main screen will change color.  Whites
and yellows indicate relatively quiet levels, but reds and violets mean danger
and rewards.
     Things that boost level feelings include:  out of depth monsters (small
effect), out of depth uniques (larger effect), out of depth objects, certain
powerful object kinds, and very special rooms.
     You will occasionally get the message "You feel there is something special
about this level.", indicating the presence of a monster pit or nest (sometimes,
only at shallow depths), a vault (more often), a player ghost (always), or an
artifact (always).

Precognition Messages:
     If your perception skill is great enough, you will start to get
"precognition" messages indicating the presence of many of the individual
monsters, objects, and special rooms that boost level feelings.  Unlike level
feelings, they appear immediately.  The higher you raise this skill, the more
specific - and accurate - these messages become.


--- The Passage of Time ---

     Both monsters and characters gain energy each turn and use it to perform
actions.  Any creature that moves at normal speed gains 10 energy per game turn;
any monster move and most character actions take 100 energy.  Some monsters move
at double speed and you can too, if you quaff a Potion of Speed.  Actions still
take the same amount of energy, but they and you gain twice the energy each
turn.  Further down, monsters lurk that move even faster, and rare items exist
that enable you to keep pace.  If you can, avoid being slower than your foes.

An abbreviated speed-to-energy table:

(very slow creatures can get as little as 1 energy per turn)
  -20 speed:  3 energy
  -15      :  4
  -10      :  5
   -5      :  6
  normal   : 10
   +5      : 15
  +10      : 20
  +15      : 25
  +20      : 30
  +25      : 35
  +30      : 38 (energy only goes up very slowly above +30 speed)

Regeneration and recovery:
     Every 10 game turns, you regenerate some hitpoints and mana (unless you are
ill or wounded), and get hurt by cuts and poison.  Temporary conditions count
down, rods recharge, and light sources use fuel.  Every 100 game turns, you
digest some food.  Every hundred thousand game turns equals one day; the town
spends half that time in darkness and the other half in light.
     Every 10 game turns, every monster on the level gets a chance to recover
from all temporary conditions.  Every 100 game turns, they regenerate hitpoints.



====== Objects ======

     The mines far below the surface are full of objects just waiting to be
picked up and used.  The treasures of long-forgotten kingdoms, dragon's hordes,
heirlooms, wizard's stashes, and the plunder from every age of the world unite
with the scattered earthly possessions of all the foolish adventurers that died
before you to offer unimaginable wealth for those bold enough to seize it.


--- Learning about objects ---

Learning about objects:
     When you begin the game, most objects are unknown to you, and an important
task is to learn more about them so that you can use them reliably.  The
standard way to learn about an object is to identify it, but scrolls of Identify
and Staffs of Perception don't come cheap.  They also don't work on everything;
mushrooms cannot be identified with magic.

Full identification:
     Some items have special powers.  Ego-item descriptions usually tell you
everything, but artifacts are known only by legend.  A number of items (usually
artifacts and ego-items) may have random powers.  To learn absolutely everything
about an object, read a scroll of *identify* on it.  Such scrolls are rare and
expensive; if you don't have access to one, try using the object a lot and
inscribing it.
     Fully identified objects have light blue indexes, identified objects have
white, and unknown objects grey.

Scanning wargear automatically (Pseudo-ID):
     The first time you walk over a weapon, missile, or piece of armour, you
examine it for anything unusual.  Your ability to learn about wargear depends on
your perception skill, modified by any bonuses to awareness granted by equipped
items.
     When you wear or wield such an item, you examine it again, this time more
closely and with a greater chance of success.  Given a decent perception skill,
you have a pretty good shot at learning something.  Be careful though:  Objects
may be cursed and need special magic to remove!

Scanned objects are marked with the following inscriptions
   Item description               low perception          high perception
   average item:                  "unknown"               "average"
   item with plusses              "good"                  "good"
   ego-item (weapon of flame)     "good"                  "excellent"
   artifact (unique item)         "good"                  "special"
   cursed artifact                "cursed"                "terrible"
   cursed ego-item                "cursed"                "worthless"
   cursed ordinary object         "cursed"                "cursed"
   failed to learn anything       "unknown", no message appears

     Once you equip the weapon or armour, and it is actually better (or worse)
then the inscription claims, you will eventually learn more about it as you use
it in battle.  An ego-item that was originally marked "unknown" will first be
revealed as "good", then as "excellent".
     Characters who have taken the Oath of Iron are especially good at scanning
wargear, and (if their perception skill is fairly high) will be able to
instantly identify any weapon or armour they equip.

Sensing other wearable objects:
     You can often learn about rings and amulets by putting them on, and, if
that doesn't work, by wearing them for a while.  This also gives you experience.
However, rings and amulets are often cursed...

Learning about magical devices:
     You can learn the name of magical devices that you successfully use; when
you do, you get experience.
     If your perception and/or magical device skills are good enough, you can
learn about the charges on wands and staffs, especially low-level ones.  Bonuses
to awareness also work here.
     Use most magical devices often enough, especially if your perception and
magical device skills are high, and you will eventually learn more about the
damage they do or the power they have.  You may check this information by using
the 'I'nspect command.

Learning about potions and scrolls:
     There are three ways to learn about potions and scrolls:  You can sell
them, identify them, or learn about them by using them.  Learning by using is
risky but highly rewarding.  Not only do you get a lot of experience this way,
but many scrolls and potions are more powerful when you read or quaff them
unaware and unsensed.  If you quaff unaware every potion that attacks stats, and
every one that improves them, your total stat gain will improve by about 3.

Learning about mushrooms:
     You must eat mushrooms in order to learn about them.  There are some very
useful 'shrooms out there, but also some truly nasty ones...


--- Object information ---

     'I'nspecting a specific object will pop up a special display that tells you
useful things about the object kind, legends and lore, and specific object
attributes.
     Known attributes of equipped items are displayed in the character screen
display (type 'C' to bring up the character screen, then press 'h' to cycle
through the information).  This interface is helpful when you want to optimize
your equipment.
     All object types that you are aware of are listed in the knowledge menu
('~'), option 5: "known objects".


--- Inventory, equipment, quiver ---

Your inventory (backpack) and equipment (your person):
     You pick up objects by moving on top on them (if you have the "auto_pickup"
option on), or by using the 'g'et command.  You may carry up to 23 different
items or piles of items, and have 12 areas of your body where wearable equipment
may go.  Press 'i', and you see the contents of your backpack; press 'e' and you
see what you are wearing.  Both listings toggle open and closed when you press
the space key.  Items on the floor display in similar fashion.
     When choosing items, you switch between inventory and equipment by pressing
'/', and switch between the floor and either of these two by pressing '-'.
     Carry too much weight, and you will begin to slow down, making it easier
for monsters to kill you.  The point at which your load thus hinders you depends
on your strength.

Your quiver:
     Your equipment includes a quiver, which may hold up to ten different kinds
of ammo.  Once placed in the quiver (using the wield command), ammo normally
sorts in the quiver slots just as it does in the backpack.  You may lock ammo
into a specific slot, and make shooting a lot more convenient, by inscribing it
with inscriptions similar to "@1", or "@f1".  Wherever you store it, ammo still
takes up space; for every 99 missiles (or fraction thereof) that you place in
the quiver slots, you lose an inventory slot.  Any such lost slots will be
clearly marked.  Ammo on the floor will automatically combine with similar items
in the quiver, which makes cleaning up after a big fight much easier.


--- Object types ---

Wands:
     Known wands stack, combining their charges.  Such a stack may be heavier,
but can be recharged more safely and effectively.

Staffs:
     Staffs never stack unless in stores (they take up plenty of space in your
backpack).  If stacked, the number of charges that they display is prefixed by a
quantity indicator (e.g. "(2x 13 charges)", which shows that each of two staffs
have 13 charges.  Staffs may be bulky, but they have lots of charges, recharge
well, and are highly durable.

Rods:
     Rods always stack.  A stack of rods with at least one charging member will
show an appropriate inscription.  When zapped, a rod is "timed out" for a given
number of turns.  Unlike wands and staffs, rods recharge automatically.  Each
recharging rod in a stack contributes to the total recharge rate; if three out
of five rods are charging, the stack's total timeout period will decrease by
three per normal player turn.

Chests:
     Chests are difficult and dangerous to open, as they usually contain both
traps and locks.  If you succeed, you may be rewarded handsomely.  If your
disarming skill is so poor that the chest refuses to open, you can bash it into
submission.  Of course, bashing does break things...

Scroll of Word of Recall:
     The Scroll of Word of Recall deserves special mention.  Read in the
dungeon, it brings you back to the town.  Read in the town, it takes you as deep
in the dungeon as you have ever gone.  This spell takes a little time to take
effect, so don't expect it to save you in a crisis.  Should you mistakenly read
a Scroll of Word of Recall, you may cancel it by reading another.

Ego-Weapons and Armours:
     Some rare weapons and armours have special abilities.  These are called ego
items, and are feared by great and meek.

Dragon Scale Mails:
     These extremely rare pieces of armour come in many different colors, each
protecting you against the relevant dragons.  They also occasionally allow you
to breathe as dragons do!

Artifacts:
     There are rumors of incredibly rare, unique artifacts which are even more
powerful than ego items.  Some artifacts are standard, and you may already know
of their fame, while others will certainly be unfamiliar to you and will need to
be fully identified (*identified*).
     Artifacts cannot be destroyed, although they can be disenchanted.  Once you
find an artifact, and either sell it or identify and leave it behind, you lose
it forever.
     A small number of artifacts, known as Set Items, are designed to be used in
conjunction with related items.  Equipping an entire set of these items will
grant the wearer additional bonuses and abilities.  Item sets generally  consist
of two items, but may include more.  You may 'I'nspect an identified artifact to
see whether it belongs to a set.


--- Object enhancement ---

     Weapons and armour have values for Skill, Deadliness, and AC; it can be
very useful indeed to increase these values by reading scrolls of Enchant Weapon
and Enchant Armour.
- The higher the plusses are above the object's normal values, the harder it
  is to raise them further.
- The larger the pile of objects you try to enchant, the more likely it is that
  you will fail.  However, ammunition and throwing weapons are unusually easy
  to enchant.
- You can sometimes break curses on objects and even turn them into ego-items
  by enchanting them.


--- Object destruction ---

     Objects may be damaged or destroyed in your backpack and (sometimes) even
damaged while you are wearing them.
     Acid destroys armour, weapons, missile launchers, and ammunition, scrolls,
parchments, staffs, and chests.  It may slightly damage equipped weapons and
armour that do not ignore acid.
     Electricity destroys rings, amulets, wands, and (on rare occasion) rods.
     Fire destroys torches, arrows, missile launchers, hafted weapons and
polearms, gloves, boots, cloaks, shields, soft body armour, spellbooks, scrolls,
parchments, staffs, and chests.
     Frost destroys potions and empty bottles.
     Equipped items with plusses can be disenchanted.  Magical devices can be
destroyed by failed recharges.


--- Cursed Objects ---

     Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laid upon them by
joyful evil sorcerers who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.  These
horrible objects will look like any other item, but will detract from your
character's stats or abilities if worn.  They will also be impossible to remove
until a remove curse is performed.  In fact, some are so badly cursed that even
this will not work, and more potent methods are needed.
     If you wear or wield a cursed item, you will immediately feel deathly cold,
and the item will be marked "cursed".
     Shopkeepers will refuse to buy any item which is known to be cursed.



====== Monsters ======


Monsters are worth experience:
     Defeat a monster, and you will gain experience.  The amount you gain
depends on the base monster value (which goes up rapidly deeper in the dungeon).
It is divided by your own total skill:  a number that depends on your total
experience (spent plus unspent exp), and which ranges from 1 to 100.  Note that
raising skills has no effect whatsoever on your total experience.

Your Monster Memory:
     When you see a monster for the first time, all you know are its physical
attributes and whatever information the monster description may provide.  As you
fight and kill monsters, use various attacks on them, probe them with magic, and
get killed by them, you learn more about their strengths and weaknesses.
     You recall this memory in one of two ways:  'l'ooking at/e'x'amining the
monster and then pressing 'r' for recall, or by pressing '/' and typing the
monster's letter.
     Unlike object memory, monster memory can be passed on even after your
character dies.  You just need to make sure that the old savefile is in the
lib/save directory when you start up a new character.

The Monster Health Bar:
     A good way to keep track of a specific monster is to target it.  When you
do so, its health bar appears on the left side of the main screen, just below
the hitpoint and mana indicators.
     The health bar uses several colors to tell you more about the monster.
Frightened - violet, Confused - brown, Stunned - light blue, Sleeping - dark
blue, Otherwise - dark and light green when healthy, and yellow, orange, and red
when wounded.
     The health bar is bracketed in green when you have direct line of fire to
the monster, in white when you have indirect line of fire, and grey when you
have no line of fire at all.


Player Ghosts:
     Player ghosts vary from game to game depending on the name, sex, race, and
class of the adventurer or legendary Hero whose bones file was used during ghost
creation.  Should your character die, information about him will often be added
to a new bones file, inside the folder /lib/bones, and a future game might bring
him back from the dead...
     Should a ghost be slain, he may vanish forever, or he may return later in a
new, more powerful form!

====== Basic Command Information ======

Canceling a Command:
     Virtually all commands can be canceled at any point before execution by
hitting the ESC key.

Selecting an Object:
     You may select objects in your backpack (your inventory), on your person
(your equipment), or on the floor underneath you.  If you issue a command that
uses or manipulates any item, you may hit the spacebar or type "*" to display or
hide a list of all the objects that command can accept.  If the command can
accept objects both on your person and in your backpack, you can hit '/' to
cycle between the two.  If an object that the command can accept is lying on the
floor underneath your feet, you can type "_" to use that item.  You then select
the exact item by typing its index letter; if you want to play it safe, and get
an "are you sure" message, type the letter in uppercase.
     Spellcasting works very similarly.  You type 'm' or 'p', select a book, and
select a spell within that book.  You can even use books on the floor.

Command Counts:
     Any command that can be repeated, or that can manipulate more than one
object, can take a count.  By default, most that do are automatically given a
count of 99.  Although most commands that usually need a quantity will ask for
one, for other commands a quantity is only sometimes desired.  Hence command
counts.  For example, to tunnel into a wall exactly 50 times, you would type a
zero ("0"), then "50", followed by a return.  Then use the tunnel command.  All
commands that use quantities will stop if you are disturbed, accomplish your
intended task, hit any key, or when the count expires.

Targeting:
     The target command ("*") makes it possible to set up a location or fix a
monster as the point which you want future missiles and spells to aim for.  Some
other commands also allow use of the targeting interface (normally by typing
'*').  However you begin targeting, you have a number of options available to
you.
  ESCAPE and "q" :  Exit targeting mode.  Cancel target.
  "p"    :  Return to the player.
  "o"    :  Start looking at all grids (exact control).
  "m"    :  Start looking only at monsters (if any monsters are around).
  "+"    :  Look at next monster or interesting grid.
  "-"    :  Look at previous monster or interesting grid.
  "r"    :  (If cursor is on a monster) recall monster information.
  "t"    :  Target grid or monster.
  space  : see monster's carried objects (if looking)
  return : continue looking

     If you have the "use old target by default" option on, be careful about
clearing targets on the floor when done.

Targeting -- line of fire:
     Line of fire (LOF) is reflexive:  if you can hit it with bolts or missiles,
it can hit you -- and vice-versa.  However, you (and your foes) have wider
fields of view, and can see many things that can't be hit.  The monster health
bar serves as a handy indicator:  When a monster is not in LOF, its health bar
is bracketed in grey.  If it is in LOF, it will be bracketed in green if you can
fire upon it directly with arrows or bolts, and white otherwise.
     If using targeting mode to aim a missile, you are not allowed to select a
monster not in direct line of fire (although you can target its grid by typing
'o', then 't').

Doing More with Less Effort:
     In the help file "macro.txt" is a section on making macros to:
- quickly switch to a shovel or backup weapon,
- fire a missile or cast commonly used spells with a single keystroke,
- prevent accidental use of valuable equipment,
- and many other things



====== Command Descriptions ======

     Command names are followed by one or two characters:  the first is that
used in the original keyset; the second, that used in the roguelike keyset.


Inventory list (i) :
     Displays a list of objects in your backpack.

Equipment list (e) :
     Displays a list of objects you are currently wielding, wearing, are
carrying in your quiver, or otherwise have immediately to hand.

Drop an item (d) :
     Drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the floor.  If the grid
you are standing on has 20 objects already, or contains terrain that cannot hold
objects, the object will wind up nearby.  This command takes half a turn.

Destroy an item (k) / (Ctrl-D) :
     Destroys an object in your inventory or on the dungeon floor.  If the
"verify destroy" option is active, you must verify this command.  This command
takes a full turn.

Wear/Wield equipment (w) :
     Wears or wields an object in your inventory or from the floor.  Since only
one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield an item into a
slot which is already occupied, the old item will first be taken off.  If there
is no room in your inventory, it drops to the floor.  This command takes a full
turn.
     Wearable objects prefer certain slots, and each item usually takes up one
slot.  There are exceptions, however:  Depending on item type and weight, you
can wield one weapon and a shield, one weapon in both hands (with your shield
ending up on your back), or a weapon in either hand.  More details about all
this are available in the non-magical combat section.

Take off equipment (t) or Take off equipment (T) :
     Use this command to take off a (uncursed) piece of equipment and return it
to your inventory.  If there is no room in your inventory for the item, your
pack will overflow and you will drop the item after taking it off.  This command
takes half a turn.

Switch primary and secondary weapon (X) :
     Actually a keymap, this command exchanges whatever weapon you have wielded
with the first weapon in your inventory inscribed {@0} or {@w0}.  This is very
handy for swapping in and out shovels.  This command takes a full turn.


--- Movement Commands ---

Stay still -- with normal pickup (,) / (.) :
     Stay in the same square for one move.  If you normally pick up objects you
encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on.  You may also use the
"5" key (both keysets).  This command takes a full turn.

Walk -- with normal pickup (;) :
     This command activates every time you press a direction key; it moves you
one step in the given direction.  This command takes a full turn.
     If the auto-pickup option is on, you will try to pick up objects
automatically.  If the option to prompt before picking things up is off, you
will grab everything you encounter until your backpack is full.  If this option
is on (recommended after the first few levels of the dungeon), you will be asked
about objects.

Walk -- flip pickup (-) :
     Walk.  If you normally pick things up, don't.  Otherwise, do.  This command
takes a full turn.

Run (.) / (,) :
     This command is very useful for rapid dungeon exploration.  It will move
you in the given direction, following any bends in the corridor, until you
either have to make a choice between two directions or are disturbed.  Most
players run by holding down Shift and pressing a direction key.

Go up staircase (<) :
     Ascends an up staircase you are standing on.  Going up a staircase will
take you to a new dungeon level unless you are at 50 feet (level 1), in which
case you will return to the town.  This command takes a full turn.

Go down staircase (>) :
     Descends a down staircase you are standing on.  Going down a staircase will
take you to a new dungeon level.  This command takes a full turn.


--- Special Action Commands ---

Get objects (g) :
     Pick up objects and gold on the floor beneath you.  Picking up gold takes
no time, and objects take 1/10th of a normal turn each (maximum time cost is a
full turn).  You may pick up objects until the floor is empty or your backpack
is full.

Rest (R) :
     You recover from wounds twice as fast by resting than by repeatedly staying
still.  This command can be told to stop automatically after a certain amount of
time, or when various conditions are met.  In either case, you always wake up
when anything disturbing happens, or when you press any key.
     After typing 'R', use "*" to rest until your hitpoints and mana are
restored, and "&" to rest until you are fully "healed".  This command may accept
a command count (used for the number of turns to rest), and takes a full turn.

Easy rest (x)   (not available in the roguelike keyset) :
     Actually a macro, this command automatically makes you rest until your HPs
and mana are restored or you are disturbed.  It is included to cut down on wrist
stress and allow more effective waiting.

Search (s) :
     Search for hidden traps, secret doors, and essences in nearby spaces.  More
than a single turn of searching will be required in most cases.  This command
can take a count, which is useful if you are confident of finding something
eventually, since the command stops as soon as anything is found.  This command
takes a full turn.

Toggle sneaking mode (S) / (#) :
     If you have a stealth skill of at least 10, allows you to start and stop
sneaking.  See the talent "sneaking" for more details.


--- Dungeon and Object Alteration Commands ---

Tunnel (T) / (Ctrl-T) :
     This command allows you to dig through barriers, mine treasure found in
wall seams, and otherwise alter the dungeon to your liking.  This command may
take a count and requires a full turn.

Open a door or chest (o) :
     Opens a door or chest.  If locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based
on your disarming ability.  If you open a trapped chest without disarming the
traps first, they will activate.  Some doors will be jammed shut and may have to
be bashed open.  This command takes a full turn.
     You may just the "easy_open" option to open doors that you walk into.

Close a door (c) :
     Some monsters cannot open doors, so shutting them can be quite useful.
Broken doors cannot be closed.  This command takes a full turn.

Jam a door (j) / (S) :
     Many monsters can simply open closed doors, and can eventually get through
a locked door.  You may therefore occasionally want to jam a door shut with iron
spikes.  Each spike used on the door will make it harder to bash down the door,
up to a limit of eight.  This command takes a full turn.

Bash a door (B) / (f) :
     This command allows you to bash down jammed doors.  Your door bashing
ability increases with strength.  Bashing open a door can (briefly) throw you
off balance, makes a lot of noise, and sometimes ruins the door.  All doors can
be bashed; jammed or spiked doors will not open any other way.  You may also
bash chests.  This command takes a full turn.

Disarm a trap or chest / Desanctify a glyph (D) :
     You can attempt to disarm known traps or glyphs on the floor or on chests.
If you have a disarming skill close to the trap level, disarming by hand will be
safer than using magic; otherwise, magic is preferable.  If you fail to disarm a
trap, there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off.  This command
takes a full turn.

Alter (+) :
     This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select any of
the dungeon alteration commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open, disarm,
close), and, by using macros or keymaps, to combine this keypress with
directions.
     For burglars, it also allows stealing, door-locking, and setting traps.
This command takes a full turn.


--- Spell and Prayer Commands ---

Browse a book (b) / (P) :
     Open a readable book and read the spells.  You may select spells by
pressing their index letter; as you do, extra information appears (unless the
spell level is greater than your spellcasting skill).  This command takes no
time.

Gain new spells or prayers (G) :
     When you are able to learn new spells or prayers, the word "Study" will
appear on the status line at the bottom of the screen.  You then issue this
command and choose a book with unlearnt magics.  Pious characters get a prayer
at random; characters of all other realms may choose.  This command takes a full
turn.

Cast a spell or Pray a Prayer (m and p) :
     Casts a known spell or prayer.  This command takes a full turn.


--- Player Manipulation Commands ---

End/Default shapechange (]) :
     Returns you to your normal state if you have previously transformed
yourself into any creature.


--- Object Manipulation Commands ---

Eat some food (E) :
     Eat some food or a mushroom.  This command takes a full turn.

Fuel your lantern/torch (F) :
     You can refuel lanterns with flasks of oil and torches with other torches.
In general, two flasks will fully fuel a lantern and two torches will fully fuel
a torch.  This command takes half a turn.

Quaff a potion (q) :
     Drink a potion.  This command takes a full turn.

Read a scroll (r) :
     Read a scroll.  Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be
aborted (by pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll before it
disintegrates.  This command takes a full turn.

 Inscribe an object ({) :
     Inscribes an object.  The inscription appears inside curly braces after the
object description.  The inscription is limited to the particular object (or
pile) and is not automatically transferred to all similar objects, unless the
"Merge Inscriptions when Stacking" option is on.

Uninscribe an object (}) :
     Removes the inscription on an object.  This command will have no effect on
inscriptions added by the game itself (such as "{cursed}").


--- Magical Object Commands ---

Activate an object (A) :
     You have heard rumours of special wearable item deep in the Pits, ones that
can let you breath fire like a dragon or light rooms with just a thought.
Should you ever be lucky enough to find such an item, this command will let you
activate its special power.  This command takes a full turn.

Aim a wand (a) / (z) :
Use a staff (u) / (Z) :
Zap a rod (z) / (a) :
     Uses the indicated kind of magical device.  This command takes a full turn.


--- Throwing and Missile Weapons ---

Fire an item (f) / (t) :
     You may fire ammunition if you are wielding a missile weapon that uses it.
See the non-magical combat section for more information.  This command takes a
full turn unless you are using a weapon of extra shots.

Throw an item (v) :
     You may throw any object carried by your character.  See the non-magical
combat section for more information.  This command takes a full turn.

Targeting Mode (*) :
     This command allows you to aim directly at a specific monster or grid.  See
above for more information.


--- Information Commands ---

Full screen map (M) :
     Shows a map of the entire dungeon, usually reduced by a factor of nine, on
the screen.  Only the major dungeon features will be visible because of the
scale, so even some important objects may not show up.  This is particularly
useful in locating where the stairs are relative to your current position, or
for identifying unexplored areas of the dungeon.  This command takes no time.

Locate player on map (L) / (W) :
     This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors of the
current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point the map will be
re-centered on the player if necessary.  To scroll the map around, press any of
the direction keys.  The top line will display the sector location, and the
offset from your current sector.  This command takes no time.
     This command also has another use:  it automatically adjusts the map panel
to give you a better view in your direction of travel.  If worried about
offscreen monsters with nasty ranged attacks, this is one way to protect
yourself.

Look around (l) / (x) :
     This command is used to look around at nearby monsters (to determine their
type, health, and carried objects) and objects (to determine their type).  It
can also be used to find out what objects (if any) are under monsters or traps,
if a monster is currently inside a wall, and what is under the player.  See the
description of targeting mode for more information.  This command takes no time.

Observe an item (I) :
     This command provides extra object information.  If you know nothing about
the object, you see generic information about the object kind.  If you have
identified or otherwise know the object, a object description will also often
appear.  If you have fully *identified* an object, you will recall all the
special object attributes.  This command takes no time.


--- Message Commands ---

Repeat level feeling (Ctrl-F) :
     Displays your feeling about the dungeon level.  If you are currently on a
quest, a description of it will also appear.  This command takes no time.

View previous messages (Ctrl-P) :
     This command shows you all the recent messages.  You can scroll through
them or exit with ESCAPE.  This command takes no time.

Take notes (:) :
     This command allows you to take notes, which will then appear in your
message list (prefixed with "Note:").  This command takes no time.


--- Saving and Exiting Commands ---

Save and Quit (Ctrl-X) :
     Saves your character to file and exits the game.  Save files will also be
generated (hopefully) if the game crashes due to various errors.  After you die,
you can use your savefile to play again with the same options, monster memory,
etc.

Save (Ctrl-S) :
     This command saves the game but doesn't exit it.  Use this frequently (or
turn on the autosave option) if you are paranoid about having your computer
crash (or your power go out) while you are playing.

Quit (commit suicide) (Q or Ctrl-K) :
     Kills your character and exits the game.  You will be prompted to make sure
you really want to do this, and then asked to verify that choice.  Note that
dead characters are dead forever.


--- Information Commands ---

Character Description (C) :
     Brings up a full description of your character.  From this screen, you can
change names, reveiw attributes, or save your character status to file.

Check knowledge (~) :
     This command allows you to ask about the knowledge possessed by your
character.  Currently, this includes being able to display the high scores, list
all known artifacts, uniques, objects, the foes you have slain, and the contents
of your home.

Help (?) :
     Brings up the on-line help system.

Identify Symbol (/) :
     Use this command to find out what a character represents.  For instance, by
pressing "/", then ".", you will learn that the "." symbol stands for a floor
spot.  If you press return, you'll see a list of special uses for this command.
     If the character stands for a creature, you are asked if you want to recall
details.  If you answer yes, information about the creatures you have
encountered with that symbol is shown in the Recall window if available, or on
the screen if not.  You can also answer "k" to see the list sorted by number of
kills, or "p" to see the list sorted by dungeon level the monster is normally
found on.  Pressing ESCAPE at any point will exit this command.

Game Version (V) :
 This command will tell you what version of the game you are playing.


--- Preferences Commands ---

Interact with options (=) :
     Interact with options.  See the options section for more information.

Interact with macros (@) :
     Interact with macros.  See the macro and keymaps section for more
information.

Interact with visuals (%) :
     Interact with visuals.  See the visuals section for more information.

Interact with colors (&) :
     Interact with colors.  This command only works on some systems.  See the
visuals section for more information.

Interact with multimedia (!) :
     Adjust sound volume, change between graphics and text, and any other things
that the port of the game you are using allows.  This command only works on some
systems.  See the visuals section for more information.


--- Extra Commands ---

Toggle Choice Window (Ctrl-E) :
     Toggles the display in any sub-windows (if available) which are displaying
your inventory or equipment.

Redraw Screen (Ctrl-R) :
     This command adapts to various changes in global options, and redraws all
of the windows.  It is normally only necessary in abnormal situations, such as
after changing the visual attr/char mappings, or enabling graphics mode.

Load screen dump (left-paren) :
     This command loads a "snap-shot" of the current screen from a file and
displays it on the screen.

Save screen dump (right-paren) :
     This command dumps a "snap-shot" of the current screen to a file, including
encoded color information.

Repeat last command (n) or ([) :
     Repeats the previous command, selecting the same objects, spells, etc., you
choose last time.


Special Keys:
     Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results.  In general, these special keys are control
keys; often you can disable their special effects.

     It is often possible to specify "control-keys" without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret ("^") followed by the key.  This is useful
for specifying control-key commands that might be caught by the operating system
as explained above.

     Pressing backslash ("\") before a command will bypass all keymaps, and the
next keypress will be interpreted as an underlying command key.  The backslash
key is useful for creating macro actions which are not affected by any keymap
definitions that may be in force; for example, the three-character sequence
"\.6" will always mean "run east", even if the "." key has been mapped to a
different underlying command.

System-specific notes:
     If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-C will interrupt
the game.  The second and third interrupt will induce a warning bell, and the
fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message, since the fifth
will quit the game, after killing your character.  Also, Ctrl-Z will suspend the
game, and return you to the original command shell, until you resume the game
with the "fg" command.  There is now a compilation option to force the game to
prevent the "double ctrl-z escape death trick".  The Ctrl-\ and Ctrl-D and Ctrl-
S keys should not be intercepted.



====== Options ======

Various concepts mentioned below
  "disturb"    : cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands
  "flush"      : forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue, including
                 any macros in progress
  "fresh"      : dump any pending output to the screen

Options you may want to change to your preferences include:
- Roguelike commands, if you are used to the commands used in certain other
  roguelike games.
- Checking that the Hitpoint warning is non-zero can save your character's life.
- Set the delay factor to two or more if you want to see pretty ball
  explosions and whatnot.
- Playing around with the lighting options in the Visual Interface section
  can be a lot of fun.

Saving options:
     Whenever you save options, you have essentially three choices of filenames:
- <<character's name>>.prf : affects only that character
- <<race name>>.prf        : affects all characters of that race
- user.prf                 : affects all of your characters

     These rules also apply to other kinds of preferences.

     You may only change birth options when starting up a new character.

Allow specification of minimal stats          [birth_autoroll]  (on) :
     Allows you to specify minimum stats when creating a character.  Characters
are randomly generated until one is found to meet your requirements.

Restrict the use of stairs/recall             [birth_ironman]   (off) :
     Can never go up.  Can never use recall until you win the game.  No stairs
are ever placed under you when you change levels.  Adds 40% to score.

Ironman Play:
     "Go down into the dungeon.  Return with Morgoth's Crown or not at all."
In Ironman mode, you can never go up any staircase, and can never return to the
surface by any means, until victorious.  If by accident you do, you must
immediately return to the dungeon.
     Some forms of Ironman play require that you visit no stores before going
into the dungeon, or that you must use a down staircase as soon as you see it
("crash-dive ironman"), but they are variants on the basic theme.

Lock the doors of stores and the home         [birth_no_stores]  (off) :
     Cannot use any stores or your home.  If you are not playing ironman, adds
15% to score.

Do not create artifacts                       [birth_no_artifacts]  (off) :
     No artifacts will appear.  Adds 10% to score.

No stairs back the way you came               [birth_no_return_stair]  (off) :
     Never generate a staircase back to the level you came from, even if you
used a staircase.  If you are not playing ironman, adds 5% to score.

Monsters exploit players weaknesses           [birth_smart_cheat]  (off) :
     Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, without
having to learn them by trial and error, and to use this information to choose
the best attacks.  Adds 7% to score.


--- Option Set #1:  Game Behavior ---

Rogue-like commands                           [rogue_like_commands]  (off) :
     Selects the "roguelike" command set, which uses eight of the letter keys to
move the character about.  This command set can be really useful if you have no
number pad, and some people just naturally prefer it.  However, the original
command set has considerably more unused keys available for macros and keymaps.

Verify destruction of objects                 [verify_destroy]  (on) :
     Gives you an "are you sure" message when you try to destroy an object.

Pick things up by default                     [always_pickup]  (off) :
     When you walk onto any object, you will attempt to pick it up.  Note the
"-" command, which can be used to reverse this option for a single turn.
     Because picking up objects always takes time (1/10th of a turn for every
object picked up, unless you are staying still), it is recommended that you also
turn on "query_floor".

Display things before picking them up         [query_floor]  (on) :
     The game will display more information about objects you walk on, including
their weight.
     If you have the "always_pickup" option on, it will prompt you to pick up
objects.  If you don't, it will simply display a list.

Never haggle in stores                        [never_haggle]  (off) :
     You never haggle in stores, regardless of the markup the shopkeeper asks
(which can be as great as 33% on extremely valuable items).

Use old target by default                     [use_old_target]  (off) :
     Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the current
target if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous if you target
locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

Run past stairs                               [run_ignore_stairs]  (on) :
     Ignore stairs when running.

Run through open doors                        [run_ignore_doors]  (on) :
     Ignore open doors when running.

Run past known corners                        [run_cut_corners]  (off) :
     Cut sharply around known corners when running.  This will result in faster
running (which matters if you are fleeing), but may cause you to run into a
lurking monster.

Merge inscriptions when stacking              [stack_force_notes]  (on) :
     Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty
inscription and the other does not.  The resulting stack keeps the non-empty
inscription.

Merge discounts when stacking                 [stack_force_costs]  (off) :
     Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have different
discounts.  The resulting stack keeps the largest discount.

Allow quantity specification                  [allow_quantity]  (on) :
    Prompt for a quantity when necessary, instead of defaulting to a single
object.  If you prefer to enter command counts before commands instead of typing
quantities when prompted, turn this option off.


--- Option Set #2:  Disturbance and Warning ---

Disturb whenever any monster moves            [disturb_move]  (on) :
     Disturb the player when any visible monster moves, appears, or disappears,
whether in line of sight or out of it.

Disturb whenever viewable monster moves       [disturb_near]  (on) :
     Disturb the player when any viewable (visible and in direct line of sight)
monster moves, whenever any monster becomes viewable, and whenever any viewable
monster becomes no longer viewable.

Disturb whenever map panel changes            [disturb_panel]  (on) :
     This option causes you to be disturbed by the screen scrolling, as it does
when your character gets close to the edge of the screen.

Disturb whenever player state changes         [disturb_state]  (on) :
     This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state changes,
including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

Disturb whenever boring things happen         [disturb_minor]  (on) :
     This option causes you to be disturbed by various minor things, including
monsters bashing down doors, beginning to run out of fuel, and changes in the
weather.

Alert user to critical hitpoints              [alert_hitpoint]  (on) :
     Make a noise and flush all pending input when your hitpoints reach the
hitpoint warning.  Make certain you also adjust the hitpoint warning.

Alert user to various failures                [alert_failure]  (off) :
     This option is currently unused.

Ring bell on error                            [ring_bell]  (on) :
     Attempt to make a "bell" sound upon various failures or illegal inputs.

Activate quick messages                       [quick_messages]  (on) :
     Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt, except
when you are badly wounded.

Compress messages in savefiles                [compress_savefile]  (off) :
     Compress the savefile, saving only the most recent player messages.  This
can cut the size of the savefile substantially, but will result in the loss of
message information.

Flush input on various failures               [flush_failure]  (on) :
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
failures occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand, etc.
This is very useful if you use macros that include directional components with
commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from walking towards monsters
when your spells fail.

Flush input whenever disturbed                [flush_disturb]  (on) :
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
character is disturbed.  This is useful if you use macros that take time, since
it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being attacked by a
monster.

Colored messages when hit hard                [colored_hit_msg]  (on) :
     The harder you are hit, the more colorful the damage message will be.

Special colors for hurt character             [colored_hurt_char]  (on) :
     Your character symbol will change color depending on your health.


--- Option Set #3:  Visual Interface ---

Map remembers all perma-lit grids             [view_perma_grids]  (on) :
     Memorize all perma-lit floor grids seen by the player.   This option allows
you to keep track of which explored floor grids were perma-lit.
     Turning off this option allows the player to always know which lit floor
grids are in line of sight, but (if you are using color) this is better
accomplished by the "view_sight_light" option.  Note that any non-floor grids
seen by the player are always memorized, and objects seen by the player are
memorized independently from the grid itself.

Map remembers all torch-lit grids             [view_torch_grids]  (off) :
     Memorize all floor grids which have ever been lit up by the player.

Use special colors for torch-lit grids        [view_torch_light]  (off) :
     If the option "view_floor_light" is also on, floor grids that are only lit
by the player's own light source will appear yellow.  If the option
"view_wall_light" is on, walls will be colored in the same way.  Turning this
option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for field of view          [view_sight_light]  (off) :
     If the option "view_floor_light" is also on, those floor grids that the
player can see directly appear white, and all other known grids appear dark
gray.  If the option "view_wall_light" is on, walls will be colored in the same
way.  Turning this option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for wall grids (slow)      [view_wall_light]  (off) :
     If either the option "view_torch_light" or "view_sight_light" is on, wall
grids will change color depending on lighting conditions instead of always being
gray.  This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have
been changed, or if graphics are being used.  Turning it off will slightly
increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for floor grids (slow)      [view_floor_light]  (off) :
     If either the option "view_torch_light" or "view_sight_light" is on, floor
grids will change color depending on lighting conditions instead of always being
black or white.  This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for floors
have been changed, or if graphics are being used.  Turning it off will slightly
increase the speed of the game.

Highlight the player with the cursor          [highlight_player]  (off) :
     Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on some UNIX
machines, but horrible on most graphics machines.

Flush output after various things             [fresh_after]  (off) :
     This option forces the game to flush all output not only after every player
command, but also after every round of processing monsters and objects, and
after every message.  This maximizes your information, but may slow down the
game (especially on slower machines) and on faster machines you cannot see the
results anyway.

Don't hide traps when objects pile on them    [traps_display_on_top]  (on) :
     Traps display on top of objects, and you need to look at the grid to
determine if any objects are underneath.  If this option is not selected,
objects hide traps.

Show dungeon level in feet (or meters)        [depth_in_feet]  (off) :
     Display dungeon depths in feet (meters if the "use_metric" option is used)
instead of levels.

Show labels in equipment listings             [show_labels]  (on) :
    Display "labels" (what an object is being used for) for objects in all
equipment listings.

Show weights in all object listings           [show_weights]  (on) :
     Display weights (in pounds or kilograms) of objects in all inventory,
equipment, store, and home listings.

Show flavors in object descriptions           [show_flavors]  (on) :
     Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object descriptions and information
screens, even for objects whose type is known.  This does not affect objects in
stores.

Use Metric (SI) measurements                  [use_metric]  (off) :
     Display a variety of measurable quantities using metric measurements.
Conversions are:  3 meters ~ 10 feet, 1.0 kilograms ~ 2.2 pounds.

Menus pop up when selecting various things    [always show list]  (on) :
     If selecting anything from a list, that list will automatically pop up.



--- Option Set #4:  Screen Display ---

Window Flags:
     Some platforms support multiple windows, which can display all sorts of
useful information.  The best thing about these windows is that they are
(usually) updated automatically to reflect the current state of the world.

  inven/equip:       Display the player inventory (and equipment).
  equip/inven:       Display the player equipment (and inventory).
  character screen:  Display the main character screen.
  equipment flags:   Display the character screen's equipment flags section.
  messages:          Display recent messages and notes.
  overhead view:     Display an overhead view of the dungeon.
  monster recall:    Display a description of the target monster.
  object recall:     Display a description of the most recently selected
       object.  Currently this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks.  This
       window flag may be usefully combined with others, such as monster recall.
  snap-shot:        This window flag is currently unused.

Screen Layout:

Force 25_line mode:   (on) :
     The main screen will appear in 25 lines, using a font higher than it is
wide.  If this option is off, the main screen will appear in 50 lines, using a
font of equal width and height.

Number of rows used to show the dungeon:  (22) :
     If force_25_line mode is on, the dungeon will always appear in 22 rows.
Otherwise, it may appear in 22, 33, or 44 rows.  The reason why dungeon display
rows are always divisible by 11 is that rooms align to 11x33 blocks.
     There are three great advantages to showing the dungeon in 44 rows:
Firstly, you are guaranteed 20 grids of clear viewing in your direction of
travel whenever you hit the 'L' (or 'W') key.  Secondly, even the biggest rooms
fit within a screen 44 grids high and 66 wide.  Thirdly, you have more space for
custom display rows.

Minimum vertical view distance:    (2)  :
     Fully documented on-screen.

Minimum horizontal view distance:  (4) :
     Fully documented on-screen.

Customized left panel rows:   (none preset) :
     Below the monster health bar on the left side of the main screen are a
number of empty rows in which you can display information.  A few of these
duplicate information also shown below the main map.
     The single most useful display item is that showing the closest monster;
with it active, you need never be surprised by an offscreen breather again.


--- Option Set #5:  Difficulty and Cheating ---

Peek into object creation                     [cheat_peek]  (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

Peek into monster creation                    [cheat_hear]  (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at monster creation.

Peek into dungeon creation                    [cheat_room]  (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at room creation.

Know complete monster info                    [cheat_know]  (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

Allow player to avoid death                   [cheat_live]  (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.


--- Miscellaneous Options ---

Hitpoint warning:
     If non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints (x10) that you start
get special warnings and cannot use most keys to clear messages.  It is also
used as the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana, and (if
the "colored hurt char" option is active) for displaying your character in red.

Delay Factor:
     The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects
used for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks.  The actual time delay is equal
to "delay_factor" squared, in milliseconds.

Autosave:
     You may set the game to save your character every so often by using the
autosave option.  Tweak the timer until you are satisfied.



====== Inscriptions ======

     You use the '{' and '}' keys to inscribe and uninscribe objects.  The
inscription on an object can have all sorts of effects:

To designate a main and backup weapon:
     Inscribe both with "@w0".  The 'X' command will replace whatever melee
weapon you are wielding with another so inscribed.  You may also inscribe these
or other weapons with "@w1", etc., and wield weapons 0, 1, 2 and so on as
desired.

To have a given command always use the same spellbook:
     Inscribe it with "@m#", or "@p#", replacing the '#' with whatever digit you
desire.  This allows you to set up macros to cast a spell knowing that it will
never choose the wrong book.  Similar inscriptions make archery very convenient,
and allow you to always use a given magical device with the same keystrokes.

     In general, if you inscribe anything with @<<any command>><<any digit>>,
you can issue the command, type the digit, and use the first legal inscribed
object.

To automatically use a given object with a given command:
     Inscribe the object with "@X*", where 'X' is the letter of that command in
the underlying keyset.

To prevent accidental use of an object with any command:
     Inscribe it with "!x", where 'x' is the letter you type to issue that
command.  If you are very paranoid, inscribe it with "!*"

To learn when an object that recharges automatically is ready for use:
     Inscribe it with "!!".  This is handy for everything from your Rod of Trap
Detection to dragon scale mail.

To automatically pick up an object:
     Inscribe it with "=g".  Especially useful for anything you throw.

To give a object a special name:
     A shovel inscribed "#named 'Deepdelver'" will be called "a Shovel named
'Deepdelver'".  One inscribed "@w0#'Deepdelver'" will be called "a Shovel
'Deepdelver' {@w0}".  This part of the inscription should always go last.

Inscriptions for fun and profit:
     Try inscribing the first monster killed by a weapon, hidden object
abilities (once you discover them), and where you found the item or who dropped
it.

Automatic inscriptions:
     The game also inscribes objects automatically.  Some of these inscriptions
will disappear when the item is identified, and you may overwrite others.

  "broken"         :  Object is broken in some way.
  "cursed"         :  Object is cursed.
  "empty"          :  Object has no more charges (and you know this).
  "indestructible" : Object cannot be destroyed.
  "tried"          :  Used an object, didn't learn anything about it.
  "50% off"        :  Object is worth 50% less than normal.



====== Macros and keymaps ======

Quick Tutorial:
     Necromancers are forever casting spell "a", Magic Bolt, in spellbook "a",
Beginner's Curses.  In both keysets, that's "maa", plus "*" to enter targeting
mode, and finally "t" to target.  Wouldn't it be nice if you could do all this
with a single keypress? You can.
     Choose an unused command (we shall pick "'" by way of example).  Bring up
the macro/keymap screen by typing "@".  Press "4" to create a macro, and the
game will ask you for a trigger.  Type "'".  You then shift to the action field,
where you input all the commands you want "'" to perform when pressed.  In this
case, you would enter:  "maa*t", and press return.
     Now save your new macro by typing "2", and either allow the game to choose
your character's name for the preference file, or (if you want all of your
characters to use the same keymap) save to "user.prf".

     This is only the beginning.  What you can do with a spell, you can do with
arrows, Rods of Trap Location, resting, activating stuff, talents, searching;
all sorts of command combinations can profitably be macroed.  Macros are even
more flexible when used in combination with object inscriptions.
     In all cases, you remember the exact series of keypresses you need to
issue, pick an unused trigger key, and fill in the action field.


--- Examples ---

     Macros are so handy that players (Jim Lyon in particular) have compiled
lists of helpful tricks.

To clear any pending messages:
     Insert some "\e"s (escapes) before and/or after your macros.  Be careful
about skipping past important info!  If you want to be a little more careful,
use "\s"s (spaces) instead.

To learn how to represent any key:
     Some keys cannot be entered simply as numbers or letters.  To figure out
how to include the escape key in an action, for example, you bring up the
macro/keymap screen, type 3: Query a macro, and press escape (ESC) when asked
for a trigger.  This will tell you that an escape is represented by "\e".

Rest as needed:
     Macro a trigger key to "R*\r".  This is also helpful when waiting for a
monster to approach, because you recover mana and HPs twice as quickly than when
staying in place.

Fire ammunition from quiver slot 0 (zero) at the closest monster:
     Macro a trigger key to "f0.".  If you get too many messages afterwards, you
can also add some '\s's.

Activate the Phial:
     Macro a trigger key to "Af\s\s".

Destroy an item or a pile on the floor:
     Macro a trigger key to "099\rk-.y".  This expands to
  '0'  - enter a command count.
  '99' - enter the maximum possible quantity.
  '\r' - press return.
  'k'  - issue the kill command (in the roguelike keymap, this would be ^D).
  '-'  - choose the floor.
  '.'  - choose the top floor item (never chooses anything in inventory).
  'y'  - confirm the kill.


--- In Depth ---

     Macros allow you to use a single key to activate actions normally requiring
several keypresses.  In the first example above, we macroed "'" to "maa*t".
Macros only activate when you issue a command.  Macros are often affected by
keymaps; you may bypass keymaps in macros by putting a "\" before any key.
     Most of the time you will be creating macros.

     Keymaps are different.  Like macros, they map any number of keypresses to a
single key; unlike macros, you use underlying (base) commands, and the keymap
fires off in almost all situations (the major exception being other keymaps and
data-entry).  Keymaps are never affected by macros.
     Keymaps are used by the game to map underlying commands to both the
original and the roguelike keysets.  Unless you get pretty serious about game
customization, you will seldom need to use them.

Not all keys can be entered as simple numbers or letters:
  \e     : escape  (useful for clearing the message line)
  \r     : return
  \n     : newline (is normally treated the same as return)
  \s     : space (' ')
  \\     : backslash  ('\')
  \^     : caret ('^')
  ^X     : control-X  (other control keys use the same system)
  \x80   : character in position 0x80 (in hex:  decimal equivalent would be 128)

Listing of underlying commands:
     Underlying commands are usually the same as those in the original keyset,
but there are important exceptions:

  Underlying command     Original keyset     Roguelike
  5                      ,                   .
  .                      .                   ,
  ;1  (move = ';')       1                   b
  ;2                     2                   j
  ;3                     3                   n

  ^V                     n                   '



====== Preferences ======

     Information about options, usage of extra windows, command macros, and
keymaps can all be stored in preference files.  In addition, you can customize
the game in many other ways and save these preferences to file.


--- The priority order of preference files ---

     Whenever the game starts up, and whenever it creates or loads a character,
it opens various preference files and modifies various things according to
instructions in them.  The preference files below are listed in descending order
of priority:  anything in higher files overrides anything in a file below it.

     Be aware that these rules apply only for this variant.

"/lib/user/<<base name of character>>.prf"
     May contain options, color definitions, attr/char remappings (what
monsters, objects, and features look like), and many other things.  Anything in
this file is guaranteed to override anything in any other file.
     What is the "base name" of your character?  It is the name of your
character, usually with non-alphabetic, non-numeric characters translated to
'_'s, and (on Windows and DOS) shortened to eight characters.  You may check the
base name by trying to save macros or keymaps.

Your character's savefile
     Always contains your current options and window settings.  Never contains
macros, keymaps, or visual preferences (these all need to be saved in an
external file).  Options saved in a savefile will (usually) remain active even
after the character dies and is reborn.  The major exception is the cheating
options:  they are reset.

"/lib/user/user.prf"
     Any preferences that you want to apply to all of your characters should go
here.


     Many players need no other preference files and can stop reading here.


"lib/pref/user.prf"
     This file is loaded just before the one above it.  Links to system-specific
user-preference files, which tend to be used by porters to customize the game in
ways that they think users of their system will appreciate.  For example, "user-
mac.prf" includes a bunch of extra macros.

"lib/pref/font.prf":  The basic text-mode preference file.
     Links to font.xxx.prf, which defines the exact colors for all spells and
objects in text mode, and contains the default colors used to display object
descriptions in inventory (wizard books are light red, necro books are purple,
etc.).
     Also links to system-specific text-mode preference files (font-ibm.prf,
font-win.prf, etc.).  Each of these files assigns new text-mode characters and
attributes (colors) for objects, monsters, features, etc.  For example, "font-
ibm.prf" changes dungeon walls from '#'s to solid blocks.

"lib/pref/graf.prf":  The basic graphics-mode preference file.
     Links to font.xxx.prf (but later overrides a lot of the information it
contains).
     Also links to system-specific graphics-mode preference files, all of which
then link to one of two files:
graf-xxx.prf:  The preference file used for 8x8 graphics.
     Each color of objects and spell effects, and each individual terrain and
monster, are assigned their own graphical representation.
graf-new.prf:  The preference file used for Adam Bolt's 16x16 graphics.

"lib/pref/pref.prf":
     This is the source of most default settings except for char/attr
remappings.  It contains the default values of options, the keymaps for the
original and roguelike keysets, and the default inventory colors.  Links to the
file "message.prf", which controls the colors of messages.  Links to system-
specific general preference files (pref-x11.prf, pref-gcu.prf, etc.).  These
contain system-specific keymappings and allow the game to recognize your
keyboard.

message.prf:  Message colors.
     Each message can be assigned to a type; each type may have one or more
sounds and a color associated with it.


--- Writing your own preference files ---

     All preference files use a common system to store information.  You must be
careful of two things:
1) Make sure that the file will actually be loaded.  It needs to be one of the
files mentioned above, or be called by one of those files.
2) Watch out for automatic preference dumps.  If you try to edit anything
between the special markers, your changes will be lost.  The solution is to skip
past all the automatic stuff, and put your changes at the bottom, below the last
marker.

List of preference file instructions:

%:human.prf      :  open up the file "/pref/human.prf" or "/user/human.prf"
     and read it.  If both files exist, rules in the latter takes priority.

R:0:w/@          :  The monster, with index 0 (zero), will be white ('w'),
     and be represented with a '@'.

R:0:0x8C/0x80    : The monster, with index 0 (zero), will get the graphical
     tile at position (0x8C - 0x80), (0x80 - 0x80) = row 12, column 0.  Note
     that values above 0x7F (127) indicate the use of graphics.

K:50:v/~         :  The object, with index 50, will be violet ('v'), and be
     represented with a '~'.

K:50:0x83/0x96   : The object, with index 50, will get the graphical
     tile at position (0x83 - 0x80), (0x96 - 0x80) = row 3, column 22.

F:1:1/249        :  The feature, with index 1, will be white (color 1), and
     be represented by the character in ASCII position 249 (a centered dot),
     when the game is in 25-line mode.

f:1:250          :  The feature, with index 1, will be represented by the
     character in ASCII position 250 (a small centered dot), when the game
     is in 50-line mode.

S:0xB1:0x01/0x2D : Index B1 (177) of the flavor table will contain the color
     1 (white) and the character in ASCII position 45 ('-').  A detailed
     look at how the flavor table works is beyond the scope of this document;
     suffice it to say that all characters used to display spell effects, and
     all object kinds with flavors, get 16 entries in the flavor table, one
     for each color.

E:90:0x0C        : Tval 90 (wizard spellbooks) will display in the inventory
     and various listing as color 0x0C (light red).

A:R*\r           : The next key listed will be mapped to this set of
     actions (can be either a keymap or a macro).

C:0:x            : The previous action listed is a keymap, is active in the
     original keyset (set 0), and will be activated by typing 'x'.

P:1:^O           : The previous action listed is a macro, is active in the
     roguelike keyset (set 1), and will be activated by typing control-'O'.

V:1:0x00:0xff:0xff:0xff   :  The color in position 1 (white), will have a
     special value of 0x00 (zero), a red-value of 0xff (255), a green-value
     of 0xff, and a blue-value of 0xff.

X:rogue_like_commands  :  The "rogue_like_commands" option will be off.

Y:rogue_like_commands  :  The "rogue_like_commands" option will be on.

W:2:6:1          : Window 2 (the third one), will display window display #6
     (display messages), and be active (1) as opposed to inactive (0).

M:1:w            : Message type 1 (standard hit message) will appear white.

D:4              : The delay factor will be 4 (squared).

H:3              : The hitpoint warning will be at 30%.

a:1:1000         : Autosave is on; games will be saved every 1000 turns.

T:1:0:22:2:4     : the main window will appear in 25-line mode, we will not
     be using 50 rows to display help and other things, the dungeon will
     display in 22 rows, the number of rows from the vertical edge at which
     the map scrolls will be 2, and the number of rows from the horizontal
     edge at which the map scrolls will be 4.

T:0:22:2:4       : Same, except that the main window will use 50 screen rows.

?:<<text>>       : A conditional expression.  If true, allows another
     line to activate.  The tests include:
  AND     - logical AND
  IOR     - inclusive OR
  EQU     - (string) equals
  NOT     - logical negation
  LEQ     - (string) less than or equal to
  GEQ     - (string) greater than or equal to
  [,]     - group expressions
  $CLASS  - current class
  $GRAF   - 3-letter graphics abbr in "graf-***.prf" (old, new)
  $PLAYER - current player name
  $RACE   - current race
  $SYS    - 3-letter system abbr in "pref-***.prf" (ami, mac, win,...)
     See the usage in "lib/pref/pref.prf", etc.



====== Visuals, colors, and multimedia ======

Interact with Visuals:  (command: '%') :
     You may adjust the character and attribute (color) used to display objects,
monsters, and terrain features.
  1) Update your preferences with a specific user preference file.
  2) Save your current monster visuals to file.
  3) Save your current object visuals to file.
  4) Save your current terrain visuals to file.
  6) Change monster visuals.
  7) Change object visuals.
  8) Change terrain visuals.
  0) Reset visuals to their last saved values (undo all changes).

     When changing visuals, you may type the following keys:
  n: advance one (wrap around if at the end)
  N: go back one (wrap around if at the beginning)
  a: change to the next color (wrap around if at color 15)
  A: change to the previous color (wrap around if at color 0)
  c: change to the next character in the ASCII sequence (wrap around if at 255)
  C: change to the previous character (wrap around if at 0)

     A good way to get used to the interface is to choose option 6:  change
monster visuals, note that the first "monster" is your character, and change it
from a white '@' to something silly.  Leave, see how weird you look, come back,
and (if you like) press '0' to reset the visuals.


Interact with colors:  (command '&') :
     In the interact with colors display, you have three options available:
  1) Update your preferences with a specific user preference file.
  4) Save your colors to file.
  3) Change colors.

     When changing colors, you may issue the following commands:
  n: go to the next color (wrap around if at 255)
  N: go back one (wrap around if at 0)
  k: change a value (possibly the gamma correction?)
  K: change a value (possibly the gamma correction?)
  r: increase the red in this color (wraps around at hex value 0xff)
  R: decrease the red in this color (wraps around at hex value 0x00)
  g: increase the green in this color (wraps around at hex value 0xff)
  G: decrease the green in this color (wraps around at hex value 0x00)
  b: increase the blue in this color (wraps around at hex value 0xff)
  B: decrease the blue in this color (wraps around at hex value 0x00)

     Note that, while the game is theoretically capable of using more than 16
colors, it is not currently set up to do so.  Also, color 0 should not be
changed.


Interact with multimedia:  (command '!') :
     Some ports of this game (but not all) will play sounds and music.  If your
port is one of them, you can adjust volumes, turn sounds off and on entirely,
and tweak various other things.




============================= Combat and Magic =============================


====== Non-magical Combat ======

     Without using magic, you may attack monsters in hand-to-hand (melee)
combat, by using missile weapons, or by throwing objects at them.


--- Quick Review ---

1) Sabre (1d7)
   1 die rolling 7.  The average damage of a die with 7 sides is 4.
   (seven plus one, divided by two, is four).

2) Gets a critical hit (an average critical hit might add two extra dice).
   3 dice rolling 7, each with an average value of 4.

3) If you get special damage multipliers (from, say, your missile launcher),
   apply to the average value of the damage dice you roll.

4) Roll three dice, each with an average of 4, to get an average damage of 12.

5) Player has a Deadliness value shown on his character screen of 50%.
   12 + 50% bonus  -->  12 + 6  -->  average damage of 18.

6) Finally, the special bonus for troll slaying weapons against trolls is added.
   18 + 16 bonus  -->  average damage of 34.

     Missile and throwing weapons work exactly the same way, except that the
first benefit from a launcher multiplier and the second from a special thrown
weapons multiplier.


--- Melee (weapons) ---

Number of Blows:
     On the left side of your character screen is displayed the number of blows
you can get per turn.  If you are wielding no weapon, you get two blows.  If
your weapon is too heavy for you to wield properly, you get one blow.
Otherwise, you get between two and six blows, depending solely on weapon weight,
Dexterity, and Strength.  It is possible for items to give you extra blows.

Your Weapon:
     All weapons have damage dice displayed after their name (1d4, 2d5, etc.);
they are its single most important attribute, the expression of what is like to
wield in battle.
     Edged weapons, pole-mounted weapons, and blunt weapons each use a separate
skill.  You may 'I'nspect the weapon to learn what skill it uses.

Combat Skill:
     You need to have enough Skill to hit monsters regularly; do what it takes
to keep it high.  All equipped items - other than your missile launcher and
ammunition - can affect your melee Skill.  Many other factors can make you
better or worse in combat, but the display on your character screen tracks
almost all of them.

Critical Hits:
     Your total combat Skill not only allows you to even hit a monster, but also
determines how often you get critical hits.  Critical hits are vital for any
serious fighter using any weapon, especially ones rolling few dice.  You know
you just got a critical hit when you get any combat message other than "you hit
the <<monster name>>".
     In melee, critical hits add between two and five dice; in archery or when
using throwing weapons, they add between one and three.

Deadliness:
     Deadliness acts as a percentage bonus to damage (you may inspect your
current bonus on the character screen).  High-level characters may have bonuses
of 200% displayed on their character screens, and therefore triple the damage
they do with the Deadliness multiplier alone.  All equipped items can affect
your Deadliness.

Brands and Slays:
     Some remarkable weapons do extra damage to various kinds of  monsters; a
Dagger of Fire, for instance, would do extra damage to creatures not immune to
fire.  Slays, in contrast, do extra damage to particular monster races, so wield
that Mace of Orc Slaying if you come upon any orcs.  Only the best applicable
quality is used; they do not combine.
     Bonuses from slays and brands are applied after all other damage
adjustments, except monster resistances.


--- Melee (unarmed) ---

Unarmed Combat:
     The unarmed combat methods, Karate and Wrestling, are known as martial
arts.  When using a martial art, you always get two blows.  Martial arts do not
depend on equipment, and get no permanent bonuses from other equipped items.
     They are effective against almost all sorts of monsters, are relatively
inexpensive to learn, and really come into their own against monsters that seem
to resist everything.  But be warned!  You need to be blessed (Scrolls of
Blessing work) to do damage to non-material beings, and touching certain kinds
of monsters can be quite painful...
     You can get (temporary) slays and brands with martial arts.  You can also
get critical hits on occasion, especially if you have skill in Piety, Blood
Dominion, or Nature Lore, or get vorpal blows or sneak attacks.

Damage Display:
     The melee section of your character screen changes when you use a martial
art.  Instead of displaying Skill and Deadliness, it shows the approximate
average damage you did with your last ten or twenty hits.  If your skill,
strength, or dexterity change significantly, you have to engage in combat to get
more accurate figures.

The Martial Arts:
     Wrestling depends on your skill and strength.  Raise both high enough, and
you can do a large amount of pure damage.  Wrestlers can often throw or tackle
their foes, robbing them of energy (and thus effectively slowing them down).
     Karate depends on skill, dexterity, and (to a lesser degree) strength.
While it doesn't do as much direct damage as wrestling, no other combat method
can hinder your foes quite as much.  Given enough skill, you can stun, slow, or
confuse your foes - and a hindered monster may soon enough be a dead one.

Special notes:
     Most scrolls, potions, spells, or talents that grant extra powers or
abilities to melee are fully effective when used with martial arts.


--- Shooting ---

     Ranged fire with missile launchers is a non-magical method of doing damage
at a safe distance.

Setting up to Shoot:
     Slings shoot shots and seeker shots, bows shoot arrows and seeker arrows,
and crossbows shoot bolts and seeker bolts.  Simply equip the weapon and keep
plenty of the ammo on hand and you're ready.

The Quiver Slots:
     Ammo is best kept in special quiver slots.  You may "wield" up to ten
different groups of ammo, then fire them just as you would those in the
backpack.  Ammo in the quiver will use space in your backpack.

Shooting:
     You shoot at a monster by typing 'f' (or 't' in the rogue-like command
set), then selecting a missile you would like to fire.  This activates the
targeting interface described in the section on commands.

Number of Shots:
     On the right side of your character screen is displayed the number of shots
you can get per turn.  The number of shots depends on skill, plus any bonus
shots that the weapon provides.  Extra shots are not fired all at once; instead,
each shot takes less time, making monsters appear to move in slow motion.

Your Launcher:
     All launchers have a multiplier to damage:  for example, a Longbow (x3)
would multiply the normal damage of the ammo it fires by three.  This multiplier
is applied before the brand/slay bonus and after everything else.

Brands and Slays:
     Ammo can have bonuses to Skill and to Deadliness, and occasionally possess
the same kinds of slays and brands found on melee weapons.  Missile launchers
are also capable of imparting slays and brands.


--- Throwing ---

     Throwing objects requires less skill than using missile weapons, and can be
an important combat method.  For novice adventurers, throwing flasks of oil and
boulders can be a life-saver, and there are rumours of objects deep in the
dungeon that can do large amounts of damage when thrown.  All objects have
damage dice, but most do not display them.  If you think an object should do
nasty things to your foes, it's certainly worth trying to throw it at them, just
to see if anything happens.

Getting ready to throw:
     To throw an object, you use the 'v' command and select any item in your
backpack, on your person, or on the floor.  This activates the targeting
interface described in the section on commands.

Number of throws:
     You may never throw more than one item per turn.

Special throwing weapons:
     A boulder with damage dice of 10d9 does an average of 50 damage.  It gets
no Skill or Deadliness bonuses from equipment, no slays or brands, and cannot
get critical hits.
     However, special throwing weapons (weapons like throwing knives and
javelins that are designed for throwing), get the following advantages:
- They benefit from all Skill and Deadliness bonuses other than those granted by
your melee and missile weapons.
- They may have slays or brands.
- They not infrequently get critical hits.
- They get a special damage multiplier.  This ranges from 2 1/2 to 10, depending
  on throwing skill and whether you are a specialist spellcaster, a specialist
  warrior, or anyone else.  Perfectly balanced weapons (marked "well-balanced")
  increase this multiplier by 50%.
- They seldom break when thrown (just be careful not to use them in melee).

Potions:
     Another way to make good use of a high throwing skill is to hurl potions at
your foes.  The damage they do (or the power they have) depends on potion type
and your throwing skill.



--- Getting good at combat ---

     Non-magical combat can be very powerful, but only if you work at it.  You
increase the damage you do by:

1) Raising your base damage dice.  Increasing the number of dice both adds
damage and makes the attack more reliable (because the damage done is more
likely to be close to the average).  Increasing dice sides adds damage without
affecting reliability.

2) Increasing your total combat Skill.  This may mean
- increasing your melee or missile skills,
- getting better plusses to Skill from equipment,
- wielding a lighter weapon,
- choosing a weapon that your race prefers, or
- using spells and objects that temporarily enhance your abilities.
     This last can make all the difference when fighting tough monsters.

3) Getting more critical hits.  Critical hits are important; the fewer base dice
your weapon or ammo has, the more important they are.  It is quite easy to
double the average damage you do with critical hits alone.  You can get more
criticals by:
- raising your total Skill,
- attacking sleeping monsters (especially if you are in sneaking mode!),
- increasing your piety, nature lore, or blood dominion skills, or
- wielding vorpal weapons.

4) Increasing your Deadliness.  Deadliness may not seem powerful at first, but
it can eventually triple the damage you do on every blow.  Once you get your
base damage and critical hits up high enough, Deadliness can make you
formidable.

5) Having the right slay or brand for the job.  If you're serious about melee,
have more than one weapon on hand.  Also, watch out for resistant monsters.

6) Taking the Oath of Iron.  The advantages include:
- better bonuses to missile weapon multiplier and shooting speed.
- better thrown weapon multiplier.
- better critical hit bonuses from piety, nature lore, and blood dominion.
- better wrestling and karate damage.
- can handle heavy weapons much more easily.
- no limits to combat-related skill raises.


--- Winning "unwinnable" fights ---

     Some monsters are simply too tough to just clobber; fortunately, there are
scrolls, potions, mushrooms, and magical devices that can turn a losing battle
into a major victory.  If your enemies seem too tough to kill now, maybe they
won't be after you've enhanced yourself and hindered them.


--- Details ---

Monster Susceptibilities:
- Susceptible to fire
     Bonus to damage of fire brand is increased by 50%.
- Susceptible to cold
     Bonus to damage of frost brand is increased by 50%.

Monster Resistances:
- Resistant to edged weapons
     Swords, polearms, arrows, and bolts do one-half damage.
- Almost immune to edged weapons
     Swords, polearms, arrows, and bolts do one-sixth damage.
- Resistant to blunt weapons
     Hafted weapons and sling shots do one-half damage.
- Almost immune to blunt weapons
     Hafted weapons and sling shots do one-sixth damage.

Vorpal/piercing and concussive weapons reduce the effect of all monster
resistances.


Noise-making:
     Combat is noisy.  The stealthier your are, and the higher your burglary
skill, the less extra noise you make.

Wielding two weapons:
     You can wield two weapons of the same type (edged, blunt, or pole-mounted
weapons), as long as both require only one hand to wield and, together, they are
relatively light (depends on your strength).  When wielding two weapons, your
total Skill drops significantly (depending on total weapon weight).
     If you wield two weapons, you get one chance to hit with each weapon.  For
each blow, you first attempt to hit with your primary weapon (the one held in
your sword arm) and, if that misses, your secondary weapon.  If one weapon runs
out of blows, you continue with the other until it, too, has expended them all.
Your total number of blows does not increase.  Your digging ability is the
better of that granted by either weapon.

Special shield bonuses:
     Most melee weapons fit comfortably in one hand, keeping your shield arm
free.  If you have a shield on your arm, you can automatically take advantage of
opportunities to bash, gain a significant amount of standard protection (shields
have a high base armour class), and sometimes even deflect non-magical missiles
or partially protect against shards.

Shield bashes:
     When fighting hand-to-hand, you will occasionally get in a shield bash if
you are wearing a shield on your arm.  The frequency of shield bashes depends on
dexterity, melee combat skill, and the level of monster you are fighting.
Characters with no magic realm get in more shield bashes, as will those who do
little damage in melee otherwise.  The effectiveness of shield bashes depends
mostly on shield size and weight, with a bonus for strength.  When you bash a
monster, you will inflict damage, and possibly stunning or even confusion.  You
may also stumble, and lose normal melee blows.

Two-handed weapons:
     Other weapons require two hands (but many of these can be wielded in one
hand by very strong players).  Any shield worn is transferred to your back.
This negates base armour protection and removes the special shield abilities
above, but has no effect on magical protection, resistances, or other
attributes.

Ranged fire inaccuracy:
     Distance from the target has a significant effect on the accuracy of ranged
fire and throwing.  You may need to get quite close to hit tough monsters,
especially if your skill is relatively low.

Special Notes:
     In order to attack a creature that you can't see in a wall or door, you
must issue the Tunnel or alter adjacent grid command.



====== Burglary ======

     All special burglary actions other than talents can be used by typing the
'+' (alter) key, and then moving towards a monster (to steal), a passable grid
(to set a trap), or a door (to lock it).  Burglars cannot use most of these
abilities when shapeshifted.

Stealing  (requires a skill of 4):
     Stealing is lucrative but risky.  All monsters that drop anything will have
at least some treasure on them.  Humans, humanoids, and dragons are the juiciest
targets, and most other smart bipedal creatures, nagas, or wraiths are fairly
well-off too; the higher the monster level, the larger the purse.  Uniques are
especially rich.  High-level monsters and other thieves are harder to steal
from, but sleeping monsters are easier.  But burglary is not all fun and games.
Every time you steal on a level, the monsters get warier.  Steal too often, and
you may very quickly get hunted down.

Locking doors  (requires a skill of 7):
     Burglars may lock closed doors; locking a door makes it more difficult for
monsters to open.  The power of the lock increases with skill.

Trap-setting  (requires a skill of 10):
     Of all the many things that only burglars can do, setting traps is the most
important.  Depending on your burglary skill, you may have between one and six
traps active at any one time.  It takes three turns to set up a trap (this is
normally automatic but, if disturbed, you'll have to issue the command a few
times).
     You then load the trap with one or more objects by typing '+', and moving
towards an existing monster trap.  Traps may be loaded with melee weapons,
missile weapons, potions, scrolls, wands, staffs, rods, or anything that can be
thrown.  You can only load the trap with one kind of object; the two exceptions
to this are that you need to supply a missile weapon with suitable ammunition,
and that you can pack in boulders to your heart's content.
     The damage traps do depends on your burglary skill and on the objects you
use.  A skilled burglar can make traps which use magical devices that he cannot
understand, wield weapons that he cannot lift, and fire missiles with deadly
accuracy regardless of combat skill.

Monsters and Traps:
     Whenever a monster enters the grid containing the trap, several things can
happen.  Firstly, ghosts and evasive monsters get a (large) chance to ignore the
trap entirely.  Secondly, smart monsters get a chance to disarm the trap, and
all non-ghostly monsters get a chance to smash it.  If the trap is neither
avoided nor destroyed, it goes off.
     A single non-perfectly balanced weapon will get melee blows, a missile
launcher will fire one or more shots, a potion will smash, a scroll will be
read, a charged wand, staff, or rod will activate, and anything else will be
thrown.  In essence, a trap is like getting a free chance to do damage without
being in harm's way.
     Most weapon attributes (Skill, Deadliness, multipliers, slays, brands, and
number of blows or shots, but not critical hits) are treated much they are in
normal combat.  The damage of most items other than scrolls and ordinary thrown
objects varies depending on burglary skill.

Light Weapons, Sneak Attacks, and Backstabs:
     Burglars are better with light weapons than anyone else.  With them, they
can get quite significant bonuses to combat Skill.  Conversely, their penalty
for heavy weapons goes up with skill until it is twice the normal amount.  Your
character screen display takes all of this into account.
     Burglars get extra bonuses to Skill against sleeping monsters in melee,
when shooting, and when using special throwing weapons.  If they go into
sneaking mode, and melee a sleeping monster, they may sometimes be able to land
sneak attacks, which act as unusually powerful critical hits.  Note:  You cannot
sneak-attack a monster, then use a wand of sleep monster on it, then sneak
attack it again.
     Burglars can also backstab fleeing opponents (this acts as a general
increase to hit chance).



====== Defence ======

Hitpoints:
     If your hitpoints drop below zero, you die.  Always have something to
quickly restore them.

Escaping:
     A trapped adventurer is a dead adventurer.  Always have a way to get out of
trouble.

Defending against pure damage:
     Your armour class (AC) reduces the chance that most kinds of melee attacks
(except gazing and stealing) will hit you.  It reduces the pure damage taken by
most melee attacks (acid, electricity, fire, frost, and poison attacks being the
exceptions), and makes it less likely that they will stun or cut you.  It also
protects against shots, arrows, bolts, boulders, missiles, and certain kinds of
traps, but not against magic.
      Each piece of armour has a base AC value and possibly also a magical
bonus, which will not be displayed unless the item has been identified.  Add the
two together, and you have the total protective value of the item.  For example,
a Chain Mail (-3) [14, +6] increases your AC by 20.  Note the "(-3)".  It is a
penalty to melee Skill; heavy armour restricts your movement slightly.
     Special note:  shields worn on the back have a base AC value of zero.

Cuts, poison, and stunning:
     Many monsters can inflict special kinds of physical damage on you, such as
opening wounds, and poisoning or stunning you.  After you start earning a little
money, plow some of it back into potions of cure wounds, and keep one or the
other handy at all times.  If a monster manages to heavily stun you, get away
fast!

Character-hindrance:
     There are many monsters capable of casting spells to blind, confuse, slow,
and paralyze you, plus quite a few other nasty tricks not mentioned here.  Free
Action eventually becomes critical to your survival, and you should keep stuff
that fixes blindness and confusion on hand.  Your Saving Throw protects against
these and other attacks.

Elemental and magical attacks:
     Acid, Electricity, Fire, and Cold are the basic elements, and many monsters
use them.  Because the maximum damage they can do to you is very high, becoming
resistant is important.  Unlike with other attack types, you can resist, double
resist, and be immune to the elements.  Double resistance is the combination of
a permanent resistance (from equipment) and a temporary one (from a spell).
Temporary resistances are also known as oppositions.  Immunity to any of the
elements is hard to get.
     Poison is deadly, and not so easy to gain resistance to.  You can double-
resist (resist and oppose) poison.
     There are many kinds of magical attacks; most can be resisted, some can
not.  Those capable of doing the most damage are darkness, chaos, and nether.

     For more detail, see the section on object attributes.

Reductions of Experience and Stats:
    Even when your character is starting out, there are rare traps and monsters
capable of lowering his stats and draining his exp.  In addition, a strong,
unresisted elemental attack can occasionally lower a stat.  Slowly, these
dangers increase until it becomes very important that you find objects that
provide hold life and sustain at least your critical stats.

Theft:
     Nobody is more annoying than a thief.  You've just found that cool
spellbook or nifty weapon, and now it's gone.  You can gain a significant degree
of protection from theft by increasing your dodging skill and your dexterity,
and can always collect your stuff from the thief's corpse.  Unfortunately,
thieves are smart enough to stash away the money they take from you.

Rumours:
     It is rumoured that certain undead possess a very deadly touch...
     The same rumours whisper that Athelas has remarkable curative properties...



====== Magic ======


--- The Four Realms of Magic ---

Wizardry:
     Wizardry is the magic of power:  the power of the elements, of chaos and
confusion, of nexus and planar travel, and of pure mana.  Wizards can bufuddle
their enemies, vanish into thin air, and wield all sorts of esoteric powers.
Wizardry can be tricky to use, however; miscast spells can unleash all sorts of
wild magic.

Piety:
     Piety is the channeling of divine force; those allied to Heaven have
extraordinary powers to heal and Judge.  They wield light against the darkness
of evil, the darkness of ignorance, the darkness of the hidden and unknown.  The
pious can dispel and banish, wield holy fire, and expose the very minds of their
enemies to the untrammeled might of God.
     Pious characters can only wield blunt (hafted) and blessed melee weapons
effectively.  If they chose to wield any other kind of weapon, they get a
penalty to melee skill, a reduced light radius, and their prayers are more
likely to fail.

Druidic Lore:
     Druids and druids alone understand the lore of nature; the earth, the sea,
and the sky are at their beck and call.  They wield the elements like no other
magic-user can, and alter the weather itself to enhance their powers.  Druids
may shapeshift into many marvelous forms, wither their foes, and have powers to
heal and recover second only to the pious.
     See the sections on weather and shapeshifting below.

Necromancy:
     Black hexes and red blood, foul rituals:  dread, terrible necromancy.
Users of the Dark Arts wield night, nether, life-draining and dispelling, pure
mana, poison, and mental powers to crush all who stand against them, and can
ritually enhance their powers to achieve horrific strength.  Great in power
although necromancy is, it can be very dangerous when cast incautiously.  A
necromancer is well advised to pay attention to his saving throw.
     See the section on shapeshifting below.


--- Spellcasting ---

Getting spell information:
     The magics of the major realms of magic are found in books, seven for each
realm.  Three are readily available in stores, the other four are harder to
find.
      You may browse books of your realm.  When browsing, you may get more
information about individual spells that are not too high-level by pressing
their letter.  Also, spells that you have cast at least once will always display
any power or damage information.  This information usually updates to reflect
temporary conditions (weather being the major exception), so you get up-to-date
information on the approximate current power of your spells.
     Be aware that the true usefulness of some spells only becomes apparent with
much experimentation.

Gaining new spells:
     You learn new spells by pressing 'G', choosing a spellbook with unlearnt
spells that are not too high level for you, and (unless you use holy magics)
choosing a spell.

Casting spells:
     You may cast any learnt spell that has a spell level less than or equal to
your Spellcasting skill.
     You cast spells by typing 'm' or 'p', choosing a spellbook, and then a
spell.  If you don't have enough mana to cast that spell, the failure chance is
increased, you may lose a point of constitution, and you may faint dead away
(especially if you didn't have nearly enough mana).  Having chosen a spell, you
then try to cast it.  Failing means that priests and druids just lose their turn
(and their mana), but wizards may unleash wild magic and necromancers get
attacked by the dark forces they failed to bind.

Getting good at magic:
     Again, only those who take a spellcaster's Oath can tap the full power of a
realm.  You take an Oath by selecting the special realm skill (Wizardry, Holy
Alliance, Nature Lore, or Blood Dominion) in the skills screen, and typing '*'.

Mana:
     Your mana depends on your magic power skill and your spell stat.  All
spellcasters lose a percentage (not a fixed amount) of mana for wearing heavy
armor; specialist spellcasters are most affected.  You can reduce this penalty
by increasing your dodging skill.  In addition, those using wizardry or
necromancy lose a chunk of mana if they wear gloves that do not provide free
action or increase magic mastery skill.  Messages will warn you whenever this
happens.

Spell failure chance:
     Your spell failure chance depends on the spell itself (some spells are
inherently hard to cast), the minimum skill required to cast the spell, and your
specialist magic-user skill.  Your specialist magic-user skill also has an
important effect on the reliability of many spells.


Weather:
     The knowledge of weather is an art, not a science.  However, it is believed
that values for wind, temperature, and humidity are generally near average with
only occasional extremes.  It is also rumoured that each of these three
components of weather affect two kinds of druidic magic; one benefits from low
values, another benefits from high ones.
     Druids have a talent that allows them to forcast the weather.  Weather
forecasting becomes more accurate with Perception skill, and less accurate as
you travel further below the surface.  At a depth of 5000' for example, you need
a perception skill of 60% to get perfectly accurate weather reports.

Shapeshifting:
     There are two kinds of shapechanges.  Druids (and necromancers) can take on
the form of various creatures for as long as they like.  Certain other magics
and elixirs can also change your shape, but their effects last only for a short
time.
     In all cases, you can return to your normal form by typing ']'.  You lose a
third of your mana whenever not in your normal form, and your magical device
skill usually drops, but you often gain some infravision.  Various effects can
be checked by using the Character screen.
  Goat    : Slow digestion, can eat almost anything safely.
  Bear    : Hard hitter, tough and strong.
  Mouse   : Weak, but incredibly stealthy.  Cannot aggravate.  Perceptive.
  Hound   : Telepathy.
  Cheetah : Fast and dexterous but not very strong.
  Lion    : No fear, excellent bare-clawed fighter.
  Dragon  : Good fighter, bonuses to various stats.  Can breath using essences.
  Ent     : Strong, wise, resist poison and cold, free action, see invis, great
            at tunneling.  Cannot have feather fall, cannot be immune to or
            resist fire, lousy dexterity.
  Troll   : Extreme regeneration and toughness.  Dumb.  No feather fall.
  Bat     : Fast but weak.  Infravision, feather fall, and resist blindness.


--- Spell projection types ---

     The names of spells and magical devices sometimes give you information
about what areas they affect, and what shapes they take.

"Bolt", "Missile":
     Fires a magical bolt in a direction or at your chosen target.  Are stopped
by the first monster or wall in their way.  Some also "Beam" upon occasion.

"Beam", "Spear", "Lance", "Line", "Spark"
     Fires a beam of magic in the direction you choose, or towards your target.
They are quite useful because they do full damage to every monster in a straight
line.  Wands and Rods of Light work this way.  A few beam spells ("spark") have
short ranges.

"Arc", "Cone", "Breath"
     Fires an arc, centered on the direction you choose or on a line towards
your target, and always originating at your location.  These are relatively
short-range spells, because arcs lose energy as they expand.  All monster
breaths are arcs.

"Ball", "Storm"  (storms have a larger radius)
     If you target a specific monster, such spells explode centered at that
location.  Otherwise, they travel in the direction you choose, and explode as
soon they hit a monster or wall, or reach their maximum range.  These spells
only do full damage to the single grid at the center of the explosion, but can
affect monsters that can't see you.

"Orb", "Sphere"
     Orbs are ball spells that do full damage to every grid they affect, and
usually have small explosions.

"Dispel", "Confuse/Slow/Frighten/etc. Monsters"
     A fair number of spells affect all monsters in line of sight (no walls,
rubble, or trees between you and them, up to a range of 20).

<<various>>
     Ball spells that center on you do full damage to all adjacent grids.  Ball
spells can take the form of starburst explosions; they do full damage to all
grids they affect, but are less likely to hit grids further away from the
center.
     There are also many different kinds of special projections, such as walls
of fire, beam storms, vortexes, lingering clouds, and so on.


--- Hindering your foes ---

     If it looks too tough to kill, perhaps you can knock it down a bit.  There
are few monsters that cannot be hindered in some way if you work hard enough at
it.

 Sleep:
     Sleeping monsters can't hurt you - until they wake up again.
 Slow:
     If you can slow a monster, you are well on the way to killing it.
     Slowed monsters eventually return to normal speed.
 Stun:
     Bashing, strong electrical attacks, and some other things can stun
     monsters, reducing their spellcasting and melee ability.
 Confuse:
     Monsters may be confused by bright light (blinding), confusion attacks,
     or spells of confuse monster.  They move randomly about and cannot cast
     any spells until the effects wear off.
 Fear:
     Most monsters can be frightened.  Those that are will attempt to teleport
     away (if they have such a spell) or run.  Monsters slower than you will
     charge and go down fighting if nearby.
 Mana:
     Wait for the monster to run out of mana:  Most monsters have a limited
     amount of mana.  It may take a long time for them to run out, but once
     they do, they'll need a while to recover.  Be aware that some monsters
     can magically recover mana.


--- Magical Devices ---

     Wands, staffs, and rods are an important part of many adventurers'
arsenals, and some specialize in their use.  In addition to these items, certain
rare rings can be 'A'ctivated and there are rumours of armors and artifacts that
can unleash enormous destruction.
     If you depend on magical devices much, it is important to have a high
enough magical device skill.  This applies especially to magical devices that
hinder monsters.

Getting exact damage information:
     If you use magical devices often enough, you will eventually get the
message "you feel you know more about...".  'I'nspect the object, and you may
very well see extra numerical information about damage, etc.  This takes a lot
of the guesswork out of using staffs, wands, and rods to kill your foes.

Recharging:
     Wands and staffs have to be recharged every so often.  The failure rate of
recharging depends on item type (wands are more fragile than staffs), item
level, your magical device skill, and the power of the recharging spell you are
using.  A high magical device skill makes magical recharging much safer.




================ Saving, Loading, Winning, Cheating, and Dying ================


     Saving and loading your character should be easy.  So, sadly, is getting
him killed.  Winning is a little harder, but the novice player can take
advantage of various cheats to improve his chances down in the dungeon.


--- Saving your Game ---

     Saving your game is usually easy.  You can use the save game command, or
(on some systems) a menu option.  If you cannot save your game, you probably
have one of two problems:
1) The folder "<<game>>/lib/save" does not exist.  Create this directory and
   any others that are missing (see the list of files elsewhere in the docs).
2) You are using a multi-user machine and do not have write permission to
   that file or directory.


--- Loading your Game ---

DOS, UNIX:
     The game will automatically look for savefiles in the "lib/save" directory.
1) It will try to load any file that you specify with the "-u" command line
   option.
2) It will try to load the first file specified in "lib/save/global.svg", but
   only if that character is alive.
3) It will try to load any file named "PLAYER" (capitalization may or may not be
   ignored).

     If none of these things work, the game will display a savefile management
menu, allowing you to choose files listed in "global.svg", type in another
filename, or start a new character.
     On these systems, savefiles do not change names if you change the character
name.

Macintosh, Windows:
     In addition to using the methods above, you can also choose the menu option
"load savefile", which allows you to load savefiles from almost any directory.
With suitable use of option files, the Macintosh can also save to almost any
directory.
     On these system, savefiles may change names if you change the character
name.

Loading dead characters:
     If you load a dead character, the game will flash a message telling you
that it is using the slain adventurer's monster memory.  You then create a new
character.

Savefile compatibility report:
     Sangband loads files from Sangband 1.0.0+.


--- Winning The Game ---

     Once your character has killed Sauron, who lives on level 99 (4950') in the
dungeon, a magical staircase will appear that will allow you to finally reach
level 100.  Morgoth lurks on this level of the dungeon, and you will not be able
to go below his level until you have killed him.  Try to avoid wandering around
on level 100 unless you are ready for him, since he has a habit of coming at you
across the dungeon, the Mighty Hammer 'Grond' in hand, to slay you for your
impudence.

     Morgoth cannot be killed by some of the easier methods used on normal
creatures.  Morgoth, like all other "Unique" monsters, will simply teleport away
to another region of the level if you attempt to use a spell such as destruction
upon him.  Morgoth, like some other monsters, cannot be polymorphed, slept,
charmed, or genocided.  Magical spells like Mana Storm and Annihilation are
effective against him, as are some of the more powerful weapons, but he is
difficult to kill and if allowed to escape for a time will heal himself rapidly.

     If you should actually survive the attempt of killing Morgoth, you will
receive the status of WINNER.  You may continue to explore, and may even save
the game and play more later, but since you have defeated the toughest creature
alive, there is really not much point.  Unless you wish to listen to the rumors
of a powerful ring buried somewhere in the dungeon...

     When you are ready to retire, simply "commit suicide" (using the "Q" key)
to have your character entered into the high score list as a winner.  Note that
until you retire, you can still be killed, so you may want to retire before
wandering into a room with 95 Power Dragons crammed inside...


--- Upon Death and Dying ---

     If your character's hit points fall below zero, he dies.  The dreaded
tombstone will appear, and you may check out his attributes and possessions one
last time.

     Your character will leave behind a reduced save file, which contains only
the monster memory and your option choices, both of which new characters may
use.  It is very helpful to know something about the monster that slew your
ancestor!


--- Cheating Death ---

     One of the most important things about this game is that your character's
life is so important.  Let him die, and you start over from scratch.  This is
one of the secrets to this game's fascination; anyone who cheats death is really
not getting the full experience, and any Morgoth-slayers yanked from the jaws of
death are not full winners.  But what if your characters seem to die all the
time (like mine!), and you really want to keep playing with the same guy?  Well,
the game has a few answers for that too.  You may cheat death by:

- Toggling on the "cheat death" option (see the help file "optdesc.txt").  This
keeps your character ticking, and is even kind enough to give you a running
tally of your deaths by setting the character's age to zero when first used, and
increasing it by one each time thereafter.  Trying to keep this number low is a
great way to learn the game.
- Making backup savefiles.
- Aborting the game just as the tombstone appears or before.




================================= Appendices ==================================


====== Object Attributes ======


     All combat methods other than Karate and Wrestling require equipment, and
all benefit greatly from various qualities that your equipped items may possess.
Defence is similarly equipment-dependent.


--- Ordinary Attributes ---

Example 1:  A Glaive (3d4) (+6, +4) [8, +0]

Bonus to Skill:
     The glaive above increases melee Skill by 6.  This bonus improves your
chance to strike a monster and the number and quality of critical hits.  Apart
from rare gloves, armours seldom have bonuses to Skill.  Some have small
penalties.

Bonus to Deadliness:
     The glaive above increases melee Deadliness by 4.  This increases the
damage of every blow you land.  Apart from rare gloves, armours seldom have
bonuses to Deadliness.

Bonus to Base Armour Class:
     All armours have bonuses to base armour class.  Glaives and some other
weapons have bonuses to base armour class, usually because they help keep
monsters further away from you, or parry blows.  The example above increases
this value by 8.
     When wielding a weapon, your armour class can increase by up to five times
its base value, depending on your skill.

Bonus, Plus to Armour Class:
     Armour of unusually good quality or that is magical also increases your
plus to armour class.  This adds to your total protection value.  Only rare
weapons do the same.


--- Adjustments to Vital statistics and Abilities ---

Stat Bonuses:
     Any kind of wearable item may affect one or more stats.  See the help file
"abilattr.txt" to find out more about what altering a stat does.

Sustain Stats:
     Any kind of wearable item may sustain one or more stats.  This ensures that
the attacks of your foes never lower that stat.

Stealth:
     Certain cloaks, boots, and (more rarely) other items lessen the amount of
noise you make when moving around the dungeon.  This is very handy for avoiding
fights and getting in the first hit.  Stealth also reduces the noise you make in
combat, but the effect is less noticeable.

Awareness:
     Some rings, headgear, and various other items improve your chances to
reveal secret doors and find traps before they find you, allow you to "hear"
unseen monsters near to you, and make it somewhat more likely that you will
successfully pseudo-ID objects.

Infravision:
     Some headgear and (more rarely) other items increase the range at which you
can see warm-blooded creatures, even those that would otherwise be invisible.

Tunneling:
     Some gloves and weapons allow you to dig through rock more effectively.
All special digging tools have a bonus to tunneling.

Speed:
     Boots, rings, and weapons that hasten you are rare and powerful, for a fast
player can perform several actions in the time it used to take to do just one.
Players moving at speed -10 are half as fast as normal, at +10 are twice as fast
as normal, and at +20 are three times as fast as normal.  The maximum useful
speed is (roughly) +40.

Invisibility:
     You can become partially invisible; the greater your invisibility rating,
the more likely it is that most monsters will move about randomly instead of
attacking you.  This is true especially if you stay quiet and don't get too near
to them.

Disarming:
     Increases your ability to disarm traps and chests and unlock doors.

Magic Mastery:
     Certain amulets and gloves improve your skills with magical devices and
activatable items.

Save:
     Increases your saving throw.

Mana:
     Increases your mana.

Light Radius:
     Pushes your light radius outwards.  Only the best light radius applies.


--- Weapon Attributes ---

Damage bonuses  (only the best applies):
 Slay Evil     :  +10 against evil
 Slay Animal   :  +10 against animals    (weapons of Slaughter Animal get +15)
 Slay Orc      :  +10 against orcs and orc-like creatures
 Slay Troll    :  +18 against trolls
 Slay Giant    :  +18 against giants
 Slay Undead   :  +18 against undead     (weapons of Dispel Undead get +27)
 Slay Demon    :  +18 against demons     (weapons of Smite Demon get +27)
 Slay Dragon   :  +18 against dragons

 Brand Acid    :  +10 against everything not resistant to acid
 Brand Elec    :  +14 against everything not resistant to electricity
 Brand Fire    :  +14 against everything not resistant to fire
 Brand Cold    :  +14 against everything not resistant to cold
 Brand Pois    :  +14 against everything not resistant to poison

 Impact        :  +14 against rocky creatures

 Kill Dragon   :  +27 against dragons  (rare)
 Brand Flame   :  +22 against everything not resistant to fire  (rare)
 Brand Venom   :  +22 against everything not resistant to poison  (rare)

Blows:
     Gives you extra melee blows.

Extra Shots:
     Rare missile launchers may allow the player to shoot more quickly than
normal.  Each shot takes a fraction of a turn, making your target appear to move
in slow motion.  Some classes get innate extra shots.
     The amount of time you take to fire a shot is 200 / shots.  The value for
shots is usually 2, so a shot normally takes 100 energy (one turn).

Extra Might:
     Rare missile launchers have a greater than normal missile damage
multiplier.  For example: a "Sling of Extra Might (x3)" multiplies damage, not
by two like lesser slings, but by three.  The true missile weapon multiplier is
never known for sure until the object is identified.

Throwing:
     A number of weapons can be thrown effectively; you can determine which ones
by 'I'nspecting them.  Such weapons get various bonuses when thrown, but
eventually break if used in melee.

Perfect Balance:
     Some weapons can be thrown with unusual force, adding 50% to the amount of
damage done (before any slay/brand bonuses) should it hit.

Vorpal:
     Vorpal weapons get lots of critical hits, and reduce the effect of monster
resistances.

Blessed:
     Blessed weapons may be used by pious characters without penalty.

Impact:
     Weapons of impact do +14 damage to rocky creatures and will often force
opponents back.

Two-handed Wield Required:
     Glaives, Halberds, Quarterstaff, and all digging tools require two hands to
wield.

Two-handed Wield Desired:
     A fair number of large, powerful weapons must be wielded in two hands
unless the player has amazing strength (normally around 18/130 - 18/160,
depending on weapon weight).


--- Immunities ---

     If you should ever be fortunate enough to find a piece of equipment that
grants immunity to an element, you will take no damage from that element.  Be
warned that immunity does not extend to your backpack; the stuff you are
carrying in inventory can still be destroyed on rare occasions.

Immunity to Acid:
     You take no damage from acid.  Worn items will not be affected by acid.
Staffs, missiles, weapons, armour, and scrolls in your backpack become highly
resistant to destruction.

Immunity to Electricity:
     You take no damage from electricity.  Rings, wands, and rods in your
backpack become highly resistant to destruction.

Immunity to Cold:
     You take no damage from cold.  Potions in your backpack become highly
resistant to destruction.

Immunity to Fire:
     You take no damage from fire.  Spellbooks, scrolls, staffs, and burnable
weapons, missiles, and armour in your backpack become highly resistant to
destruction.


--- Resistances ---

     Resistances from equipment cannot be combined; You either have it or you
don't.

Resist Acid:
     You take one-thirds damage from acid.  Staffs, missiles, weapons, armour,
and scrolls in your backpack become a little more resistant to destruction.
Your equipment is attacked by acid half as often.

Resist Electricity:
     You take one-thirds damage from electricity.  Rings, wands, and rods in
your backpack become a little more resistant to destruction.

Resist Cold:
     You take one thirds damage from cold.  Potions in your backpack become a
little more resistant to destruction.

Resist Fire:
     You take one-thirds damage from fire.  Spellbooks, scrolls, staffs, and
burnable weapons, missiles, and armour in your backpack become a little more
resistant to destruction.

Resist Poison:
     You take one thirds damage from poison.

Resist Light:
     The damage you take from light is reduced.  You cannot be blinded by bright
light.

Resist Darkness:
     The damage you take from darkness is reduced.  You cannot be blinded by
darkness.

Resist Sound:
     The damage you take from sound is reduced.  You cannot be stunned by sound
or by a few other kinds of distance attacks.

Resist Shards:
     The damage you take from blasts of shards is reduced.  You cannot be cut by
shards.

Resist Nexus:
     The damage you take from nexus attacks is reduced.  You cannot be randomly
teleported by nexus, and will sometimes resist being warped around by gravity.

Resist Nether:
     The damage you take from nether is reduced.  You cannot lose experience to
nether.

Resist Chaos:
     The damage you take from chaos is reduced, and you are immune to all the
nasty things chaos can do to you.  This resistance does not make you resistant
to confusion.

Resist Disenchantment:
     Rarest of all the resistances, this reduces damage from disenchantment
attacks and renders your equipment immune to disenchantment.


--- Survival Attributes ---

Resist Fear:
     Renders you fearless.

Resist Blindness:
     Protects you from being blinded.

Resist Confusion:
     Makes you incapable of being confused.  Also reduces damage from blasts of
confusion.


--- Character Qualities ---

Slow Digestion:
     Reduces your need to consume food.

Feather Fall:
     Renders pit traps and trap doors harmless, makes walking on lava a bit less
dangerous, and reduces some effects of gravity and wind attacks.

Light:
     Some weapons and helms shine with inner light.  Wearing any number of such
objects will increase your illumination radius by one.

Regeneration:
     Players who regenerate recover hitpoints twice as quickly as normal, and
mana 3/2rds as quickly.  They also need to eat more.

Telepathy (ESP):
     It is not easy to acquire this, but players who do can see smart monsters
nearby.  Stupid monsters never appear, and "kind of smart" monsters only appear
occasionally.

See Invisible:
     Allows you to see and target monsters invisible to ordinary sight.

Free Action:
     Protects you from paralyzation and most slowing attacks.  Because
paralyzation can instantly kill you, keep an eye out for this important survival
aid.

Hold Life:
     Offers a high degree of protection from attacks (but not items) that lower
skills.

No Fuel:
     Some light sources require no fuel.


--- Curses and other Nastiness ---

Soulsteal:
     Some weapons need to be fed with the blood of your foes.  If they hunger,
and you do not feed them, they will eat at your lifeforce.

No Magic:
     A few objects are so unmagical that you cannot cast spells while using
them.

Random Teleportation:
     Some foul rings, amulets, and boots randomly take control of your movement
and whisk you around the dungeon.

Aggravate:
     Aggravation effectively reduces your stealth to nil, immediately waking up
all monsters nearby.  Some rings and amulets possess curses that aggravate, and
some weapons and armours are so powerful that no creature can ignore them.

Drain Exp:
     Objects that drain experience are perilous, because they slowly but surely
erase your accumulated memories.  Of course, you can keep killing monsters to
replace the experience which you lose.

Light (Normal) Curse:
     Many objects have light curses.  If you should wear or wield one, read a
scroll of remove curse.

Heavy Curse:
     The curses on some objects are less easy to remove.  If a ordinary scroll
of Remove Cure fails, find and read one of *Remove Curse*.

Permanent Curse:
     There is a great and terrible Ring, seen by perhaps one character in a
thousand, that can never be removed once put on.

====== Description, History, and Copyrights ======


--- The History of Sangband ---

     Skills Angband, or Sangband for short, is the oldest variant of Angband
still active; many long-time players remember it with great fondness.  It was
among the first roguelikes anywhere to introduce skills, shapechanges, fully-
fledged natural and necromantic realms, and special character talents.  Whole
webpages have been devoted to its features, and many a game developer has been
influenced by them.

     Sangband grew out of Chris Petit's interest in developing a version of
Angband with a skills system rather than character classes.  It was first
released March the 3rd, 1994, using the Angband 2.5.x codebase as modified in
Bangband (another of his variants).  When Chris Petit graduated a few months
later, development stopped for about a year at version 0.8.5.
     After that, Michael Gorse took over the project, re-releasing version
0.8.5, then taking the game up to 0.9.3 between 1995 and 1997.
     Julian Lighton happened to stumble across Sangband, and (aided by Greg
Wooledge) found himself fixing bugs as he found them.  First he made them
available on a website, then decided he had too much free time and took over
Sangband officially, releasing 0.9.4 in 1997 and 0.9.5 in 1998.  His work sorted
out the major game bugs and updated the code to Angband 2.8.3.
     In 2001, he passed the maintainership to Leon Marrick, who had played
Sangband almost since the beginning and modeled parts of his own variant on it.
     (The history of LM's maintainership will be written by someone else.)

the Official Angband Home Page ("http://thangorodrim.angband.org") for the most
up to date information about Angband.

Angband has an incredibly complex history, and is the result of a lot of work by
a lot of people, all of whom have contributed their time and energy for free,
rewarded only by the pleasure of keeping alive one of the best freeware games
available anywhere.

The version control files, if they existed, would span more than ten years time,
and more than six different primary developers.  Without such files, we must
rely on simpler methods, such as change logs, source file diffs, and word of
mouth.  Some of this information is summarized in this file.

Please be sure to read the copyright information at the end of this file.


Brief Version History:

First came "VMS Moria", by Robert Alan Koeneke (1985).

Then came "Umoria" (UNIX Moria), by James E. Wilson (1989).

Details about the history of the various flavors of "moria", the direct ancestor
to Angband, can be found elsewhere, and a note from Robert Alan Koeneke is
included in this file.  Note that "moria" has been ported to a variety of
platforms, and has its own newsgroup, and its own fans.

In 1990, Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand, with the help of other students at the
University of Warwick, created Angband 1.0, based on the existing code for
Umoria 5.2.1.  They wanted to expand the game, keeping or even strengthening the
grounding in Tolkien lore, while adding more monsters and items, including
unique monsters and artifact items, plus activation, pseudo-sensing, level
feelings, and special dungeon rooms.

Over time, Sean Marsh, Geoff Hill, Charles Teague, and others worked on the
source, releasing a copy known as "Angband 2.4.frog_knows" at some point, which
ran only on Unix systems, but which was ported by various people to various
other systems.  One of the most significant ports was the "PC Angband 1.4" port,
for old DOS machines, which added color and various other significant changes,
only some of which ever made it back into the official source.

Then Charles Swiger (cs4w+@andrew.cmu.edu) took over, sometime in late 1993,
cleaning up the code, fixing a lot of bugs, and bringing together various
patches from various people, resulting in several versions of Angband, starting
with Angband 2.5.1 (?), and leading up to the release of Angband 2.6.1 (and
Angband 2.6.2) in late 1994.  Some of the changes during this period were based
on suggestions from the "net", and from various related games, including "UMoria
5.5", "PC Angband 1.4", and "FAngband".

Angband 2.6.1 was primarily targetted towards Unix/NeXT machines, and it
required the use of the low level "curses" commands for all screen manipulation
and keypress interaction.  Each release had to be ported from scratch to any new
platforms, normally by creating visual display code that acted as a "curses"
emulator.  One such port was "Macintosh Angband 2.6.1", by Keith Randall, which
added support for color, and which formed the basis for the first release of
Angband 2.7.0.

In late 1994, Charles Swiger announced that he was starting a real job and would
no longer be able to be the Angband maintainer.  This induced some amount of
uproar in the Angband community (as represented by the Angband newsgroup), with
various people attempting to form "committees" to take over the maintenance of
Angband.  Since committees have never given us anything but trouble (think
"COBOL"), there was very little resistance when, on the first day of 1995, Ben
Harrison made his code available, calling it "Angband 2.7.0", and by default,
taking over as the new maintainer of Angband.

Between then and 1999, Ben Harrison transformed Angband, becoming (in many
people's minds) the most important contributor to the game since Robert Koeneke.
The first and most important change he made was a massive code-level cleanup.
This, combined with the development of a generic, OS-independant interface,
allowed simple porting to many new and existing platforms (including X11, IBM
machines, OS2, Windows, Amiga, and Linux), and made possible the explosion of
variants that adds such vigor to the game today.

Major changes made in this period include: .

- macros and keymaps
- user preference files
- user-customizable template files for monsters, objects, ego-items,
  artifacts, vaults, and terrain features.
- more powerful and efficient line of sight, lighting, grid refresh,
  and spell projection code
- better string-handling
- new or rewritten inventory and equipment management, monster processing,
  object creation and effects, and a whole lot more.

After the release of Angband 2.8.3 Ben's free time was more and more occupied by
his work.  He released a beta version of Angband 2.8.5, introducing many new
features, but couldn't give as much attention to maintaining the game as he
wanted to.

So in March 2000, Robert Ruehlmann offered to take over Angband and started to
fix the remaining bugs in the Angband 2.8.5 beta.  The resulting version was to
be released as Angband 2.9.0.  Further bugfixes and a couple of new features -
including many in the realms of user-customizability, with greater control over
ego-items, player races and classes, monsters, items and artifacts - have led to
the current version.

=== A Posting from the Original Author ===

From: koeneke@ionet.net (Robert Alan Koeneke) Newsgroups:
rec.games.roguelike.angband,rec.games.roguelike.moria Subject: Early history of
Moria Date: Wed, 21 Feb 1996 04:20:51 GMT

I had some email show up asking about the origin of Moria, and its relation to
Rogue.  So I thought I would just post some text on the early days of Moria.

First of all, yes, I really am the Robert Koeneke who wrote the first Moria.  I
had a lot of mail accussing me of pulling their leg and such.  I just recently
connected to Internet (yes, I work for a company in the dark ages where Internet
is concerned) and was real surprised to find Moria in the news groups...
Angband was an even bigger surprise, since I have never seen it.  I probably
spoke to its originator though...  I have given permission to lots of people
through the years to enhance, modify, or whatever as long as they freely
distributed the results.  I have always been a proponent of sharing games, not
selling them.

Anyway...

Around 1980 or 81 I was enrolled in engineering courses at the University of
Oklahoma.  The engineering lab ran on a PDP 1170 under an early version of UNIX.
I was always good at computers, so it was natural for me to get to know the
system administrators.  They invited me one night to stay and play some games,
an early startrek game, The Colossal Cave Adventure (later just 'Adventure'),
and late one night, a new dungeon game called 'Rogue'.

So yes, I was exposed to Rogue before Moria was even a gleam in my eye.  In
fact, Rogue was directly responsible for millions of hours of play time wasted
on Moria and its descendents...

Soon after playing Rogue (and man, was I HOOKED), I got a job in a different
department as a student assistant in computers.  I worked on one of the early
VAX 11/780's running VMS, and no games were available for it at that time.  The
engineering lab got a real geek of an administrator who thought the only purpose
of a computer was WORK! Imagine...  Soooo, no more games, and no more rogue!

This was intolerable!  So I decided to write my own rogue game, Moria Beta 1.0.
I had three languages available on my VMS system.  Fortran IV, PASCAL V1.?, and
BASIC.  Since most of the game was string manipulation, I wrote the first
attempt at Moria in VMS BASIC, and it looked a LOT like Rogue, at least what I
could remember of it.  Then I began getting ideas of how to improve it, how it
should work differently, and I pretty much didn't touch it for about a year.

Around 1983, two things happened that caused Moria to be born in its
recognizable form.  I was engaged to be married, and the only cure for THAT is
to work so hard you can't think about it; and I was enrolled for fall to take an
operating systems class in PASCAL.

So, I investigated the new version of VMS PASCAL and found out it had a new
feature.  Variable length strings!  Wow...

That summer I finished Moria 1.0 in VMS PASCAL.  I learned more about data
structures, optimization, and just plain programming that summer then in all of
my years in school.  I soon drew a crowd of devoted Moria players...  All at OU.

I asked Jimmey Todd, a good friend of mine, to write a better character
generator for the game, and so the skills and history were born.  Jimmey helped
out on many of the functions in the game as well.  This would have been about
Moria 2.0

In the following two years, I listened a lot to my players and kept making
enhancements to the game to fix problems, to challenge them, and to keep them
going.  If anyone managed to win, I immediately found out how, and 'enhanced'
the game to make it harder.  I once vowed it was 'unbeatable', and a week later
a friend of mine beat it!  His character, 'Iggy', was placed into the game as
'The Evil Iggy', and immortalized...  And of course, I went in and plugged up
the trick he used to win...

Around 1985 I started sending out source to other universities.  Just before a
OU / Texas football clash, I was asked to send a copy to the Univeristy of
Texas...  I couldn't resist...  I modified it so that the begger on the town
level was 'An OU football fan' and they moved at maximum rate.  They also
multiplied at maximum rate...  So the first step you took and woke one up, it
crossed the floor increasing to hundreds of them and pounded you into
oblivion...  I soon received a call and provided instructions on how to 'de-
enhance' the game!

Around 1986 - 87 I released Moria 4.7, my last official release.  I was working
on a Moria 5.0 when I left OU to go to work for American Airlines (and yes, I
still work there).  Moria 5.0 was a complete rewrite, and contained many neat
enhancements, features, you name it.  It had water, streams, lakes, pools, with
water monsters.  It had 'mysterious orbs' which could be carried like torches
for light but also gave off magical aura's (like protection from fire, or
aggrivate monster...).  It had new weapons and treasures...  I left it with the
student assistants at OU to be finished, but I guess it soon died on the vine.
As far as I know, that source was lost...

I gave permission to anyone who asked to work on the game.  Several people asked
if they could convert it to 'C', and I said fine as long as a complete credit
history was maintained, and that it could NEVER be sold, only given.  So I guess
one or more of them succeeded in their efforts to rewrite it in 'C'.

I have since received thousands of letters from all over the world from players
telling about their exploits, and from administrators cursing the day I was
born...  I received mail from behind the iron curtain (while it was still
standing) talking about the game on VAX's (which supposedly couldn't be there
due to export laws).  I used to have a map with pins for every letter I
received, but I gave up on that!

I am very happy to learn my creation keeps on going...  I plan to download it
and Angband and play them...  Maybe something has been added that will surprise
me!  That would be nice...  I never got to play Moria and be surprised...
