Character Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed races for both player and shopkeepers
Changed class names to Barbarian, Sorceress, Druid, Assasin, Amazon and
Paladin, added Necromancer class
Sex depends on class, not shown
Removed class titles

Changed starting equipment, no gold at birth, all characters get 4 cure lights
wounds, 1 identify, and 1 word of recall, amazons get arrows, and all starting
equipment is 99% off

Removed auto-roller, point-based, and maximize options - all attributes have a
natural max of 18/100

Charaters need twice as much XP to advance, classes do not differ in XP
penalty, and XP penalty is no longer shown

Attributes, HP, Mana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attributes, hp and mana are set by class and no longer random
HP and Mana get a base value from class, and increase a set amount as level and
the relevent stat increases (Con for hp, Int or Wis for mana)
Can now increase (practice) attributes with 'p', gets 1 stat point per level
after level 1
Changed how stat gains work - before 18/01, one point is gained at a time,
after 18, 1d10 points are gained at a time
Doubled the rarity of stat potions

Resting no longer regenerates hp unless player has regeneration
intrinstic. mana regenerates but very slowly (sorceress' warmth skill increases
mana regen)
Resting is randomly interrupted 1 in 5000 times, as it is not so effective now
and so uses up more food and light fuel
HP and mana are restored when gaining a level

Information
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a command to show the time of day (control-T)

Put info on used stat points where race bonus was
Added XP, mana and health bars
Added display of remaining stat/skill points to main screen
If below level 50, show XP needed to advance to next level

Items are always psuedo-id'd, average items are always identified, changed good
to magic (weapons with only damage dice changed (due to a damage bonus/penalty)
are average), excellent to rare and special to unique

Show no information about unidentified weapons and armour, and show only
information about weapons/equipment that differs from the norm, ie base AC for
armour, damage dice for weapons, pval for diggers and multiplier for bows

Changed format of melee weapons and missiles from (2d5) (+5, +5) to (+5, 2d5+5)
Show extra might in multiplier of missile launcher

Rods show how many more turns are left till they can be used again
Inform player when rods and artifacts recharge, update charging rods/artifacts
in inven windows
Items show what percentile resistance they give, the value of skill bonuses,
and the exact chance of acticvating/using them (calculation is from
sCthangband)

Show both hands in character information display
Druid's unarmed blows are divided between hands for prettiness

Monster memory calculates average damage from both weapons
In monster memory, changed 'it has a liferating of x' to 'it takes an average
of x blows and y shots to kill' (based on known weapon damage, but not brands
or slays)
Also added colored info to monster memory

Elements
~~~~~~~~
Added percentile resistances for electricity, fire, cold and poison. Max from
items is 75% and max from items + temporary resistance (bonus of 33%) is
90%. Items that granted immunity now grant a +100% bonus.
Non-artifacts get randomized resistances

Cold now slows the target, player can resist the effects with cold resistance,
monsters immune to cold are not affected

Removed all instances of acid resistance, acid brand, etc. Acid traps do a
small amount of physical damage

Skills
~~~~~~
Removed spellcasting and spell books
All classes get mana, only sorceress is encumbered by gloves, barbarian and
paladin are not encumbered by heavy equipment

Can now study skills with 'G', gets 1 skill point at level 1 and 2 skill points
per level after that
Enabled looking at skills for next level with 'G' even if no skills points
exist

Skills may require a certain XP level, or other skills, before they can be
learnt
Cannot advance a skill past a skill level of current XP level + 1 - level
required to first study the skill. So you can max a level 1 skill at XP level
20, but you have to wait till XP level 49 to max a skill that requires level 30
Cannot advance a skill past skill level 20

Can use non-passive skills with 'm' - these can cost mana and take time to use

Added auras - can be activated and deactivated by selecting them from skill
list. An aura may have a mana cost and duration (but character can choose to
end it before the aura times out), or a mana cost per turn (and it ends when
the character does not have enough mana left to continue it), or a mana cost
each time it affects a monster, or no cost at all. Only one aura can be active
at any time, and selecting a different aura ends the current aura
Changing auras does not take any time

Added shapeshifts - cost mana to activate, end after a certain period of time,
cannot be deactivated except by choosing a different shapeshift
While active, grant various bonuses
Lycanthropy skill grants a druid more hp while shapeshifted, and extends the
duration of the shapeshift
Added druid skills which require a certain form to be known before they can be
learnt, and the form to be worn before they can be used

Active auras and shapeshifts are shown on main screen

Added charge-up skills and finishing moves for assasins
Attacking with a charge-up skill active adds bouses and different effects to
finishing moves, but costs mana, and stops when the character has accumulated 3
'charges' (the maximum) of the type which the skill provides. Studying a
charge-up skill increases the chance that the character can hold on to these
'charges' for longer, as well as increasing their effect on finishing moves.
Changing charge-up skills does not take any time.
Finishing moves are attack skills available to the assasin, which have various
effects and also benefit from charge-up skills. Attacking normally with no
charge-up skills active counts as a finishing move.
Added display of current charges above health and mana bars

-If studying-                   -If using-                         -Color-
and skill is maxed                                                 light red
                                an active aura or shapeshift       light green
and skill can be studied        and skill is useable               white
and not high enough XP level                                       dark red
and pre-requisites are not met  and mana/requirements not met      dark red

When studying skills, information shown is for the next skill level up rather
than the current level, unless the skill is at level 20 and cannot be increased
further
Don't always show information about skill's effectiveness, but do show reason
for not being able to study or use a skill

Equipment
~~~~~~~~~
Cannot equip unidentified items

Added Quiver slot

Added two weapon combat - assasins can wield two claw type weapons at a time,
barbarians can wield two non-claw weapons at a time. Blows (but not extra
attacks, which only affect enchanted weapon) are divided between hands
Cannot wield a non-ok weapon if an ok weapon is in second slot
When wielding an ok weapon with one already wielded, can choose whether to dual
wield, if yes, then second weapon replaces shield (if any), if no then swap
weapons normally

Added two-handed weapons, cannot wield if already wielding something in shield
slot, cannot wear shield if wielding a two-handed weapon
Includes weapons heavier than 20lbs, and also Mage Staff, Quarterstaff, Beaked
Axe, Glaive, Halberd, Awl-Pike, Pike

Inventory
~~~~~~~~~
Limited size of stacks of items - junk items, spikes and ammo remain at 99,
potions, scrolls, amulets, rings, flasks, and food except rations and waybread
to 20, empty bottles, rations, waybread and torches to 10, and nothing else can
stack

Objects
~~~~~~~
Got rid of lots of potions, scrolls, and magical devices
Added some new flavours from Sangband

Added new items, added them to randart code, added effects of timed telepathy,
protection from undead, detect undead, detect animals
Added ego-items for rings/amulets, (Glowing) or (Indestructible)
Got rid of slay/kill/hurt orc/troll/giant/dragon ego-items
Added skill items - grants a bonus to one or more skills, does not affect
studying of skills

Added attr:char pairs to graf-bim.prf, graf-new.prf, graf-xxx.prf,
probably not 100% excatly what is in k_info.txt...
Skeletons (the items) now appear as 's' instead of '~'

Added TV_AXE, increased max tvals of ego-items to 4
Added TV_CLAW, claw weapons for assasins, can be dual-wielded by assasins
without penalty

Changed how damage bonus affects weapons and ammo - it now adjusts the number
of sides of each dice. A weapon with 1d5 + 3 which did an average of *2 damage
previously now does 1d10 damage.
Bows no longer get a damage bonus/penalty.
Around 1/4 weapons have no to-hit adjustment, but double the damage adjustment.

Increased rarity and value of regeneration on ego-items and randarts
Added restore light/serious/critical mana potions
Changed effect of healing items and mana potions - now they cure gradually over
time, amount to be cured shown in gray *'s in health/mana bars (heroism,
berserk strength, restore mana and rejuvenation potions still take effect
instantly)

Potions of life will now restore stats before healing to provide full health
even if CON was drained

Identify does *identify*, no more *identify* scrolls

Combat
~~~~~~
Attacking stops when monster dies (ie if not all available blows were used)
and only takes time for each blow that was actually used

Changed message when attacking monsters to 'you punch it' if no weapon is
wielded, druids using unarmed combat get 'you kick it' half the time

Druids using unarmed combat get a small bonus from wolf/bear claws unless
wearing gloves, and a small bonus from gauntlets or spiked/metal-shod boots (to
all blows, irrelevant of whether message is 'you punch' or 'you kick')

Stores
~~~~~~
Fade out price of items in stores if they're not affordable
Removed discounts

Rearranged items in stores
In addition to their normal inventory, stores stock a range of random items
whose depth depends on recall depth

Changed Alchemist to Gambling Den
Gambling Den generates unknown, random items whenever entered. Cost depends on
max recall depth, there are no discounts. Only ammunition comes in large
piles. Items must be bought as a pile (no buying just one to ID the rest), are
identified when purchase is complete

Quality of items in Black Market depends on recall depth

Examining an item in the home displayed the item as if it was identified, even
if it wasn't

Dungeon generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dungeon size is smaller at shallower depths (idea from Randomband)

Divided monsters into acts 1-5 (town monsters are act 0) and created themed
dungeon levels, that hold only monsters of the relevant act
Show the act when entering the dungeon level

Boring dungeons - no nests/pits/vaults/inner-rooms/cross-shaped-rooms

Monsters
~~~~~~~~
Converted monsters from D2X to angband format
Can change monsters by replacing r_info.txt with one of r_normal.txt,
r_nightmare.txt or r_hell.txt

Most monsters come in small groups, groups of monsters are scattered
Monsters which have an ESCORT look in r_info.txt for the type, size
depends on escort type
Removed old FRIEND/FRIENDS/ESCORTS code
Made monsters that should only appear as an escort/minion/etc rare
MULTIPLY flag creates the monster's specified escort if one exists
Changed MON_MULT_ADJ from 8 to 4 (doubled chance of monsters multiplying)
Reduced chance for new monsters to be created from 1/160 to 1/1000

Summoned monsters appear around the summoner
Got rid of S_ANT/SPIDER/HOUND/HYRDA/ANGEL/DRAGON/HI_DRAGON flags
No monster summoning can summon uniques anymore

5 quests for each difficulty level (Andariel, Duriel, Mephisto, Diablo
and Baal), 1 for each act
Quest levels give the name of their guardian now
Added a hack to put only hell bovines on levels after Baal's level
Added stray cows to the town

Added DROP_60 to most monsters, group leaders get DROP_1D2 and
ONLY_ITEM, uniques get DROP_3D2, DROP_GOOD and ONLY_ITEM

Changed the damage of monster bolts/balls/breaths

Other
~~~~~
Cumulative lite
Temporary infravision has radius 5 (since it cannot be gained via race)
