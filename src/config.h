 * OPTION: Forbid the use of "fiddled" savefiles.  As far as I can tell,
 * a fiddled savefile is one with an internal timestamp different from
 * the actual timestamp.  Thus, turning this option on forbids one from
 * copying a savefile to a different name.  Combined with disabling the
 * ability to save the game without quitting, and with some method of
 * stopping the user from killing the process at the tombstone screen,
 * this should prevent the use of backup savefiles.  It may also stop
 * the use of savefiles from other platforms, so be careful.

 * OPTION: Forbid the "savefile over-write" cheat, in which you simply

 * either locks the savefile, or creates a fake "xxx.lok" file to prevent
 * the use of the savefile until the file is deleted.  Not ready yet.

 * The configure script overrides this value.  Check the "--prefix=<dir>"
 * option of the configure script.

 * This value will be over-ridden by the "ANGBAND_PATH" environment
 * variable, if that variable is defined and accessible.  The final
 * "slash" is required if the value supplied is in fact a directory.
 *
 * Using the value "./lib/" below tells Angband that, by default,
 * the user will run "angband" from the same directory that contains
 * the "lib" directory.  This is a reasonable (but imperfect) default.
 *
 * If at all possible, you should change this value to refer to the
 * actual location of the "lib" folder, for example, "/tmp/angband/lib/"
 * or "/usr/games/lib/angband/", or "/pkg/angband/lib".
