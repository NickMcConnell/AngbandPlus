/* generate.c: level generation */

#include "posband.h"

/*
 * Note that Level generation is *not* an important bottleneck,
 * though it can be annoyingly slow on older machines...  Thus
 * we emphasize "simplicity" and "correctness" over "speed".
 *
 * This entire file is only needed for generating levels.
 * This may allow smart compilers to only load it when needed.
 *
 * Consider the "vault.txt" file for vault generation.
 *
 * In this file, we use the "special" granite and perma-wall sub-types,
 * where "basic" is normal, "inner" is inside a room, "outer" is the
 * outer wall of a room, and "solid" is the outer wall of the dungeon
 * or any walls that may not be pierced by corridors.  Thus the only
 * wall type that may be pierced by a corridor is the "outer granite"
 * type.  The "basic granite" type yields the "actual" corridors.
 *
 * Note that we use the special "solid" granite wall type to prevent
 * multiple corridors from piercing a wall in two adjacent locations,
 * which would be messy, and we use the special "outer" granite wall
 * to indicate which walls "surround" rooms, and may thus be "pierced"
 * by corridors entering or leaving the room.
 *
 * Note that a tunnel which attempts to leave a room near the "edge"
 * of the dungeon in a direction toward that edge will cause "silly"
 * wall piercings, but will have no permanently incorrect effects,
 * as long as the tunnel can *eventually* exit from another side.
 * And note that the wall may not come back into the room by the
 * hole it left through, so it must bend to the left or right and
 * then optionally re-enter the room (at least 2 grids away).  This
 * is not a problem since every room that is large enough to block
 * the passage of tunnels is also large enough to allow the tunnel
 * to pierce the room itself several times.
 *
 * Note that no two corridors may enter a room through adjacent grids,
 * they must either share an entryway or else use entryways at least
 * two grids apart.  This prevents "large" (or "silly") doorways.
 *
 * To create rooms in the dungeon, we first divide the dungeon up
 * into "blocks" of 11x11 grids each, and require that all rooms
 * occupy a rectangular group of blocks.  As long as each room type
 * reserves a sufficient number of blocks, the room building routines
 * will not need to check bounds.  Note that most of the normal rooms
 * actually only use 23x11 grids, and so reserve 33x11 grids.
 *
 * Note that the use of 11x11 blocks (instead of the 33x11 panels)
 * allows more variability in the horizontal placement of rooms, and
 * at the same time has the disadvantage that some rooms (two thirds
 * of the normal rooms) may be "split" by panel boundaries.  This can
 * induce a situation where a player is in a room and part of the room
 * is off the screen.  This can be so annoying that the player must set
 * a special option to enable "non-aligned" room generation.
 *
 * Note that the dungeon generation routines are much different (2.7.5)
 * and perhaps "DUN_ROOMS" should be less than 50.
 *
 * XXX XXX XXX Note that it is possible to create a room which is only
 * connected to itself, because the "tunnel generation" code allows a
 * tunnel to leave a room, wander around, and then re-enter the room.
 *
 * XXX XXX XXX Note that it is possible to create a set of rooms which
 * are only connected to other rooms in that set, since there is nothing
 * explicit in the code to prevent this from happening.  But this is less
 * likely than the "isolated room" problem, because each room attempts to
 * connect to another room, in a giant cycle, thus requiring at least two
 * bizarre occurances to create an isolated section of the dungeon.
 *
 * Note that (2.7.9) monster pits have been split into monster "nests"
 * and monster "pits".  The "nests" have a collection of monsters of a
 * given type strewn randomly around the room (jelly, animal, or undead),
 * while the "pits" have a collection of monsters of a given type placed
 * around the room in an organized manner (orc, troll, giant, dragon, or
 * demon).  Note that both "nests" and "pits" are now "level dependant",
 * and both make 16 "expensive" calls to the "get_mon_num()" function.
 *
 * Note that the cave grid flags changed in a rather drastic manner
 * for Angband 2.8.0 (and 2.7.9+), in particular, dungeon terrain
 * features, such as doors and stairs and traps and rubble and walls,
 * are all handled as a set of 64 possible "terrain features", and
 * not as "fake" objects (440-479) as in pre-2.8.0 versions.
 *
 * The 64 new "dungeon features" will also be used for "visual display"
 * but we must be careful not to allow, for example, the user to display
 * hidden traps in a different way from floors, or secret doors in a way
 * different from granite walls, or even permanent granite in a different
 * way from granite.  XXX XXX XXX
 *
 * Notes for NPPAngband 0.2.0
 * The addition of smaller (arena) levels was causing the level generation routine
 * to lock up approximately once every 200-300 generated levels.  Occasionally a
 * level with only one or zero rooms is generated, and functions such as place_player_spot
 * would lock up in an infinite soop trying to find a suitable spot.  To fix this, it was
 * simpler to reject the level and have things start over, rather than try to
 * identify and fix the problem.  Code was adopted from EY Angband, which uses an array for
 * tracking the rooms, rather than just marking them in the dungeon floor array.  Notice all
 * of the "while (true) loops now have an escape mechanism, and many of the functions have
 * been changed to bool.  If they return false, the level is considered defective
 * (ex. 5000 chances to place the player fail), and level generation is re-started.
 * I generated over 50,000 levels without incident once I made these changes. JG
 *
 * Notes for PosBand 0.3.0
 * Extra terrain features (lava, grass and so on) required some hacking
 * of this level generator. One particularly time-consuming feature is "decayed" levels.
 * Still, it requires just the normal O(n) time (or so I think).

/*
 * Type 6 -- Monster pits
 *
 * A monster pit is a "big" room, with an "inner" room, containing
 * a "collection" of monsters of a given type organized in the room.
 *
 * Monster types in the pit
 *   orc pit	(Dungeon Level 5 and deeper)
 *   troll pit	(Dungeon Level 20 and deeper)
 *   giant pit	(Dungeon Level 40 and deeper)
 *   dragon pit	(Dungeon Level 60 and deeper)
 *   demon pit	(Dungeon Level 80 and deeper)
 *
 * The inside room in a monster pit appears as shown below, where the
 * actual monsters in each location depend on the type of the pit
 *
 *   #####################
 *   #0000000000000000000#
 *   #0112233455543322110#

 *   #0000000000000000000#
 *   #####################
 *
 * Note that the monsters in the pit are now chosen by using "get_mon_num()"
 * to request 16 "appropriate" monsters, sorting them by level, and using
 * the "even" entries in this sorted list for the contents of the pit.
 *
 * Hack -- all of the "dragons" in a "dragon" pit must be the same "color",
 * which is handled by requiring a specific "breath" attack for all of the
 * dragons.  This may include "multi-hued" breath.  Note that "wyrms" may
 * be present in many of the dragon pits, if they have the proper breath.
 *
 * Note the use of the "get_mon_num_prep()" function, and the special
 * "get_mon_num_hook()" restriction function, to prepare the "monster
 * allocation table" in such a way as to optimize the selection of
 * "appropriate" non-unique monsters for the pit.
 *
 * Note that the "get_mon_num()" function may (rarely) fail, in which case
 * the pit will be empty, and will not effect the level rating.
 *
 * Note that "monster pits" will never contain "unique" monsters.

/*
 * Make a starburst room. -LM-
 *
 * Starburst rooms are made in three steps:
 * 1: Choose a room size-dependant number of arcs.  Large rooms need to
 *    look less granular and alter their shape more often, so they need
 *    more arcs.
 * 2: For each of the arcs, calculate the portion of the full circle it
 *    includes, and its maximum effect range (how far in that direction
 *    we can change features in).  This depends on room size, shape, and
 *    the maximum effect range of the previous arc.
 * 3: Use the table "get_angle_to_grid" to supply angles to each grid in
 *    the room.  If the distance to that grid is not greater than the
 *    maximum effect range that applies at that angle, change the feature
 *    if appropriate (this depends on feature type).
 *
 * Usage notes:
 * - This function uses a table that cannot handle distances larger than
 *   20, so it calculates a distance conversion factor for larger rooms.
 * - This function is not good at handling rooms much longer along one axis
 *   than the other.
 * - It is safe to call this function on areas that might contain vaults or
 *   pits, because "icky" and occupied grids are left untouched.
 *
 * - Mixing these rooms (using normal floor) with rectangular ones on a
 *   regular basis produces a somewhat chaotic looking dungeon.  However,
 *   this code does works well for lakes, etc.
