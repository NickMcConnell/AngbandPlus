Changes in FrogComposband 7.0.strawberry (compared to ComPosband 7.0.3):

* Rebalanced artifact reforging. The goal was to prevent silly-powerful items
while still allowing very strong items (so a character can reasonably expect
to use reforged items in the endgame and final fights). The importance of
fame in reforging was reduced slightly to make early/mid-game reforging more
appealing, though realistically reforging will likely remain mostly a
late-game thing. Slot weights were also adjusted slightly, with effects on
both reforging and randart creation. The hard cap of 90000 on the source
artifact's power was removed, although stronger artifacts will still be
treated as if they had a power of 90000, or even less for less weighty slots.
This prevents situations in which a very strong item is effectively worse
than a weaker item because it doesn't fit the player's needs directly and
cannot ever be reforged. Reforging is now also slightly cheaper

* Rebalanced shop shuffling. The cheap shuffling introduced in ComPosband
allowed characters to acquire silly piles of extremely powerful consumables
very easily, as long as they found a dungeon shop and had enough money. The
cheap shuffling has been retained, but many of the most powerful items
(like !Healing, !*Healing*, !Life, stat potions, ?Genocide, ?MassGenocide and
!NewLife) can no longer be generated on a shuffle. Also, Black Market
shuffling is more expensive now

* Moved Thalos, and added a new town (Anambar) where Thalos used to be.
Prettied up the Thalos map (and edited t_pref to include additional
terrain types). Mt. Olympus is now slightly more accessible since Thalos
is closer to it than any town was before (originally, I moved Thalos even
closer to Mt. Olympus, but then I decided I didn't hate you players enough).
There's an option to allow teleporting to Thalos as soon as any two other
towns (including Outpost) have been visited (because I decided I didn't want
you players to hate me either...!)

* Fixed an old PosChengband bug where quest seeds were lost on save/load,
meaning players who exited the game after requesting a quest would receive
a seed of 0 for that quest and consequently always get the first item from
a list of supposedly random rewards

* Fixed another old PosChengband bug whereby uniques seen through fuzzy
telepathy would sometimes acquire a stray "the" in front of their name
(e.g. "The Gertrude dies.")

* Fixed an old bug with file handling on Windows

* Fixed several minor old bugs related to weapon slays (chaos weapons were
getting massive extra damage against good monsters from the KILL_EVIL flag
instead of the KILL_GOOD flag; the displayed damage for a KILL_HUMAN
missile didn't match the actual damage; in the character sheet, the *Human*
slay's statistics were displayed for weapons with KILL_LIVING rather than
weapons with KILL_HUMAN)

* Updated the rumor list and silly name list

* Added a new realm (Law) and two new classes (Lawyer and Ninja-Lawyer)

* Added new monsters (and restored the deleted Egyptian gods)

* Added a few artifacts (and brought back the GHB's T-shirt)

* Added new random artifact names

* Added new quests (I actually feel like there may be too many early-game
quests now; feedback on the number of quests, and quests [whether new or old]
that players like or don't like, would be particularly welcome; of course,
there is no need to attempt to do every quest in the game at depth)

* In ComPosband, if a quest level was buggy and didn't generate properly, the
game would crash and the player would be forced to fail it on resuming play.
In FrogComposband, while the game will still crash, the player can continue
normally on resumption and can retake the quest after it has been fixed.
This should make life easier for both developers and test-players

* Gave eldraks a significant buff, they are now stronger than ettins
(consequently, swapped ettin and eldrak in the troll evolution sequence;
however, player trolls still evolve into ettins rather than eldraks)

* A small number of monsters can now initiate melee attacks from 2 squares
away. (Fair's fair - player samurai, dragons and archaeologists with whips
can do this!) Currently the only monsters with this ability are large
dinosaurs, novice archaeologists, balrogs, samurai, Godzilla and Jormungand.
(Jormungand, who was a soft guardian for its depth, also received a number
of other buffs; most notably, it now has the CAN_SWIM flag instead of the
AQUATIC flag.)

* Made ninjas slightly less outrageous by nerfing Bunshin (which now gives
a 1-in-3 chance of evading attacks, not 1-in-2) and Swap Position (which
now requires perfectly clear line of sight) and changing their weight limit
equation. The Swap Position nerf also affects the relevant mutation and
wild talent (the weight limit change does not affect other classes with a
weight limit, apart from ninja-lawyers)

* Restored the option of playing without virtues

* Fixed some typos here and there. (I know this will offend some people! But
they can take solace in that there are still plenty left.)

* Buffed Lucifer and made him dungeon boss of Hell

* The name of Sultan the Midget was reverted back to Snafu the Midget
(because of the one-Sultan rule - there's a sultan in Thalos)

* Players are now less likely to be ambushed by dangerous high-level sea
monsters in coastal towns

* Added some alternatives for non-English keyboards to support play on
angband.live: Y and Z for [ and {, Ctrl+Y for Ctrl+W, Ctrl+E for @ and
Ctrl+O for ]

* Made free action stronger because Chris's system was somewhat confusing
and unpopular, though the change here is not as big as what Gwarl did in
ComPosband 7.0.4. 1 source of free action works the same in FrogComposband
as in ComPosband 7.0.3 (and the last versions of PosChengband). 2 sources
are slightly stronger in FrogComposband (and give total paralysis immunity
against low-level monsters), and 3 sources give total immunity against all
monsters, except in special cases like ty_curse

* Changed how cur SP is calculated after a change to max SP

* Restored the old non-fuzzy telepathy as an option. Chris's fuzzy telepathy
is still the default

* Added an option (off by default) to force a -more- prompt on device/spell
fails

* Attempts to charm a monster with the hidden NOPET flag now give the message
"X is immune", rather than "X resists"; the NOPET flag is unpopular enough
without it making players guess whether the monster has it or not. (It's
also now slightly harder for monsters to acquire the NOPET flag.)

* Commented out the Windows pref file (font-win.prf). Windows users will
notice this as a change to the default appearance of walls and mountains

* Various minor tweaks and code improvements

Changes copied or adapted from ComPosband 7.0.4:

* Added Gwarl's new quests and adopted some of his changes to existing
quests

* The entrance to Hideout is now in Outpost, and the entrance to Icky Cave
is now in Thalos

* Adapted the new acid floor

* Magic shop now sells offensive wands

* Moved Tidal Cave

* Battlefield's entrance guardian is now a black wraith instead of a grave
wight

* Visual change to the appearance of Crystal Castle's glass floor

* Added Gwarl's buff to non-specialist riding

* Tweaked the depth and rarity of a number of items, especially dragon
scale mails (but not quite to the same extent as in ComPosband 7.0.4)

* Tweaked a number of monsters

-------------------------------------------------------

To do:

* Add a new high-level quest in Zul that, upon completion, enables
teleporting between Zul and other towns

* Bring back the Lazy personality

* Look into adding new classes

* Look into making easy ID more powerful

* Look into adapting the bank from Frogspawn

* Look into updating the no_wilderness town

* Make it possible to select Floor with the '-' key in the inscription menu

* Review the effect that Chris's changes to FA/SI/fear have on unusual
races like rings and death-swords, and fix the problems

* Fix the bug that causes fear messages to take the form "Him flees in
terror!" instead of "He flees in terror!"

* Examine MITZE's bug with quest_unique turned off, and fix if needed
