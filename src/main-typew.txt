This one is a bit tricky, you have type the output manually. And because of the limited computing power of the Typewriter, 
you'll have to do most of the computing on Graph paper with the help of a slide rule.

Algorithm for running Sil-Q on a typewriter:
1. Compile the source into assembly using the makefile for GCU mode sicne that will give you an output that can be typed out on your typewriter.
2. Copy out the relevant diagrams and tables for an x86-64 precessor, you'll need these in your calculations. 
3. Take out your slide rule and graph paper
4. Start crunching numbers, this step may take up to several years. Be patient and DON'T PANICK.
5. Type out the resulting output on your typewriter.
6. Mark your desired input in a notebook, then repeat step 4. from where you left off taking into account the input you just wrote down.
7. Type out the resulting output either below your previous output or on top of it using an eraser ribbon or white out.

The game can now be played by repeating steps 6. and 7. , All on your very own typewriter!
