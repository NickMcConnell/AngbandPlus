"Life magic is very good for healing; it relies mostly on healing, protection and detection spells. Also life magic have a few attack spells as well. It said that some high level spell of life magic can disintegrate Undead monsters into ash.",
"Sorcery is a `meta` realm, including enchantment and general spells. It provides superb protection spells, spells to enhance your odds in combat and, most importantly, a vast selection of spells for gathering information. However, Sorcery has one weakness: it has no spells to deal direct damage to your enemies.",
"Nature magic makes you master of elements; it provides protection, detection, curing and attack spells. Nature also has a spell of Herbal Healing, which is the only powerful healing spell outside the realm of Life magic.",
"There are few types of magic more unpredictable and difficult to control than Chaos magic. Chaos is the very element of unmaking, and the Chaos spells are the most terrible weapons of destruction imaginable. The caster can also call on the primal forces of Chaos to induce mutations in his/her opponents and even him/herself.",
"There is no fouler nor more evil category of spells than the necromantic spells of Death Magic. These spells are relatively hard to learn, but at higher levels the spells give the caster power over living and the (un)dead, but the most powerful spells need his / her own blood as the focus, often hurting the caster in the process of casting.",
"Trump magic has, indeed, an admirable selection of teleportation spells. Since the Trump gateways can also be used to summon other creatures, Trump magic has an equally impressive selection of summoning spells. However, not all monsters appreciate being drawn to another place by Trump user.",
"Arcane magic is a general purpose realm of magic. It attempts to encompass all 'useful' spells from all realms. This is the downside of Arcane magic: while Arcane does have all the necessary 'tool' spells for a dungeon delver, it has no ultra-powerful high level spells. As a consequence, all Arcane spellbooks can be bought in town. It should also be noted that the 'specialized' realms usually offer the same spell at a lower level and cost. ",
"Craft magic can strengthen the caster or the equipments. These spells can greatly improve the caster's fighting ability. Using them against opponents directly is not possible.",
"Demon is a very evil realm, same as Death. It provides various attack spells and devilish detection spells. at higher levels, Demon magic provides ability to dominate demons, and to polymorph yourself into a demon.",
"Crusade is a magic of 'Justice'. It includes damage spells, which are greatly effective against foul and evil monsters, but have poor effects against good monsters.",
"Necromancy allows communication with and ultimately control over the deceased. All direct damage afforded by this realm requires the caster to touch his or her opponent. Any weapons or gloves will obstruct this macabre contact.",
"Armageddon is the most deadly offensive realm. You won't be lacking for firepower here. "
    "However, every spell is an offensive spell, so this realm suffers from a lack of any "
    "utility spells.",
"Experts in Law know many ways to confuse and hinder their enemies, to set and detect traps, to escape difficult situations and to win others to their side. However, they are somewhat lacking in direct offensive power.",
"Music adepts affect the world around them by singing songs. There are two types of song; some have instant effects, while others have a continuous effect until SP runs out. But the latter type has a limit: only one song can be sung at a time.",
"The books of Kendo describe about various combat techniques. When learning new techniques, you are required to carry the books, but once you memorizes them, you don't have to carry them. When using a technique, wielding a weapon is required.",
"Hex is a very terrible realm. Spells gives continual effects when they are spelled continually like songs. Spells may obstract monsters' actions, may deal damages in sight, may revenge against enemies.",
"The books of Rage describe various techniques. To learn a new technique, you must perform a ritual of rage, destroying the book in the process."
    " Once learned, you may use techniques without requiring the corresponding Rage book, but you will need to find many copies of each book in order"
    " to learn all of the techniques.",
"Burglary is the preferred realm of rogues, allowing them to specialize in what they do best: Stealing! "
    "This realm offers good detection and escapes, offers talents for picking pockets and setting traps, "
    "and even allows for direct assassination of sleeping monsters. The books for this realm are only "
    "available in the Black Market (or in the dungeon).",
